Source- mah belly! I love this Sobe Lifewater in Pacific Coconut Flavor. \u00a0I absolutely love this stuff! \u00a0I take a bottle of it with me to work every day. \u00a0I find it to be very refreshing. I've been obsessively looking at Farmhouse tables lately, because guess what, we are going to build one! \u00a0I think this one is really cool, and I love the bench and the mismatched chairs as well. \u00a0Although I probably won't paint ours that dark on the bottom, I love the style of this one. Source This Rustoleum comfort grip will attach to any spray can. \u00a0I received it for free in my swag bag from the Haven Conference I attended in July, but I used it for the first time this past weekend. \u00a0And wow! It changed my spray painting life! \u00a0I will never again spray paint without it! \u00a0 Source There have been very few times that I have seen a nail color someone was wearing and liked it so much that I went out and bought it. \u00a0But recently I did just that! \u00a0I have a friend at work who was wearing this sparkly, iridescent bright blue on her fingers and toes, and I couldn't stop staring at it. \u00a0 She told me it was Sally Hansen Miracle Gel, so the next time I went to a store that carried it, I picked some up, and my toes are sporting this color right now. \u00a0And I love it! \u00a0 Source And that\u2019s a wrap for What I\u2019m loving right now!\u00a0 I hope you like it!\u00a0 I thought it would be a fun way to bring you some cool stuff.\u00a0 do you have something that you are loving right now that you want to share with me, or that you think I will like?\u00a0 If so, tell me about it in the comments, I love trying new things!\u00a0 Have a great week!

According to the figures, small business in the hospitality sector have enjoyed a seven per cent increase in turnover over the past year alone. \r \n\nBusinesses diversifying to meet changing needs of holidaymakers \r \n\nAnd it's not just hotels who are benefiting from the trend that has seen growing numbers of Brits ditch foreign holidays in favour of breaks closer to home; restaurants, theme parks, cafes and even normal high street shops are also cashing in as people stay at home instead of heading off for some foreign sunshine. \r \n\nCommenting on the trend, Karen Thomas from Barclays explained: \"We have seen a number of businesses adapt and diversify to make the most of seasonal tourism particularly during summer months. \r \n\n\"Great beaches, local landmarks and beautiful scenery are just some of the drivers of regional tourism, while many accommodation businesses are catering for the nation\u2019s appetite for more unusual places to rest their head, such as a yurt or camper van.\"\r \n\nThe latest research shows that the South West of England remains the number one staycation spot for Brits, with Welsh beaches and shopping destinations in the north of England also big hits. \r\n\r\n\r \n\n13 September 2015, 23","title":"Businesses cash in on huge boom in stayc...","media-type":"News","source":"UK Net Guide","published":"2015-09-15T11:37:52Z"}

Morais, who was attached to the Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers, was reported missing on September 4 after leaving his Menara Duta residence, for work. Mohmad Salleh said the body of Morais was found after one of the suspects led police to a swampy area at Taman Perumahan USJ 1, Persiaran Subang Mewah, near the Klang River where a drum containing his body was dumped. He said the seven, comprising four men aged between 22 and 52, two women and a child, were detained yesterday after investigation of Morais\u2019 disappearance on September 4.

It builds upon the innovative brush-less design of the Roomba 880 , but adds a whole load of new gear to make it a better robot. It can actually map your floors and make sure it thoroughly cleans your entire house. And it also marks iRobot's entry into the smart home arena -- the Roomba 980 works with the company's new \"HOME\" app, which allows you to control and monitor it from anywhere in the world. But like every new Roomba, it's pretty pricy at $899. Is it worth it? \n Roomba 980 hands-on    \n \n   \n \n   \n \n   \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n+ See all 10\/ \n   \nIn the video above, iRobot product manager Shilpi Gupta gives us a good look at how, exactly the Roomba 980 does its magic. The combination of a brush-less design (which means you don't have to worry about getting hair and gunk out of dirty brushes) and its new smarts makes it the first Roomba you don't have to actively babysit. I've gotten used to clearing the floor and being prepared to leap in to save my Roomba 600-series whenever it gets into a spot of trouble, and I hear similar tales from other Roomba owners. \n \nWhile it looks similar to past Roombas, the 980 features a small camera on its top and a slightly reworked handle. It's also significantly heavier than earlier models, owing to all of the new electronics inside it. We'll have to spend some serious cleaning time with the new Roomba before we can make any final judgements, but at this point it's certainly tempting. \n \n \n \nArticle source: http:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2015\/09\/18\/roomba-980-hands-on\/","title":"Hands-on with the smarter, WiFi-equipped Roomba 980","media-type":"Blog","source":"xvid entertainment news","published":"2015-09-19T09:44:11Z"}

{"id":"661359f6-cc63-4065-b057-822dc9102e43","content":"Sept. 08--Downtown Dayton's RTA transit center will start offering fruits and vegetables for sale on Thursday to help improve access to healthy food choices. \n\nSome parts of Montgomery County, especially neighborhoods in West Dayton, lack grocery stores and markets that sell fresh produce, said Montgomery County Commissioner Judy Dodge. \n\nThe Market at Wright Stop Plaza will provide a convenient way for bus riders to pick up affordable and nutritious food items before heading home, said Dodge, who is co-chair of the county's Food Policy Coalition. \n\nThe new farmer's market also will be only the second in the county to accept food stamp benefits, officials said. \n\n\"We just think it's a wonderful start to get people to come in and purchase some good, fresh fruits and vegetables,\" Dodge said. \n\nFour wooden carts will likely open inside of the Greater Dayton RTA Wright Stop Plaza later this month. \n\nThe stands will have a variety of seasonal fruits and vegetables for sale that come from local farms. \n\nThe market at the plaza will be open all-year round from noon to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday. \n\nHomefull, a local nonprofit, will be the market manager and will staff the stands. The project is the work of an all-volunteer group. \n\nThe pilot program, which received $50,000 in start-up funding from MCOFuture, will last a year. However, organizers hope it will become a permanent and self-sustaining operation. \n\n\"It's going to be like ice-skating for a while -- we'll be kind of shaky, and then we'll get going and it'll be like Dorothy Hamill,\" Dodge said. \n\nMany bus riders lack access to cars and live miles from stores that have healthy food, like leafy vegetables, Dodge said. \n\nDodge pointed to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that shows about 30 percent of the county's population have limited access to grocery stores. The data shows almost 60 percent of these residents are low-income. \n\nMany residents have diets that can impact their health and shorten their lives, she said. \n\nThere \"is a high rate of diabetes and obesity with our children in Montgomery County,\" she said. \n\nThe transit center has more than 9,000 boardings per weekday, said Frank Ecklar, RTA spokesman. \n\n\"This new fruit\/vegetable stand will offer healthy alternatives for our customers or anyone else who visits the Wright Stop Plaza,\" he said. \n\nMost vendors at the center sell snacks, candy, soda and fast-food products, many of which have little nutritional value. \n\nAlso, the market soon will feature an area for food-resource educators, who will provide food-nutrition lessons, recipe ideas and maybe even budgeting advice, said Cathy Startzman, Dodge's commission assistant who worked on the market's advisory committee. \n\nStartzman envisions educators will have samples of kale salads, kohlrabi, turnips or other healthy goods for visitors to try. \n\n\"This is really about providing food access for people who have difficulty,\" she said. \n\nThe farmers market will accept electronic food stamp benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It will be only the second market in the county to accept SNAP. \n\nShiloh Farmers' Market on Philadelphia Drive also participates in the program. \n\nThe market also will offer \"Produce Perks,\" which provide food stamp recipients a dollar-for-dollar match for up to $10 spent at the stands, Startzman said. \n\n\"They will get $10 for free, so it will double up that purchase,\" she said. \n\nThe incentive is offered in other communities, including Hamilton and Cuyahoga counties.","title":"OH: Market at RTA Transit Center to Offer Fruits and Vegetables","media-type":"News","source":"Mass Transit Magazine","published":"2015-09-08T14:45:33Z"}
{"id":"51c7c5a8-fb6e-456e-a4ae-12779fa75ff7","content":"at 12:47a ET \n  \nThe Baltimore Orioles can sweep the latest Beltway Series partly because they've controlled the opposing heart of the order and the Washington Nationals haven't. \n \nRegardless of what their big hitters do, the Orioles and Nationals are unlikely to make the playoffs even though neither is far removed from having a very realistic chance to repeat as East Division champions. \n \nBaltimore enters Thursday's season series finale in D.C. officially eliminated from the AL East chase after first-place Toronto won Wednesday. The Orioles (75-76) last led the division July 2 and were within four games of first Aug. 17 but went on to lose 13 of 15. The current 10-4 stretch has them four behind Houston for the second wild-card spot with 11 to play, but Minnesota and the Los Angeles Angels are also ahead of them. \n \nWashington (78-73) is all but out of wild-card contention and six back of the New York Mets in the NL East. The Nationals led the division as recently as Aug. 2 but were amid a 4-13 stretch that let the Mets take control, and they wasted a chance to gain ground by losing 4-1 to the Orioles on Tuesday and 4-3 on Wednesday. \n \nPrior to those defeats, Bryce Harper and Jayson Werth keyed a 7-1 span with nine home runs and 20 RBIs. Harper has drawn five walks in this series but was retired in his other three plate appearances. Issuing free passes to the MVP candidate has been a good strategy because Werth, batting cleanup behind Harper, is 0 for 8 while leaving 10 men on base. \n \nBaltimore has had no such problems despite cleanup man Adam Jones missing both games with back spasms. Steve Pearce stepped in to deliver a two-run homer Wednesday and an RBI double Tuesday while batting behind Chris Davis, who has two doubles and an RBI. \n \nIt was No. 2 hitter Manny Machado , though, who had the biggest blow with a go-ahead, two-run homer off Max Scherzer in the seventh inning Wednesday. \n \nThere may be some lingering ill will after Nationals closer Jonathan Papelbon threw high and tight to Machado in the ninth and later plunked him on the upper arm. Machado yelled toward Papelbon, who was ejected, and the benches briefly cleared. \n \n\"When you throw at somebody's head on purpose first pitch, straight out the get-go, then you throw a curveball, then you throw again at the head, that's just ... ,\" Machado said using a street term. \"You know it's coward stuff. It's just coward.\" \n \nHarper is anticipating some retaliation. \n \n\"I mean Manny freaking hit a homer,\" Harper said. \"Walked it off and somebody drilled him. I mean, it's pretty tired. It's one of those situations where it happens and, I don't know, I'll probably get drilled tomorrow.\" \n \nThe one to do it could be Tyler Wilson (2-2, 3.72 ERA). \n \nThe promising rookie is getting a try in Baltimore's rotation after being recalled last week, but he lost at Tampa Bay on Friday by allowing six runs and eight hits in 4 1-3 innings. The right-hander, who turns 26 on Friday, had a 2.19 ERA in six previous appearances for Baltimore, including two spot starts. \n \n\"You got to keep in mind these guys have never really pitched in September before,\" manager Buck Showalter told MLB's official website. \"So it's part of the process, and I think he will learn from it. He's a sharp, competitive guy.\" \n \nWashington goes with Tanner Roark (4-6, 4.73), who has failed to pitch past the fifth inning in three starts since his call-up. \n \nHis worst performance since returning came last Thursday when he surrendered six runs and eight hits in a 6-4 loss at Miami, though Roark said it was an effort he could \"build off.\" He has a 5.66 ERA in nine starts this season.","title":"Orioles-Nationals Preview","media-type":"News","source":"Yard Barker","published":"2015-09-24T04:51:16Z"}

These development interventions are effectively improving the current conditions of the target population. \n\nThe CABEI Vice President also summarized CABEI\u2019s contribution to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) with regard to water and sanitation, declaring that over 55 years, the Bank has approved US$784 million in the area, 85% of which, amounting to US$667.47 million, has been disbursed over the last ten years. Thus, CABEI has contributed to increasing universal potable water coverage by promoting efficient extraction and distribution methods to avoid losses; improving sanitation mechanisms; treating water to prepare it for human consumption; wastewater treatment; and promoting active social participation to ensure the sustainability of the services. \n\nThe forum provided a platform for experts to analyze global technological and cooperation issues in order to deal with the problem of water scarcity.","title":"CABEI inaugurates regional water and sanitation forum","media-type":"News","source":"Central American Bank for EI","published":"2015-09-28T23:59:36Z"}

Ski magazines and web sites hype the new products and make them sound better than the previous batch. In many cases skiers didn\u2019t have a good relationship with their boots to begin with, so they are ready to toss the old ones that are in the closet. After all, you eked out 4 years in the boots that never really fit and didn\u2019t make you ski any better, so it\u2019s time for a change.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What does boot fitting include?\nI can only speak for myself and what we do at Harb Ski Systems. Here is what helps you get a good result..\nJust about every season there will be a new line of boots, perhaps a new brand, and small or large modifications to existing boot lines. Regardless of what the advertising says, if we recommend boots we have to know \u00a0how they ski. We test numerous boots from different companies before we buy them for our store, and we observe how they fit and work for a variety of our skiing customers. In this \u00a0way we already know the strengths and characteristics of the models and brands. \u00a0Knowing what a ski boot does to your skiing is super important before you buy. They are all different and they will perform differently. Initial selection:\nAt the very minimum, the boot fitter needs to measure both of your feet for length and width. A discussion of your boot-wearing experience is in order - have you owned or rented boots; aspects you have liked; aspects you have not liked; and so on. We give the customer, our client, the opportunity to tell us what they are looking for in a ski boot. It helps us to know where they ski, how they like to ski, and what is important to them in how their boots fit and ski.\nA good foot fitter brings out two, if not three models of boots to test the initial fit and response from a customer. [There are some situations where this won\u2019t be the case. If your feet are extra-narrow, extra-wide, extra-big, extra-small, or extra-anything, even a good shop with a large boot selection may only have one boot that is a valid candidate for you.]\u00a0\nThe fitter removes the liner and has the customer put on the boot shells alone to test pure foot room or space inside the shell. Just going by shoe size and boot markings is not accurate enough. Showing the customer how much room their feet have in the shell reassures the customer that the boot can be made comfortable, even when the initial \u00a0try-on seems tight in length. Every good boot fitter has a try-on and foot insertion protocol. This protocol can make all the difference in the world, not only for the initial experience, but also for long term comfort. The customer then buckles the boots, stands and walks around for at least 5 minutes and then gives the boot fitter a fit evaluation. The boot fitter asks about how tight or loose the boot is in all areas around the foot and ankle. Knee and ankle bending and boot flexing are also tested at this time. Leg alignment and footbeds:\nThis is the next big step and it\u2019s more involved than trying on the boots. In our shop we measure over 20 foot, ankle and knee functions before the boot is even on the customer\u2019s foot. From these measurements we can determine if the foot will ski well without extra support or whether a footbed will help with comfort and performance. Comfort, support, and foot and ankle function can all point toward either an off-the-rack footbed or a custom footbed.\nWell make custom footbeds, support and flexibility are determined by individual ankle and foot mobility..\nIf a footbed is in order, then it is made and integrated into the boot prior to any other alignment measurements and to any modifications to the boot to increase comfort. \u00a0Next, the \u201cin boot\u201d alignment can be measured, \u00a0modified, and optimized. This process may also include balancing on a slant board to dial in cuff alignment.\nEvery angle and movement function of the body, all the way up to the hips is evaluated before the final product is finalized. Our company has been assessing indoor and on-snow alignment for over twenty years. Our measurements data, from over 5000 skiers, shows that 95 percent of skiers can benefit their skiing experience with boot alignment, which involves sole angle changes to the boot.\nBecause we run ski instruction camps all season we have hands-on experience, with skiers and boots. Every week we see the correlation between boots, indoor measurements, and on-snow performance for multiple skiers of all ability levels. We can come very close to optimal alignment right from the shop. When we work with racers, their coaches see immediate improvement \u00a0after they return to the race courses from alignment sessions. We often ask our customers for video of their skiing before and after boot fitting, as this gives us more knowledge about how and what to do for the best setup, right out of the shop.\nEven with our years of experience in ski coaching and boot work is not an easy process. You must stay current with your coaching and observation of skiers so that you can optimize every aspect of the foot, boot, and ski interface.\nSome advice to boot buyers, : be patient. Don\u2019t take the first self proclaimed boot fitter and think you are getting a slam dunk fitting experience, i . It may not end up they way you expected. Get references \u00a0from other skiers and do the research - \u00a0it will definitely be worthwhile afterward on the slopes.","title":"Ski Boots \"The Harb Way\"!!!","media-type":"Blog","source":"Ski Blog with Harald Harb","published":"2015-09-08T22:18:16Z"}

As Scott Walker bailed out of the Republican herd running for president he suggested maybe even encouraged others to do the same for the benefit of the \"Party.\" That would be the Republican Party, which is precisely the reason the non-traditional candidates are currently so popular. Walker proposed that the field narrow so the \"Party\" could more effectively confront the likes of Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Cary Fiorina. People are simply fed up with the Grand Old Party (GOP). The Republicans were elected to take over the House and the Senate to get things done but have not been able to work together, let alone with the Democrats. To many personal agendas, too much ego, it's more of a riot than a Party. Just the fact they floated 17 candidates for president is a clue that they cannot all get together and set a common direction. As the conservatives drag everyone in the \"Party\" around by the nose, things get messier and messier. The Republican Party is a nice place with lots of money floating around, plenty of loyal consultants and operatives and almost too much individualism. I am pretty sure the public was really not up for a union busting president who liked to brag about being elected three times in four years. Given the state of the world, we just don't have time for that. Walker's call for the \"Party to attack the outsiders, especially Trump\" seems to typify why everyone is so fed up with the professional political class. Whenever all else fails to let's circle the \"Party\" wagons and try to protect the political class. Everyone is waiting for the great \"fade\" to begin as people move from the outsiders back to more traditional candidates. The pundits are predicting it. The Sunday talk-show hosts are praying for it. Editorial pages are screaming for it. Question is: are the people buying it? With Carson's Muslim stumble this week, and Fiorina rising in the polls; the establishment may have their hands full getting the public to move toward Bush or Rubio as primary days draw near. For now, it's just good to see all those career politicians, with all of those wealthy donors in a tizzy because they can't get their way.

But just 15 months after that electoral triumph, disenchantment has set in. \n\nBusinesses as well as young Indians are getting restless with slow progress on the ground. \n\n\"We need to move this (GDP) figure up given the imperative of employment generation,\" said Jyotsna Suri, head of a local industry chamber, FICCI. \n\nA 22-year-old activist has stirred upheaval in Modi's home state Gujarat, accusing the Indian leader of breaking the promise to provide jobs. \n\nRATE CUT? \n\nThe latest data will also strengthen the calls from Modi's administration for a rate cut.

{"id":"72c857fa-ddb1-4edf-a401-af9dcc69581d","content":"We all have a story. If someone asks how you are doing, do you always say with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m fine. How are you?\u201d Or do you tell them how you really are doing? If we always say we\u2019re fine, we are likely not sharing the ups and downs of life. The \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d response could be fine if you are coping well, but what happens when the challenges of life are overwhelming but kept bottled up?\n\nA particularly challenging time in life is adolescence, when teens and pre-teens experience rapid physical, mental and emotional change. How we tell our story or whether we tell it at all can depend on who is listening. Who is listening to the adolescents and young adults in our community? Teens may be hesitant to share their stories because they don\u2019t think anyone will listen or take them seriously, or they feel misunderstood. They need a place to share their ideas and form a sense of belonging.\n\nTeens with mental health concerns can do both at the San Benito County Behavioral Health Esperanza Center in downtown Hollister (544 San Benito St., Suite 102). The Esperanza Center is a place for 16- to 25-year-olds to engage with others in similar situations. It fosters a community of non-judgment and acceptance, and also encourages healthy eating through weekly group meetings.\n\nTeens can also build critical relationships with peers and adults through school and community activities. They can benefit from expressing themselves through art, music, dancing, cooking, writing or other creative endeavors. They can engage in physical activity through organized sports and pick-up games, or through hiking the Pinnacles and biking through the countryside. They can volunteer to feed the hungry or house the homeless, simultaneously helping their community and recognizing their positive impact on others. They can join clubs or teams at school, and join youth religious groups. We encourage adolescents and their friends and family to participate in activities like the local Red Ribbon Run, an annual event that shows our commitment to a drug-free community. This year\u2019s 26th Annual Red Ribbon Run is Oct. 10 and you can Like the Hollister Red Ribbon Run Facebook Page at https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/HollisterRR5K.\n\nPart of the reason our teens and others are reluctant to engage in conversation about mental health concerns is that they continue to carry a degree of stigma that other health problems do not. This can lead youth to feel ashamed of their problems. Programs such as the Each Mind Matters campaign and the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) Prop 63 are addressing this stigma. One such effort, Walk In Our Shoes, http:\/\/www.walkinourshoes.org\/, provides real stories of struggling youth, myths and facts about mental health, and resources for parents and teachers. Each Mind Matters also published a resource for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and\/or questioning (LGBTQ) teens called \u201cBe True and Be You: A Basis Mental Health Guide for LGBTQ Teens.\u201d They refer LGBTQ youth, who have a higher rate of depression and suicide attempts, to call The Trevor Project at 1-866-488-7386 in a mental health crisis. Another project is the Directing Change Student Film Contest where high school students can create 60-second films about suicide prevention or ending the silence about mental illness. To view the videos visit http:\/\/www.directingchange.org\/.\n\nAdolescents may benefit from seeking mental health services when they are experiencing overwhelming difficulties in school, relationships or in daily life in general. The Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) services can assist youth before symptoms get severe. The Youth Alliance is contracted with San Benito County Behavioral Health to provide PEI services in local schools, and adolescents can be referred for mental health services.\n\nWhen youth, parents and caregivers, or professionals have serious concerns, a good resource is http:\/\/www.samhsa.gov\/suicide-prevention from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA). These additional resources are also available:\n\nSuicide Prevention of the Central Coast at 1-877-ONE-LIFE (1-877-663-5433)\n\nThe National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).\n\nSan Benito County Behavioral Health 24\/7 mental health crisis services at 1-888-636-4020 or (831) 636-4020.\n\nI encourage you to take a few moments today and every day to ask the youth in your life how they are doing. And really listen to the answer. Your interest may make a difference for that person\u2019s day, week or even life.","title":"Guest View: Listen to our youth and their answers","media-type":"News","source":"Hollister Freelance","published":"2015-09-25T22:53:00Z"}

The Russians told the United States that they should not fly U.S. warplanes in Syria, but gave no geographical information about where they planned to strike. The senior official said U.S. missions are continuing as normal. \n\n[Previous story, 6:32 a.m. ET] \n\nThe upper house of the Russian parliament has given President Vladimir Putin approval to use the Russian air force in Syria, according to state media. \n\n\"The Federation Council unanimously supported the President's request -- 162 votes in favor of granting permission,\" Kremlin Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov said, according to ITAR-Tass. \n\nThe vote came after a request by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for military assistance in fighting ISIS, Ivanov said. \n\n'They are ready' \n\nRussian airstrikes in Syria could happen at any time, a U.S. official with knowledge of the latest intelligence told CNN this week. \n\n\"They could start at any moment,\" the official said. \"They are ready.\" \n\nAfter several days of Russian familiarization flights, there is no reason they could not begin, the official added. And Russian drones have been collecting potential targeting information in their flights. But the U.S. doesn't know what the Russians have in mind and when they will make a decision on airstrikes. \n\nFour Russian Su-34 Fullback fighter jets are now at the Latakia air base in Syria, and more than 600 Russian troops are in place. \n\nPentagon spokesman Peter Cook told reporters Tuesday that Secretary of Defense Ash Carter directed his staff to \"open lines of communication with Russia on de-confliction.\" \n\nThe timing of these discussions is to be worked out in the coming days. The purpose of the discussions is \"to ensure the safety of coalition air crews,\" he said. \n\nCook added that the two nations have common ground when it comes to fighting ISIS, also known as ISIL, with Carter making clear that \"the goal should be to take the fight to ISIL and not to defend the Assad regime.\" \n\nJust ISIS or something more? \n\nRussia continues to position itself to potentially launch airstrikes in Syria, but its movements suggest that its targets are something other than ISIS, according to U.S. officials. \n\n\"We see some very sophisticated air defenses going into those airfields. We see some very sophisticated air-to-air aircraft going into these airfields. I have not seen ISIL flying any airplanes that require SA-15s or SA-22s (Russian missiles). I have not seen ISIL flying any airplanes that require sophisticated air-to-air capabilities,\" Gen. Phillip Breedlove, NATO's supreme allied commander, said on Monday. \n\n\"I'm looking at the capabilities and the capacities that are being created and I determine from that what might be their intent. These very sophisticated air defense capabilities are not about ISIL. They're about something else,\" he concluded. \n\nSeparately, Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work confirmed to the Senate on Tuesday that Russia has violated a missile treaty with the United States but indicated that the administration didn't plan to take any action at present. \n\nSen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, asked Work at a hearing whether he thought the Russians had breached the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty governing the elimination of medium-range missiles. \n\n\"We believe very strongly that they did,\" he responded. But he also said, \"This is still in discussions and we have not decided on any particular action at this point,\" noting that the United States has been in contact with the Russians over the issue. \n\nU.S. efforts stuck in neutral \n\nMeanwhile, America's own efforts to turn the tide in Syria have faltered once again. \n\nThe Pentagon has stopped moving new recruits from Syria to its training centers in Jordan and Turkey to train and equip moderate rebels to fight ISIS, a U.S. defense official told CNN on Tuesday. The deeply troubled program has several dozen fighters in training right now, but new fighters will not be brought in until the White House makes a decision on how it wants to change the effort. \n\nSeveral options are being considered, including having the rebels train to provide assistance in calling in airstrikes and conducting communications.","title":"Official: Russia conducts first airstrike in Syria","media-type":"News","source":"ABC 17 News","published":"2015-09-30T11:54:24Z"}

Massive traffic snarls in areas around Hussainsagar had a cascading effect and soon large parts of the city were thrown out of gear. \n\nAs arterial roads around Hussainsagar, including the Khairatabad flyover, were closed for normal traffic throughout the day, bottlenecks on roads in Secunderabad, Lakdikapul and Himayatnagar became inevitable. Lakhs of motorists had to experiment with detours to reach their workplaces and back home, covering short distances in long hours. \n\nTo make up for the inordinate delay in start of the main procession from the Old City (South Zone), police gave idols moving from Charminar priority for immersion at Hussainsagar. As a result, the idols from South and West Zone could reach Tank Bund and NTR Marg only by Monday morning. Also, over 1,000 idols -- mainly from West Zone --which were scheduled to be immersed on Friday, started arriving for immersion on Monday as the organisers deferred their plans for reasons untold. \n\nTill 7 am, idols were seen moving towards Hussain Sagar near Lakdikapul, Liberty junction and RTC X roads. \n\nThe Telugu Talli flyover was shut till 11 am, while Tank Bund, NTR Marg, Necklace Road and Khairatabad flyover remained shut till 6 pm. \n\nDue to the traffic restrictions, travelling on the arterial Sardar Patel Road become a nightmare for office-goers till 1 pm. \"To travel an 8-km stretch from my house in Secunderabad to my office at Punjagutta through SP Road, it took me close to one-and-half hours,\" T Sai Chand, an employee of a software firm told TOI. \n\nAs school managements were not forewarned about the possible traffic restrictions, many parents negotiated the bumper-to-bumper jam and reached educational institutions only to be informed by the management that a holiday was declared as many students failed to turn up due to traffic problems.","title":"Arteries closed, city \u2018immersed\u2019 in traffic chaos","media-type":"News","source":"Times of India","published":"2015-09-29T01:02:18Z"}

The webinar will also include supply chain transparency experts from Source Intelligence providing a look into current efforts by major publicly traded companies to meet or exceed investor expectations for responsible sourcing and regulatory requirements. \n\nThe 2015 edition of Mining the Disclosures will introduce improvements to RSN's first-in-kind performance indicators for conflict minerals due diligence. It will rank 155 large cap companies among their peers, which are within 20 industrial sectors with high exposure to conflict minerals. The 2015 report will examine filings submitted to the SEC in June of this year.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nRSN's investor guide is at the forefront of social performance analysis, evaluating filings under Section 1502, the most sweeping social performance data requirements in the history of the SEC. RSN's report is designed to encourage a holistic approach to responsible sourcing and provide investors and stakeholders with deeper insights into social performance efforts by companies. From the original passage of the legislation, RSN and its partners have pushed for comprehensive, transparent, and standardized reporting. \n\nSource Intelligence is hosting the webinar because of its extensive experience and expertise in tracking and monitoring supply chains, validating conflict mineral data for companies. The unique open-source platform provided by Source Intelligence will allow suppliers to efficiently share sourcing reports. Source Intelligence was the most listed third-party investigative and verification resource by publicly traded companies required to file conflict mineral reports with the SEC. \n\nRegister for the webinar here.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nUnder the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, publicly traded companies based in the United States must report whether they use conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and neighboring war-torn countries. Militants in these countries are funding their war efforts through the sale of these raw materials. \n\nMore than 6,000 companies were expected to file with the SEC. However, only a fraction submitted reports, indicating how little reliable information about tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (3TG) supply chains was available before the law was passed. Since its passage in 2010, Section 1502 has brought data and transparency to a trade in minerals whose extraction is often tied to appalling human rights violations.\u00a0 \n\nDespite regulatory and consumer pressure, many global brands have failed to commit to source conflict-free. Only two companies have determined all its 3TG products are conflict-free, with three others determining some product lines to be conflict-free. This has not come as a surprise to observers who understand that applying pressure onto the smelters that process the raw minerals is a complex and time-consuming endeavor. RSN's report highlights those companies that have done an exemplary job of this engagement. \n\nThe conflict mineral issue has prompted thousands of companies to investigate other areas of their supply chain networks to ensure they are meeting ever-expanding sustainability, corporate social responsibility and environmental standards. Source Intelligence, for instance, is assisting companies in ensuring suppliers are providing materials and products without political corruption or slavery issues. \n\nAbout Responsible Sourcing Network (www.sourcingnetwork.org) \n\nResponsible Sourcing Network is a project of the nonprofit organization As You Sow (www.asyousow.org). RSN is dedicated to ending human rights abuses associated with the raw materials found in products we use every day. RSN supports stakeholders in leveraging their influence to achieve and measure impact in the areas of conflict minerals and slave labor. \n\nAbout Source Intelligence\u00ae\u00a0(www.sourceintelligence.com): \n\nSource Intelligence\u00ae (SI) is a global network of businesses linked together to expedite the exchange and validation of compliance information.

The app is meant to be used four times a week for eight weeks, and advertised to create sharper vision and dramatically improve the ability to see in dim light.\u00a0\nThe company made about $350,000 in sales since 2012.\u00a0\nThe commission alleged the company did not have the scientific evidence to back up its advertisements.

In fact, the MacLeods ruled Lewis from the end of the Viking heyday through the early modern era, when they were eclipsed by the Mackenzies in the 17th C.\nGenetic evidence points to their Norse invader lineage. From an article discussing the Y-chromosome that belongs to nearly half of MacLeod men:\nIt is found in Lewis, Harris and Skye, core Macleod territory, but also in Orkney, Shetland and Norway, with a few examples in Sweden. Despite extensive screening, S68 is very specifically located, showing up only once in the east of Scotland and once in England. This is a classic pattern for a Viking marker in Britain, but one much rarer than M17. MacLeods determinedly claim descent from a common name father, a Norse aristocrat called Ljot, a relative of Olaf, King of Man. They are probably right to continue to claim that \u2013 science for once supporting tradition. In their homeland at the dawn of the nation-state, the Vikings were rounded up and drowned at sea by the ancestors of today's Scandinavian weenies who love big government solutions and follow harm-based morality. Where they settled in Scotland, they intermarried and kept their genes flowing albeit at diluted levels. And even when they lost power, it was to other warrior types (Celtic, though, rather than Nordic) who bested them in battle, and who did not exterminate them after victory.\nThere was no powerful modern nation-state on the rise in the remote areas of Scotland, so there was no force there to carry out a cleansing of the coarser Medieval elements that a nice new nation-state would not want getting in the way of centralized power.\nThe Norsemen may have failed to secure a foothold in North America one-thousand years ago, but they may be vindicated yet with the election of the first Viking President.","title":"Donald Trump descended from Vikings?","media-type":"Blog","source":"Face to Face","published":"2015-09-03T17:37:22Z"}

Funded by individual donors and sponsors, the program provides members with blue jackets, which is part of FFA Official Dress. Members apply for a jacket by visiting FFA.org\/GIVEBLUE to share their story of what the jacket means to them. Along with an essay, members also share information on what they have been doing in FFA, their communities and in their schools. \n \n\u201cFor so many, the blue corduroy gives a sense of belonging,\u201d said Joshua Bledsoe, the chief operating officer for the National FFA Organization. \u201cThanks to this program, we are able to bring this sense of pride and belonging to more of our members, who are part of our FFA family.\u201d \n \nAlong with applying for a jacket, now others can nominate members they believe should be gifted a jacket. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve had so much success with the program,\u201d said Lee Anne Shiller, merchandise and membership services division director at national FFA. \u201cWe thought this would be a nice addition to the program and let others share stories of what our FFA members are accomplishing.\u201d \n \nThe funding for the program is thanks to corporate sponsors\u2014CSX Transportation, Valent U.S.A.

I felt, he's behaving like the heroes of Hollywood movies where they have hobbies like\u00a0carpentry, welding things, tree house building, white washing etc!!! Sounded incredible indeed. So yeah, a few of\u00a0his weekends were spent this ways...\nAfter he finished off the living room with 2 coats of white, before he could decide on the color, in one of the weekdays, I stood in the centre of the room and felt it was one big canvas and I had to do something on it. A wall art???\n2 options were in my mind - one going neutral with browns & beiges, another going colorful with bright multicolor. After breaking my head for something I headed to option 2.\u00a0\nFleur de Lis has always been my favourite icon, so I opted for it on one wall. With 4 bright colors of emulsion paint and after cutting up an OHP sheet to the pattern, I did this wall!\nOn the next wall, I wanted something else. A woman with flying hair was what came on my next wall. I call her a Medusa!!! Yeah, you're right. Medusa is freaky with snakes as hair. But doesn't every evil woman have an innocent and a seductress version of herself?!\u00a0So this is her innocent version...\u00a0\nHer hair is wavy and flying and is filled with all things nice - flowers, bows, butterflies, swallow birds, music notes, hearts, hibiscus, stars, and some dots & circles!!!\u00a0\nWhen 2 walls are so heavy and filled, I opted for something much much simpler in the other 2 walls. On a wall behind furnitures, at the joints, I opted for smaller, golden Fleur de Lis. Yet another wall, which has a window, I opted for the same multicolors, in just thin stripes along the window pane line.\u00a0\nThat's with the living room...

He said \u201cevery penny\u201d raised from the sale of the house would be ploughed back into affordable housing in the district. \n\nMeanwhile, Babergh councillor Bryn Hurren weighed into the debate describing the sale as \u201csocial cleansing\u201d. \n\nHe added: \u201cThere is a desperate need for normal people with low paid jobs to live in our villages. This house will become just another country mansion for the affluent.\u201d \n\nIn her letter, Mrs George questioned Babergh\u2019s reasons for selling the house and complained that local people had been kept in the dark about the proposal. She said: \u201cIt is astonishing this rural location is now regarded by Babergh as too remote for social housing tenants despite the fact the most recent local needs housing development is not far away in Wiston Road. This sets a worrying precedent.\u201d \n\nShe said Babergh officers had access to parish council documents about local needs. \n\n\u201cSo it is astonishing they did not involve the parish council in any way during the recent viability review of the Wiston house,\u201d she added. \n\nThe council\u2019s head of housing Martin King said the decision had been made after a rigorous assessment process and had been sanctioned by the council\u2019s joint housing board and strategy committee. \n\nHe said: \u201cThis is not about social cleansing but about making the most of the council\u2019s assets in terms of delivering suitable affordable housing. We look at the cost of bringing a property back into use, the projected 30-year cost and demand. \n\n\u201cIn this case, the cost was very high, there was no parking and you have to drive to get to local facilities. \n\n\u201cEvery penny raised from the sale of that property will go back into the fund we have for affordable housing which is one of our strategic priorities. However it might not be in Nayland, which already has an affordable housing scheme.\u201d \n\nMr King said lessons could be learned from this case, adding: \u201cIn the future, we need to be clear that we are keeping local members informed once the assessment process has been completed.\u201d","title":"A row has erupted after a council house in west Suffolk was put on the market without local councillors being informed.","media-type":"News","source":"East Anglian Daily Times","published":"2015-09-17T11:08:58Z"}

Watched the Sun embraces the Moon k-drama during the flight. \u00a0Best! I slept well despite sitting in the middle seat but\u00a020 minutes before the touchdown,\u00a0 we met with a thunderstorm.\nIt was a mild one I think, but enough to rock the plane for about 10 minutes.\nMau muntahhh pun ada..\nCold sweat juga la terumbang-ambing di udara. But thankfully there were\nno rain when we were nearing the airport. So it was another smooth landing despite the discomfort a few minutes ago. My first impression of the terminal from the plane was\n\"MACAM LCCT OOO\".. The arrival hall @ Chennai Airport Filling in the Immigration Form @ Chennai Airport Once i got inside the terminal, i saw that the building is in urgent need of maintenance. It has a feel of an old building left without being cared of.\nThe further i walked the more I felt like i was back to the 90s.\nI dunno..everything looks old. Looked abandoned pun ada.\nThat was not nice of me to say right? But I had the same feeling when i went to\u00a0Cambodia.\nIt feels like time stopped and the people\u00a0lives on in the 90s. And everything looks dull and grey. After filling on the immigration and customs form\u00a0 before passing the immigration\/customs checkpoint,\nwe went to the baggage claim area. The immigration process was quick.\nAnd i can see people bringing water and foods inside their bag. It's not airline food, but rather buns\/pastries from\u00a0 one of the bakeries in KLIA2. So the customs\/security was not really concerned about\u00a0 foods visitors bring in upon arrival. From my experience, i was never allowed to bring food past customs.\nBut it seems that they don't really bother about that here.\nIt's 5.30 Msia time and about 3am Indian time now. We are now at the hotel in Kancheepuram, a town about 2 hours away from Chennai.I really need to go to sleep but i want to finish this before i lost\u00a0 My momentum. .heheh\nOnce i stop, it might be abandoned as a draft haha. I remembered clearly as I stepped outside the airport building,\nI\u00a0immediately\u00a0reconfirmed the 90s feel once again.\nHaha.\nI noticed that everything seems to be a work in progress. I saw a wall splayed with grey cement inside the building just now\nand seems like it has been left like that for quite some time. Now i noticed that the pavement outside the building was also closed.\u00a0 Maybe for some repairing.\nBut seems to me it has also been abandoned for quite some time. On the way to our coaster,\u00a0I saw an auto.\nYou know, the 3 wheeled vehicle you see in Tamil movies.\nAnd i saw an old fashioned cab.\nMcm design 60s.\nHaha\nMrJ called me sakai.\nHaha sakai pun sakai la...\nMemang nda pernah\u00a0 nampak. It would be another 2 hours to the hotel which means we will\nArrive at 2am indian time.\nTime to take a nap. It was 3am Malaysian time and i was starting to\nFeel drowsy. At 2am when we finally reached the hotel,\nI feel drowsier no thanks to the nap.\nThe road to the hotel was small and the coaster was too big to drive through it. So it literally stopped in the middle of the road\u00a0 for us to disembark much to the annoyance of the\nlorry driver at the back.\nHe was honking like crazy.\nI walked hurriedly so i would not see them bickering. I need to sleep now.\nI'll talk about the hotel next ok.\nGood night.\nSigning off 5.46am Msian time.That's 3.15am indian time. Tomorrow, the adventure starts at 9am. Signing off. Next post preview : The hotel room in Kancheepuram. author's note : This post was supposed to be posted at the hotel after we get the wi-fi password. \u00a0But, there were no wi-fi. \u00a0So, hari ni baru dapat post. \u00a08 days after the India Trip officially ended.","title":"India trip : the departures and the arrival","media-type":"Blog","source":"ViCaPrincess","published":"2015-09-09T23:58:38Z"}

{"id":"b618b9b6-de0d-4bd5-b318-6a4ce52b19ff","content":"In \"Politicians Seeing Evil, Hearing Evil, Speaking Evil\" TMOW says that a\u00a0new film about Yitzhak Rabin\u2019s 1995 assassination in Israel could serve as a warning about Donald Trump and Ben Carson\u2019s divisive, bigoted campaigns. \u00a0Mr. Bruni considers \"Scott Walker's Cocktail of Ignorance\" and says too\u00a0many Republican candidates are too cavalier about the knowledge and preparation that a president should have. \u00a0Here's TMOW:\n\nThere is a movie I\u2019m looking forward to seeing when it comes to Washington. It seems quite relevant to America today. It\u2019s about what can happen in a democratic society when politicians go too far, when they not only stand mute when hateful words that cross civilized redlines suddenly become part of the public discourse, but, worse, start to wink at and dabble in this hate speech for their advantage.\nLater, they all say that they never heard the words, never saw the signs, or claim that their own words were misunderstood. But they heard and they saw and they meant. Actually, I don\u2019t need to see the movie, because I lived it. And I know how it ends. Somebody gets hurt.\nThe movie is called \u201cRabin: The Last Day.\u201d Agence France-Presse said the movie, by the renowned Israeli director Amos Gitai, is about \u201cthe incitement campaign before the 1995 assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin\u201d and \u201crevisits a form of Jewish radicalism that still poses major risks.\u201d This is the 20th anniversary of Rabin\u2019s assassination by Yigal Amir, a right-wing Jewish radical.\n\u201cMy goal wasn\u2019t to create a personality cult around Rabin,\u201d Gitai told A.F.P. \u201cMy focus was on the incitement campaign that led to his murder.\u201d Sure, the official investigating commission focused on the breakdowns in Rabin\u2019s security detail, but, Gitai added, \u201cThey didn\u2019t investigate what were the underlying forces that wanted to kill Rabin. His murder came at the end of a hate campaign led by hallucinating rabbis, settlers who were against the withdrawal from territories and the parliamentary right, led by the Likud (party), already then headed by Benjamin Netanyahu, who wanted to destabilize Rabin\u2019s Labor government.\u201d\nThe film, A.F.P. said, \u201crelied on documents, photos and videos, particularly from the months before Rabin\u2019s assassination, including those showing speeches from politicians such as Netanyahu at rallies against the Oslo accords, where Rabin was depicted in a Nazi uniform.\u201d\nI hope a lot of Americans see this film \u2014 for the warning it offers to those who ignore or rationalize the divisive, bigoted campaigns of Donald Trump and Ben Carson and how they\u2019re dragging their whole party across civic redlines, with candidates saying, rationalizing or ignoring more and more crazy, ill-informed stuff each week.\nTrump actually launched his campaign on June 16 with a message of polarization, saying: \u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. \u2026 They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker column gave him four Pinocchios, its highest rating for not telling the truth, noting: \u201cTrump\u2019s repeated statements about immigrants and crime underscore a common public perception that crime is correlated with immigration, especially illegal immigration. But that is a misperception; no solid data support it, and the data that do exist negate it.\u201d\nAnd then Trump insulted John McCain, saying he was only a war hero because he got captured, adding, \u201cI like people that weren\u2019t captured, O.K.?\u201d McCain spent five and a half years as a P.O.W. in Vietnam and was repeatedly tortured and had his bones broken. As CNN reported, \u201cTrump, meanwhile, received four student deferments and one medical deferment to avoid serving in the Vietnam War.\u201d\nWhat does it mean to impugn a man who has sacrificed so much for his country? It means you can smear anyone.\nLast week another redline was crossed. At a Trump town hall event, the first questioner began: \u201cWe got a problem in this country. It\u2019s called Muslims. We know our current president is one. We know he\u2019s not even an American. But anyway. We have training camps brewing where they want to kill us. That\u2019s my question. When can we get rid of them?\u201d\nTrump responded: \u201cA lot of people are saying that bad things are happening out there. We\u2019re going to be looking into that and plenty of other things.\u201d\nTrump could have let the man ask his question and then correct his racist nonsense, without blocking his free speech, which is exactly what McCain did in a similar situation. Instead, he later said it was not his place to defend Obama. As someone who aspires to be president it is his place to defend the truth, but since Trump himself has been the source of so much birther nonsense about Obama, I guess that would be hard. Instead he tweeted: \u201cChristians need support in our country (and around the world), their religious liberty is at stake! Obama has been horrible, I will be great.\u201d\nAnd then, like clockwork, Ben Carson saw Trump blurring another civic redline and leapfrogged him. Carson stated, \u201cI would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation.\u201d\nSo a whole faith community gets delegitimized and another opportunity for someone to courageously stand up for what\u2019s decent is squandered. But it will play well with certain voters. And that is all that matters \u2014 until something really bad happens. And then, all of it \u2014 the words, tweets, signs and boasts \u2014 will be footage for another documentary that ends badly.\n\nAnd now here's Mr. Bruni:\n\n\nWith the arrival of the pope, our spirits lift.\nWith the departure of Scott Walker, they plummet.\nThere\u2019s so much we\u2019ll never know, such as how far he was willing to take his single issue. For Walker it was unions at dawn, unions at dusk, unions in his dreams. Having hobbled them in Wisconsin, he vowed to cripple them nationally, and who\u2019s to say it would have stopped there? I feel certain that he was mere weeks away from a big speech advocating the deployment of ground troops to stamp out collective bargaining among the Sherpas in Nepal.\nI feel certain, too, that his best gaffes were still to come, though he gave us several gems. In an era lacking visionary leadership, he envisioned a great wall along our northern border to keep out the tides of Canadians fleeing the tyranny of free health insurance. And we learned that years back, he mangled an intended \u201cmazel tov\u201d in a letter to a Jewish constituent, instead writing: \u201cThank you again and Molotov.\u201d\nI miss him already. And I wonder: Was it his shallowness that undid him? Just how little learning will Republican voters abide in a candidate? Did he test the limit?\nOne of his former aides, Liz Mair, suggested as much, firing off tweets on Monday about his errors, including \u201cnot educating himself fast enough\u201d on national and world affairs.\nWalker evaded foreign policy questions, apparently petrified of being tripped up. He bungled domestic policy questions, seemingly unable to cling to a sturdy position.\nBut whether that doomed him is impossible to say in a Republican primary season with mixed messages about the party\u2019s appetite for ignorance, at once prodigious and inconsistent.\nDonald Trump has prospered, and he\u2019s utterly unapologetic about all of the matters that he hasn\u2019t taken the trouble to bone up on and all of the experts whom he hasn\u2019t bothered to consult.\nWhen NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd asked him where he gets his military advice, he said: \u201cI watch the shows.\u201d He presumably meant \u201cMeet the Press\u201d and \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d though I don\u2019t think we can rule out \u201cSurvivor\u201d or \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\nTime and again, Trump pledges to amass the proper information just before he needs it \u2014 no point in doing so now, before he finds out if he\u2019s hired \u2014 and he predicts that he\u2019ll shame everyone then with his abracadabra erudition. He\u2019s a procrastinating college freshman planning an all-nighter before the final exam.\nBut here comes Carly Fiorina, and her brand is aced-it-already and know-it-all. I\u2019ve seen this firsthand.\nFor a magazine story in 2010, I followed her around and interviewed her over several days. Someone would mention a flower; she\u2019d rattle off a factoid about it. I\u2019d ask her about a foreign language that she\u2019d studied; she\u2019d make clear that she\u2019d dabbled in two others as well. Her husband would tell a story; she\u2019d rush to correct him and fill in the details.\nHer fresh bounce in the polls reflects a debate performance last week that was all about policy fluency, and Marco Rubio, who flaunted similar chops that night, also seemed to benefit from his show of smarts.\nSo do Republicans want finesse or fire? A cool intellect or a hothead?\nWalker was no doubt as confused about this as he is about so much else, and no wonder. Well beyond the Republican primary and the Republican Party, we\u2019ve exhibited a curious habit in this country of forgiving intellectual blind spots and refashioning a contempt for schooling as an embrace of common sense.\nA whole subgenre of nonfiction is devoted to this.

And I\u2019m not rejecting the importance of instinct.\nBut I\u2019m weary and wary of politicians whose ambitions precede and eclipse any serious, necessary preparation for the office they seek. Walker is a perfect example.\nI kept hearing and reading \u2014 after he\u2019d obviously decided to run for president \u2014 that he was being briefed by an emergency crew of wonks. Shouldn\u2019t that have happened first? Shouldn\u2019t he have been paying attention all along, out of a genuine interest in this sort of material rather than a pragmatic one?\nHe wasn\u2019t, and so this candidate \u2014 who had begun gaming out his political future all the way back in college, where he gave his classes short shrift \u2014 took an international trip during which he refused to discuss international relations, oddly claiming that it wouldn\u2019t be polite.\nEtiquette prevailed.\nHe didn\u2019t.\nMolotov, Governor Walker.","title":"Friedman and Bruni","media-type":"Blog","source":"Marion in Savannah","published":"2015-09-23T14:13:11Z"}

Ceresney, Director of the SEC\u2019s Enforcement Division.\u00a0 \u201cHitachi then unlawfully mischaracterized those payments in its books and records as consulting fees and other legitimate payments.\u201d \n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia: \nHitachi was aware that Chancellor House Holdings (Pty) Ltd. was a funding vehicle for the ANC during the bidding process.\u00a0 Hitachi nevertheless continued to partner with Chancellor and encourage the company to use its political influence to help obtain government contracts from Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., a public utility owned and operated by the South African government. Hitachi paid \u201csuccess fees\u201d to Chancellor for its exertion of influence during the Eskom tender process pursuant to a separate, unsigned side-arrangement.\u00a0 \nHitachi\u2019s misconduct violated the books and records and internal accounting controls provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\u00a0 \n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Hitachi agreed to a settlement that would require the company to pay a $19 million penalty, and it would be permanently enjoined from future violations.\u00a0 The settlement is subject to court approval.\u00a0 \n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Jon Jordan and Thierry Olivier Desmet of the FCPA Unit in Miami with assistance from Kathleen Strandell, David S. Johnson, and Matthew P. Cohen.\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Justice Department\u2019s Fraud Section, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Integrity and Anti-Corruption Department of the African Development Bank, and the South African Financial Services Board. \n\n\u201cWe particularly appreciate the assistance we received from the African Development Bank\u2019s Integrity and Anti-Corruption Department and hope this is the first in a series of collaborations,\u201d said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division\u2019s FCPA Unit. \u00a0","title":"SEC Charges Hitachi With FCPA Violations","media-type":"News","source":"Newsfile","published":"2015-09-28T15:36:00Z"}

The initiative, which provides neighbourhood drop-in centres for the over 65s, was first launched in Papakura (South Auckland) in 2000.  Since then, the number of Selwyn Centres has grown to 43, offering friendship, fun, support and advocacy to seniors in localities across Greater Auckland, Northland, the Waikato and Christchurch. \n \nFor older people who may be without close family or friends, or who have limited opportunity for social engagement, the Selwyn Centres provide a chance to meet up each week with others of the same age group within their local area.  Part-funded by The Selwyn Foundation, a charitable Trust whose mission is to help vulnerable elderly, they are run in partnership with Anglican Church parishes and welcome people of all faiths, backgrounds, cultures and ethnicities. \n \nLoneliness is one of the most challenging issues facing elderly people today, but the thriving Selwyn Centres Parish Partnership programme provides invaluable social interaction and companionship to those who may be lonely or socially isolated.  Based mainly in Anglican Church halls, they offer a timetable of shared activities, gentle exercise, morning tea and occasional trips and excursions all at nominal cost, with transport available, if required. Each session is facilitated by a trained coordinator and a team of volunteers. \n \nThe Selwyn Foundation invests significant funding in the Selwyn Centre programme each year, and is committed to further expanding the network of Centres.  Commenting on the need for such a service, the Foundation\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Garry Smith, says: \n \n\u201cLoneliness can be a serious health issue for older people, but the opportunity to meet others on a regular basis, form new friendships and generally be part of a community-based group at a local Selwyn Centre helps address this problem.  It can also reduce the risk of cognitive decline and other adverse health conditions that can develop as a result of having limited social contact. \n \n\u201cResearch confirms that, if you\u2019re older and you\u2019re lonely, the chances are that your mental faculties may decline at a quicker rate.  However, remaining socially connected has a positive effect on general health and can also bring psychological benefits, such as delaying the onset of dementia.  Indeed, the importance of social connections for wellbeing has led researchers to call on health professionals to take loneliness as seriously as other health risks (such as obesity and smoking). \n \n\u201cThe Selwyn Centres provide companionship and shared interests in a supportive environment which, in turn, can contribute to older people being able to stay active, healthy and independent in their own homes.\u201d \n \nAcknowledging the value of the Selwyn Centre model and the psychological and health benefits that it promotes, the Counties Manukau District Health Board contributes funding each year to support the programme in South Auckland. \n \nTo celebrate the opening of the first ever Selwyn Centre at the Selwyn Homestead in Papakura, a special anniversary event was attended by a number of the original guests, as well as coordinators, volunteers and Parish Committee members of the Papakura Anglican Church who, with the Foundation, were instrumental in establishing the Centre 15 years ago. \n \nA directory of all the Selwyn Centre locations is available at www.selwyncare.org.nz . \n \nENDS \nContent Sourced from scoop.co.nz \n Original url","title":"The Selwyn Foundation celebrates 15 years of Selwyn Centres","media-type":"Blog","source":"auckland.scoop.co.nz","published":"2015-09-28T14:23:53Z"}

At first glance, Gabrial is a handicapper against a proven Group One horse in Elm Park, for all that Richard Fahey\u2019s runner managed to finish third in the Sussex Stakes earlier in the season. He is much more exposed than Elm Park too, having lined up 11 times already this season, comfortably more than Elm Park has managed in his entire career. What the market remembers is that he won the Lincoln Handicap back in March and has not managed a victory since. What it tends to forget is that the runner-up at Doncaster was Mondialiste, a recent Group One winner in Canada for David O\u2019Meara, and that Gabrial has run with impressive consistency in a series of Pattern events. Elm Park is the obvious favourite, and a worthy one as well on the balance of his form which includes victory in last season\u2019s Racing Post Trophy, but odds-on quotes are much too short for a horse with something to prove after two defeats as a three-year-old. Timeform, in fact, reckon Gabrial has only 1lb to find with Andrew Balding\u2019s runner at today\u2019s weights, so a price of 9-2 versus the 4-5 about Elm Park simply looks wrong. Postbag (3.55) improved when touched off by Rosalie Bonheur at Windsor last time. She is 1lb better off and has more scope for further progress that the winner, who re-opposes today. Hound Music (5.00) is a fair price at around 8-1 for the concluding handicap, while Critical Risk (3.30) and Flying Hammer (4.00) are the pick of a useful card at Yarmouth. Tipping competition, day three Our winners so far: Monday Spending Time 9-2 Great Expectations 12-1 Perfect Pastime 9-1 Tuesday Willsy 100-30 Scoreline 9-1 Star Ascending 12-1 And our leader is \u2026 TheVic +12.50 \u2026 who had the 12-1 shot Star Ascending yesterday.

O'Dwyer ticks both boxes but shrugs off the \"moderate\" tag.\n\n\"I would describe myself as being a Liberal \u2026 I take a slightly dryer perspective on economics and I'm probably a bit more socially progressive.\"\n\nO'Dywer is the first woman to be appointed to cabinet in an economic role. She takes on a turbo-charged combined portfolio of Assistant Treasurer and Small Business, previously held by Josh Frydenberg and Bruce Billson.\n\nThe dual roles are a natural fit given her personal and professional background. \"I'm very passionate about small business, I come from a family that has been steeped in small business,\" she says.\n\nHer grandparents Gwen and Alec Dixon began the first of their businesses making and selling felt ties. This venture morphed into a milk bar and then a grocery store. O'Dwyer says her grandparents reflect the \"entrepreneurial spirit\" that she says is \"at the heart of Australia.\" \"That's part of the great Australian story.\"\n\n\"I really respect dynamic, entrepreneurial people who are prepared to take a risk and employ people,\" she said.\n\nIn announcing her appointment to cabinet, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said that \"in effect\" she was \"the minister for revenue\" and \"responsible for the tax system\". But Treasurer Scott Morrison insists the budget has a spending and not a revenue problem.\n\nSo what is O'Dwyer's job? She agrees with the Treasurer's priority of getting spending well below the current historic highs of 26 per cent of GDP. Any more debt, she says, will simply \"cannibalise\" the budget and \"starve\" the government of being able to deliver services.\n\n\"We want a strong safety net and that is what a strong economy can deliver.\"\n\n\"We as a government want to be nimble, we want to focus on innovation and get the economic settings right that encourage more aspiration and opportunity.\"\n\nHow? \"We're only day five,\" she says refusing to give any indication of how the government might alter the tax mix. Her previous writings as one of the Coalition's \"Modest Members\" are more forthcoming and have argued for fewer taxes, collecting less tax revenue overall and improving the way the tax and benefits system interact so people are not penalised for working harder.\n\nO'Dwyer chaired the House of Representatives Economics Committee; a prestigious position given it regularly hauls before it the Reserve Bank Governor.\n\nBefore she entered the Parliament in 2009 in the Higgins by-election she was a solicitor at Freehills and a NAB executive. But anyone performing a quick Google of her name would be forgiven for thinking her only past job is serving as an advisor to former Treasurer Peter Costello.\n\n\"Former Costello staffer wins Higgins preselection\" and \"Costello staffer wins seat\" are just two of the headlines heralding her political successes.\n\nO'Dwyer will be out to put her own stamp on the Coalition's new economic direction.\n\n\"I think it's fair to say Peter Costello is the most formidable Treasurer this country has seen,\" O'Dwyer said.\n\n\"To be able to call him a friend and a mentor is fantastic and he's certainly someone I will turn to for counsel,\" she said.\n\n\"But I will own my own decisions and I will be responsible for my own performance and people will judge me accordingly,\" she said.\n\nFollow us on Twitter\n\nFollow Latika Bourke on","title":"Four jobs at once: Kelly O'Dwyer's first interview since joining cabinet","media-type":"News","source":"Southern Weekly","published":"2015-09-25T06:15:36Z"}

In fact, both have seen a huge jump in line losses. \n\nIn Varanasi, the line loss has gone up from 43.18 per cent to 50.13 per cent while in Azamagarh, it has risen from 56.84 per cent to 63.78 per cent. \n\nDespite the government's best efforts, the overall line losses in the state have increased from 42.12 per cent to 42.74 per cent, as per an internal assessment report of the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL). \n\nBanda, in Bundelkhand, tops the chart in terms of increase in line losses -from 40.91 per cent to 51.89 per cent. According to a standard benchmark set by the central government in its power reform proposals, the line loss should not go beyond 15 per cent of total transmission. \n\nLikewise, the state capital, Lucknow, which is represented by Union home minister Rajnath Singh, has registered an increase in cases of power theft from 36.33 per cent to 41.06 per cent. \n\nAlarmingly , even Noida, which is known for honest power consumers, has shown an increase in instances of power theft from 10.03 per cent in 2014 to 11.87 per cent in 2015. \n\nNeighbouring Ghaziabad too has registered an increase in power theft from 34.43 per cent to 35.79 per cent within a year. \n\nIn Gorakhpur, the theft has gone up from 42.87 per cent to 50.61 per cent within a year. In Meerut, line losses increased from 34.03 per cent to 42.8 per cent. \n\nBut cities like Gonda and Mirzapur have shown a remarkable decrease in power theft from 56.15 per cent to 36.23 per cent and 51.33 per cent to 36.67 per cent. \n\nThe problem has been marginally improved in cities like Moradabad, Saharanpur, Agra and Aligarh where line losses have lessened by around 1 per cent. \n\nThe problem of power theft, not surprisingly , stands in sharp contrast with the government's plans to in crease power supply in districts which register less than 15 per cent line losses by October 1. \n\nChief secretary Alok Ranjan had last week asked the Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd to ensure an increased power supply in districts which show consistent improvement in line losses. \n\nThe Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission, too, had taken strong exception to the instances of power theft while deciding to hold officials concerned personally responsible. \n\nPrincipal secretary Sanjay Agarwal said the situation was being watched closely. \"The corporation will take strict measures in districts which have registered an increase in line losses,\" the principal secretary said.","title":"PM Narendra Modi, SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav turfs top UP power-theft list","media-type":"News","source":"Economic Times","published":"2015-09-29T05:24:43Z"}

His space company, Blue Origin, looks to be setting up a new space race with Elon Musk's SpaceX. by Eric Mack @ericcmack September 15, 2015 12:08 PM PDT Updated: September 15, 2015 12:49 PM PDT Bezos: Super space nerd. Blue Origin Long before he was conjuring up ways to sell us everything from a basketball hoop to tiny parts to fix our ceiling fans, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was a space nut.\nTuesday morning at Florida's Cape Canaveral Spaceport, Bezos' space technology company Blue Origin announced plans to set up shop on the historic Space Coast, where missions like Mariner first infected a young Bezos with the space bug decades ago. Bezos told a small crowd of press and dignitaries at Cape Canaveral that Blue Origin will be taking over the launch site at Complex 36, where 145 launches including the Mariner missions, Pioneer 10 and Surveyor 1 lifted off over the decades.\n7 Photos SpaceX, NASA dream of selling dream trips (pictures) \"The site saw its last launch in 2005 and the pad has stood silent for more than 10 years -- too long. We can't wait to fix that,\" Bezos said, adding that Blue Origin will also open a rocket production center at the Spaceport to streamline the process from manufacture to launch. With true Amazonian efficiency, Bezos made the announcement in a brief five-paragraph speech before surrendering the microphone to local politicians who droned on about economic development for the next 40 minutes.\nEven before Amazon had its first profitable year, Bezos was throwing money into Blue Origin as far back as its founding in 2000. Since then, Blue Origin has been developing rocket engines and capsules for both orbital and suborbital flight. It's currently taking reservations for space tourists. The company hasn't garnered as much mainstream attention as Tesla CEO Elon Musk's SpaceX, perhaps because we've been too busy focusing more on Amazon's drone efforts, or Bezos' successful but unrelated effort to recover an old Apollo 11 rocket from the Atlantic (OK, OK, Jeff, your space nut bona fides are confirmed, we get it).\nRelated stories Jeff Bezos IDs recovered Apollo 11 rocket Bezos' space company tests suborbital rocket To the casual observer, it looks as though Bezos and Blue Origin are positioned to give Musk and SpaceX a big run for their money following this news, the explosion earlier this year of a SpaceX rocket bound for the International Space Station and Blue Origin's partnership with United Launch Alliance (itself a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin) to supply the engine for ULA's first super-powerful, reusable Vulcan rocket. At the end of the press event, Bezos again took the mic to reveal a preview glamour shot of Blue Origin's orbital vehicle that will use the company's BE-4 engine, which is currently being designed, to carry people into space, likely for larger-scale industrial, defense or NASA missions. Its \"little brother,\" the BE-3, was successfully used to test launch the company's \"New Shepard\" suborbital spacecraft in April.\n\"One day -- I don't know how long this will take -- but one day I look forward to having a press conference in space,\" Bezos told the crowd in closing.

It certainly gained one in Jimmy Smothers. \n  \nThe legendary sports editor of The Gadsden Times died Monday at the age of 82. He was a mentor to many sportswriters across this state, including myself. \n \nMy earliest memories of meeting Jimmy came during my college days at Jacksonville State University. I was a sportswriter for the school newspaper, The Chanticleer, and I came into contact with Jimmy quite often at football and basketball games. He was a staple at many Gamecock sporting events. \n \nThe thing I noticed about Jimmy that was so special was what I call the human touch. He always had a smile on his face when talking to someone, and that made people who didn\u2019t know him feel at ease around him. He made them feel like a friend, and that\u2019s something I\u2019ve tried to emulate throughout my career. \n \nAs my college years passed by and I was close to graduating, I became an intern at Jacksonville State University Sports Information. One day, JSU Sports Information Director Greg Seitz called me into his office and told me Jimmy had inquired about me, wanting to know if I would be interested in what he called a \u201cfull-time, part-time position.\u201d I told him I was interested, so Greg, Jimmy, and I worked it out to where I would go to class in the mornings, work at JSU in the afternoon, and then I\u2019d go to Gadsden to work a couple of nights a week. \n \nIt meant a lot to me that Jimmy felt like I\u2019d be an asset to The Times\u2019 sports staff. Here was a beloved sports writing legend who took the time to make a young, aspiring sports writer feel as if he was on his level. \n \nNever in my wildest dreams did I expect the opportunity Jimmy gave me. He didn\u2019t just give me a token desk job answering phone calls. He treated me as if I was one of his own. \n \nThere were a couple of occasions where I even got to travel with him to cover Alabama and Auburn college football games. Truth be told, I was scared to death on those trips because I was hoping I would make him proud. \n \nLooking back now, those are some of the greatest memories in my career that I have. I really got to see him in action, and I got a first-hand account of how well respected and thought of he was by so many on a statewide level. \n \nThe many gifts Jimmy imparted on me carried over to my first \u201cofficial\u201d sports writing job as the prep sports editor at The Anniston Star, and now as sports editor here at The Herald. When I learned of his passing Tuesday morning, I was heartbroken. I knew his health had been fading over the past several years, but even so, he still continued doing what he loved. \n \nHis last column was published on Sunday. \n \nI think all of my colleagues who knew Jimmy on a personal level would say this. The greatest gift he imparted upon all of us in this profession was it\u2019s not so much about the events you\u2019re covering as much as it is about the people who are involved with them. That\u2019s what makes a great story. \n \nWithout a doubt, Heaven truly gained a great storyteller.","title":"SHANNON FAGAN: Smothers a great friend, mentor, and storyteller","media-type":"News","source":"Cherokee County Herald","published":"2015-09-01T17:12:00Z"}

{"id":"bde6cdf6-5e8e-400d-9f45-bd9350c24b65","content":"(Reuters Health) \u2013 When patients are hospitalized more than once in the same month, it may have more to do with their income or education levels than the quality of care they received, a U.S. study suggests. \n \n \n \n \nPerhaps unsurprisingly, patients 85 and older are more likely to return to the hospital within 30 days of being sent home than people a decade or two younger, according to the analysis of data from Medicare, the U.S. health program for the elderly and disabled. \n \n \n \nBut patients also have higher odds of returning soon after discharge if they lack a high school diploma, have limited income and assets or have health benefits from Medicaid, the U.S. health program for the poor. \n \n \n \nThe findings suggest that Medicare penalties for what\u2019s known as readmissions under the Affordable Care Act may in some instances mete out punishment for outcomes that are beyond doctors\u2019 control, said lead study author Dr. Michael Barnett and senior author Dr. Michael McWilliams, colleagues at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. \n \n \n \n\u201cHospitals are being penalized to a large extent based on the patients they serve,\u201d the doctors said by email. \u201cPatients admitted to hospitals with higher readmission rates are sicker and more socially disadvantaged in a variety of ways than patients admitted to hospitals with lower readmission rates.\u201d \n \n \n \nUnder the current penalty system, Medicare deducts 3 percent from inpatient payments to hospitals with higher than expected readmission rates, the researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine. Expected rates are only adjusted for patients\u2019 age, sex and recent diagnoses including the one from their hospital stay. \n \n\n \n  \n \nIn 2014, the second year of the program, about 2,600 hospitals were fined a combined $428 million for excessive readmissions, the authors report. \n \n \n \nTo get a better understanding of how individual patient characteristics might influence repeat hospitalizations, the researchers examined several other variables Medicare doesn\u2019t consider in determining expected readmission rates \u2013 such as education and income levels, marital status, employment, race and ethnicity, smoking status and drinking habits. \n \n \n \nThey linked records from a nationwide health and retirement survey of Americans over 50 collected between 2000 and 2010 to data from Medicare claims from 2000 to 2012. The combined analysis assessed more than 8,000 hospital admissions. \n \n\n \n  \n \nThe researchers sorted hospitals into quintiles based on readmission rates. They found that at least half of the observed difference in the probability of repeat hospitalizations between hospitals with the highest and lowest readmission rates might be accounted for by patient characteristics not currently considered by Medicare. \n \n \n \nWhen researchers only used Medicare\u2019s criteria comparing readmission rates, they found the probability of repeat hospitalization was about 15 percent at facilities with the lowest rates and about 19.5 percent at hospitals with the highest rates. \n \n \n \nBut when they took another look using more criteria on patients\u2019 medical, social and economic characteristics, the gap between hospitals with the lowest and the highest readmission rates narrowed to 16 percent and 18.4 percent, respectively, odds of repeat hospitalization. \n \n\n \n  \n \nOne limitation of the study, the authors acknowledge, is the data didn\u2019t allow them to calculate how considering individual patient characteristics might impact readmission rates at specific hospitals. \n \n \n \nEven so, the findings suggest that the current Medicare penalty system for repeat hospitalizations may put facilities serving poor communities at a distinct financial disadvantage, Dr. Carl van Walraven, a senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in Canada, noted in an accompanying editorial. \n \n \n \n\u201cDifferences between hospitals in readmissions may be due to who is treated rather than how they\u2019re treated,\u201d van Walraven said by email. \n \n \n \n \n\n \nSOURCE: bit.ly\/1MmPcWX and bit.ly\/1UT2grE JAMA Internal Medicine, online September 14, 2","title":"Poverty may increase odds of repeat hospitalizations","media-type":"News","source":"HealthMediciNet.com","published":"2015-09-15T23:24:49Z"}

Ltd., Osaka Gas Co. Ltd., Japan Tobacco Inc.,Toyota Motor Corp., Denso Corp., Toyota Industries Corp., East Japan Railway Co., Central Japan Railway Co., Seven & i Holdings Co. Ltd., and FUJIFILMHoldings Corp. We have also affirmed our ratings on Toyota Motor's domesticand overseas subsidiaries and Seven & i's domestic and overseas operatingsubsidiaries (see list below). We have affirmed our issue credit ratings onthose companies that have issued instruments such as long-term senior debt and\n\ncommercial paper. These rating actions follow our downgrade of the sovereignrating on Japan to 'A+\/Stable\/A-1' on Sept. 16, 2015. The outlooks on thelong-term corporate credit ratings on the companies remain stable.\n\nThe long-term corporate credit ratings on the 13 companies are either 'AA' or'AA-', thus exceeding the long-term sovereign credit rating. Under ourcriteria, if the sovereign rating is 'B' or higher, an entity can be ratedabove the sovereign rating if, in our view, there is an appreciable likelihoodthat it would not default if the sovereign were to default. The entity can berated up to two or up to four notches above the sovereign rating, depending onthe sensitivity of the entity's sector to country risk (see \"Ratings Above TheSovereign--Corporate And Government Ratings: Methodology And Assumptions,\"published Nov. 19, 2013). Because we lowered the long-term sovereign rating onJapan to 'A+', we applied a stress test on the 13 companies to verify whetherour ratings on them can exceed the sovereign. The stress test incorporates ourassumptions including reduced revenues and earnings resulting from severe\n\nmacroeconomic stress, a haircut to holdings of domestic marketable securities,a sharp increase in funding costs because of an assumed rise in interestrates, and lack of capital market access for refinancing. The companies passedthe stress test because they each have very high credit quality based onstrong businesses and sound financial standing. Accordingly, we havedetermined that our ratings on the 13 companies can exceed our sovereignrating on Japan.\n\nWe view the regulated gas utility industry and the railway industry as having\"high\" sensitivity to country risk, indicating they are highly sensitive to acombination of economic volatility and potential changes in legal andregulatory environments. Therefore, the maximum number of notches by which ourratings on Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas, East Japan Railway, and Central Japan Railwaycan exceed the sovereign rating is likely to be fewer than for othercompanies.","title":"Ratings On 13 Japanese Industrial Companies Affirmed After Sovereign Outlooks","media-type":"News","source":"Newswit.com","published":"2015-09-17T10:10:11Z"}

Now we need to see proper planning and funding so that this policy doesn't fall short of its excellent intentions. Taking the first steps into a school environment is the most important stage of a child's education.\" \n \nExtending free childcare was promised by the Conservatives in their manifesto, but questions have been raised about how it would be delivered. \n \nThe scheme is planned to start from September 2016 and be fully implemented by September 2017. \n \nThe Tories originally said the plan would cost \u00a3350 million a year, but Employment Minister Priti Patel has been appointed to chair a review of childcare funding, which she expects to deliver an ''uplift'' to the hourly rate paid by the Government. \n \nThe Pre-School Learning Alliance, which represents 14,000 private, voluntary and independent groups, has previously warned the existing 15 hours a week of free childcare is ''grossly underfunded'' by the Government. \n \nResponding to the report, its chief executive Neil Leitch said: \"These findings clearly reinforce the concerns raised by the private and voluntary childcare sector about the potential impact of the 30 hours offer. \n \n\"The early years sector has been significantly underfunded for many years, forcing providers to find other ways to cover the cost of providing places. \n \n\"It's vital that government resists the temptation to rush out a policy that, while attractive on the surface, is simply unworkable in its current form.\" \n \nA Department for Education spokeswoman said:  \"We know that childcare is one of the biggest issues affecting parents. This is why we are working closely with the sector to deliver 30 hours of free childcare, and innovative childcare providers are being asked to come forward as the first in the country to deliver it from September 2016. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n\"We have already committed to raising the average hourly rate providers receive, and are also undertaking a review of childcare costs to inform a new rate that is fair for providers and delivers value for money for the taxpayer.\"","title":"New childcare laws 'may lead to nurseries taking in fewer children'","media-type":"News","source":"Gazette And Observer","published":"2015-09-07T23:13:46Z"}

Officers fired their weapons, the chief said, but it's not clear if the homeowner had a gun. \n \nAlexander said his department would typically handle the investigation since it did not involve a fatality, but because of the unusual situation, he asked the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to look into it. \n \n\"We did respond to the wrong residence tonight and then these other circumstances unfolded,\" he said. \n \nAlexander said the situation happened like this: A neighborhood resident called 911 at 7:34 p.m. to report a suspicious person and described a home to the dispatcher. Three officers responded to a house that fit the description the caller gave 911. The officers went to the back of the home and found that a screen door and a rear door were unlocked. \n \n\"That in and of itself would probably suggest to anyone that it is possible that there could be intruders inside, but it turned out not to be the case,\" Alexander said. \"Somewhere at the rear of that home, some things happened that have yet to be determined.\" \n \nThe officers had just entered the home when the gunfire erupted. \n \n\"There was gunfire, I just cannot tell you who fired and who did not,\" he said. \n \nAn officer was shot in the leg and lost a lot of blood. He was rushed to the hospital and was undergoing surgery. The homeowner was also taken to the hospital. \n \nThe homeowner's girlfriend was at the home at the time of the shooting and called 911. \n \nDerek Perez told The Associated Press that he reported the suspicious person. He said he was walking his dog when he saw a man knock on a neighbor's door and then just stand in the yard. He said he then heard a loud noise, a dog barking and didn't see the man anymore. There had been break-ins in the neighborhood recently, so he called 911, he said. \n \nJust as he was about to go into his house, he heard the gunshots, but they didn't come from the house where he had reported the suspicious person. \n \nPolice were still investigating whether there was a burglary at the home where the suspicious person was spotted. \n \nAll three officers have been placed on administrative leave. \n \nThe shooting happened in a neighborhood about 5 miles from downtown Atlanta.","title":"'Complicated shooting' injures Georgia police officer, homeowner","media-type":"News","source":"Birmingham News","published":"2015-09-01T11:40:49Z"}

The stock gained nearly 9% on the news, extending its rally off the Aug. 24 spike low to more than 30%. Volume driving this huge breakout reached its heaviest level in a year. \n\nThis very bullish action appears to have quickly lost its momentum as a new week begins. Nike is leaving behind an ugly spike high and will likely drift lower in the near term. For patient bulls, this will present a low-risk entry opportunity. \n  Nike opened Friday with a powerful upside gap after investors aggressively bid up shares Thursday night. The stock easily cleared heavy resistance near the $117 area in the process. Nike had topped just below $118 last month and was stalling just above $117 last week as earnings loomed. This area now forms the upper band of support. Just below is the Friday morning gap at $115.15 which marks the bottom of this major support zone. \nFor bullish Nike investors, a retest of this area will provide a very low-risk buying opportunity. Investors should focus on the $118-to-$117 area for new purchases. A continued drift on lighter trade down to this zone in the next few weeks should spark action. \n\nClick here to see the below chart in a new window.","title":"Nike Is Drifting Toward Lower Entry Points","media-type":"News","source":"AdvisorSource.com","published":"2015-09-28T18:26:00Z"}

Thus began a detailed preparation with MI Airline , makers of the AirFi product, which also makes a cabin management system called Connected Crew. Also involved was the airline caterer Newrest where the AirFi boxes are stored, charged and uploaded. \n \n\u201cAt this moment the boxes are being stored, charged and uploaded in Amsterdam and we are using them only onboard,\u201d said van de Velde. \u201c The next step might be that we roll out within the airports and our hotel transfer buses as well. We did a successful trial on the buses in mid-August.\u00a0 \n \nThe inflight IFE from the AirFi boxes should amount to considerable savings over an installed IFE solution for Arkefly. There is no need for the carrier to obtain a FAA Supplemental Type Certificate. Later this fall, the boxes will replace the overhead IFE system on the airline\u2019s 737. \n \nContent in the AirFi boxes includes daily newspapers, current magazines and the Arkefly inflight magazine. Also in the content are interactive games, destination information and videos. In the future van de Velde said he would like to roll out more digital rights managed material. \n \nArkefly is also testing an ordering process where passengers on medium and long haul flights can order food through their mobile devices. \n \n\u201cNormally on these flights, we have two caf\u00e9 services,\u201d explained van de Velde. \u201cDuring the trials, we still did the first service, but the second one was removed and passengers were asked instead to order using the TUI Cloud systems supported by the AirFi boxes.\u201d \n \nSince the rollout this past summer Arkefly has seen an average take rate of approximately 22% for the system and between 25,000 and 35,000 page views per day. Job Heimerikx, CEO of MI Airline, said such information will be important for future data management by Arkefly. \n \n\u201cEvery click, every movement, every page view duration is being stored,\u201d Heimerikx said. \u201cWe can provide the airline with data showing what content is being viewed on which flight, how many times and for how long. This helps them optimize the experience and decide which content stays on and what needs to go. They can also test out different menu structures to see what produces better sales figures.\u201d","title":"Arkefly chief outlines carrier's IFE program rollout","media-type":"News","source":"PAX International","published":"2015-09-17T03:13:55Z"}

Pay \u00a31,500 a month [$2,300] to sleep in someone's shed. They got so difficult to comprehend that we decided to start cataloguing them. \r \n\nWhat Is It? A shed! We've always joked about it in the nobody-reads-it-because-it's-in-italics paragraph at the top, but a shed! A fucking shed! \nWhere Is It? In someone's front room! In Bethnal Green! \nWhat Is There to Do Locally? Think about your life choices up to this point, I would've thought; \nAlright, How Much Are They Asking? \u00a3530 [$812], per month, bills included.\r \n\n\"Is London good, Joel?\" my friends back home ask me, in their quaint way, with their funny little accents and their cursory-at-best knowledge about metropolitan things like Ubers and guacamole, and I tell them \"Yes,\" I say. \"It takes an hour to get anywhere and all the burgers have pulled pork on them, and you pay to take a elevator to the top of the tallest skyscrapers, and look down but not jump. It's brilliant,\" I say, \"how everything is unlivably expensive and mad. People give you promotional bottles of Lucozade sometimes on the Tube!\" I say, and their eyes bulge in awe. \"You can rent a shed in someone's front room!\" I say, and they start screaming.\r \nOn VICE Sports: How a Former NCAA Basketball Player Became the First American in Aussie Rules Football  \r \nIt's difficult to process this one, mainly because this is a shed in a front room. A shed\u2014a shed, remember, is a specialist wooden box for dads to cry in and a place for normal people to keep their old plant pots and bikes\u2014but it has been erected not in a garden but in a front room, painted an inoffensive shade of off-white, nestled behind the sofa. It's like looking at a whale carefully hidden in an airplane, or a lamppost coming out of a frog\u2014something anonymous and boring, rendered insane by its context.\r \n\nThis was the discovery made by flathunter Joe Peduzzi when he went along to a SpareRoom viewing in Bethnal Green. \"'When I first walked in I sort of noticed the shed in the background but didn't really take it in,\" he said, after the viewing. \"Then I scanned around the room and couldn't see a bed so I asked where it was and the guy just pointed to the corner. I stuck my head in for a look but there was basically no room for movement. The mattress was right against the walls of this shed and the windows were blacked out.\" You might have missed it at the first scan-through, so please just read this quote again, with feeling: \" I sort of noticed the shed in the background but didn't really take it in\" .\r \n\nRelated: Watch our housing documentary, 'Regeneration Game' \n\nThe shed\u2014which was in a communal room, notice, so you would have to try to sleep in your shedbed while your flatmates eat curry literally inches away from you, or watched Big Bang Theory, or went on Snapchat\u2014or did any of the other millions of annoying housemate activities that housemates do, like legitimately try to engage you in a conversation about philosophy\u2014all while you tried to deal with the fundamentally clawing despair of trying to sleep in a blacked-out shed in a room in Bethnal Green, suddenly very much missing your family and your home, suddenly very much feeling like London isn't the city for you, because you're just playing at being a grown-up, aren't you? You're just a child, lost and alone and sitting in the dark in a locks-from-the-inside shed, and you think you're independent but you're not, and your job didn't turn out as good as you thought it would be, did it, and nothing really worked out how you envisioned it, and the nights are drawing in\u2014close and dark and cold\u2014and it's just you, in your Sonic pajamas, trying not to alert your housemates to the fact that you're trying to escape the doom with a cheeky shed-wank, trying not to move the mattress around too much as you try to manipulate your genitals because the mattress makes a sort of creaking sound against the side of your shed and they know, they know. Your parents were married by this age, had kids. They were eight years away from paying their mortgage off. They knew how to drive and both had a car. They had skills and read books. You've only just broken 100 followers on Twitter. Life. Life . It's shit.\r \n\nHere's that shed again, just in case you forgot about it somehow \n\nIn a way you have to respect the \"What? This is totally ordinary\" attitude of the dude trying to rent the shed, though. \"I had quite a hard time getting my head around it to be honest,\" Peduzzi said. \"I didn't ask what the story behind it was but he seemed to think it was pretty normal.\" Similarly, SpareRoom director Matt Hutchinson was pretty blas\u00e9 about the whole thing. \"We're no strangers to quirky ads but this one puts a whole new spin on the phrase 'beds in sheds,'\" he told the Mail , invoking a phrase literally nobody has ever used. \"There's no clear reason given for putting a bed inside a shed, inside a bedroom, but it could be because the other housemates use the room as communal space. It's a sign of the times that fewer house shares now have living rooms.\"\r \nOn NOISEY: No Money, No Space, No Time: How London Has Forced Out Musicians \r \nBut then this probably isn't the first attempt at indoor shed rental in London, and it won't be the last. Landlords are robots designed to spot how to turn slithers of potential space into a semi-livable but fully rentable opportunity, robots who say things like \"I fixed the boiler promptly as a sign of goodwill, but I will now be bringing up the rent to market value,\" robots who say, \"a handyman will be hitting everything in the house with a hammer on Sunday morning, hope that's OK,\" robots who say, \"no wonder you've got damp in here, you keep opening the windows! Don't open windows. That's an extra \u00a340 [$60] a month each on the rent,\" landlords who heave a flatpack shed up two sets of stairs to assemble it in a front room in an attempt to squeeze an extra \u00a3530 a month out of this broken, broken rental market.

{"id":"0b06e822-cdf2-4807-b460-e9ead139992e","content":"Do you remember my complainy posts earlier this year about how generally rubbish I felt? Well, I'm happy to report I'm feeling a lot better. Hooray! I'm sure you won't miss the moaning.\nThe thing is, I was at a point where I realised I wasn't taking care of myself, and I could feel and see the results. I was constantly ill, permanently exhausted and just looked awful. It wasn't a life highlight.\nA lot of it came down to diet and exercise, in the end. I always wish there was something simpler to do to change things, but in truth, if you're feeling crappy for months on end and don't have anything specific wrong with you, then you kind of have to look at what's you're doing with your body and what's going into it. I've tried all year to get back into Weight Watchers, as it worked so well for me in 2013, but while I started to feel a bit more human, I didn't see much result on the scales. Ultimately, losing weight is the goal - feeling better is priority, obviously, but fitting back into my beloved dresses would be a welcome side effect.\nI'm getting there though, finally. It's taken months, but my motivation is finally back, and I'm feeling great. I'm back to doing Weight Watchers strictly, rather than half-heartedly pointing my food a couple of days a week and then eating whatever I wanted for the rest of the time. The first week I did it properly, I lost 4.5lbs, which just shows me it works. I've lost about half a stone in the last month - it's not a massive number, but it's nice to see a result. And I know from experience that fast weight loss doesn't stay off. It needs to be a lifestyle change, or it won't work. Actually, since January, I'm nearly a stone down, which feels a touch more notable. But for me, it's that next stone that will mean something, that will see me back in the clothes that I miss wearing and feeling a bit more like Sarah again.\nAs I've written about, I'm eating vegetarian food 70-80% of the time and cooking from scratch almost always. And I've upped my exercise, so much so that I'm at that weird point where I WANT to do more. I'm pushing myself to do 10,000 steps a day - every day - thanks to my Fitbit, and I've also started swimming a few times a week. I ACHE. But in a good way. And what's really shocking is noticing how much more energy I have. I'm not falling asleep on the sofa at 9pm any more! I started feeling like an old lady, and while 33 isn't THAT young, I aten't dead yet (to quote Granny Weatherwax). There's still time in your thirties to undo bad habits and treat your body right, but what I didn't want to happen was to get to a point where it was too late.\nFor now, I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing. The thing I liked so much about Weight Watchers in the past was how much it got me into cooking, and that urge to experiment is back. I'm not focusing on what I can't have, but what I CAN have - which is everything, actually. Not in huge portions, perhaps, but chocolate, cheese, crisps and carbs are all very much still on the menu. At the moment, I'm having Saturdays 'off' and sticking to it the other six days, and that's fine. And I'm setting myself mini-goals, such as getting back into my red coat by the time I go to New York at the end of November, and into this beauty for Christmas. And then it'll be focusing on my sister's wedding next July, and squeezing into a bridesmaid's dress. I think it took me so long to get back to it because I do have conflicting feelings about weight loss. A big part of me wishes I could just learn to be happy with myself at a bigger size, and I envy women who do, who just OWN it... but I can't. Obsessing over my weight is something I've done my entire life, and it's a pretty much impossible habit to break. And I accept that, but what I refuse to do is go on a crazy diet, cutting out food groups for the sake of it, because I know I'd hate that and I don't want it to turn me into someone who doesn't love food any more. I know it won't be everyone's cup of tea, and that's fine - but I'm going to start doing monthly updates here with my latest news and maybe some advice. It helps me make sense of it to talk it out on here (being that kind of person is why I have a blog in the first place) and I like hearing from people who are struggling with it too, or have cracked it.

REUTERS\/Parker Song\/Pool  \nBy Katya Golubkova \n\nVLADIVOSTOK, Russia (Reuters) - Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang said on Saturday that Russia's push to revamp its run-down Far East region coincided with Beijing's strategy, backing President Vladimir Putin's drive for new sources of growth. \n\nAt the Eastern Economic Forum in the Pacific Port of Vladivostok on Friday, Putin promised favourable business conditions and state support to Asian and domestic investors willing to come to Russia's most remote land. \n\n\"The Far East development strategy coincides with China's strategy of north-east rebirth,\" Wang said. \"(The) Russia-Chinese partnership will definitely bring generous fruits.\" \n\nBut for Putin's campaign to attract Asian funds to Russia, timing may be his worst enemy: the slowdown in the Chinese economy poses risks. \n\nPutin's turn to Asia comes at a time when relations with the West have hit their lowest since the Cold War, following Moscow's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. \n\nRussia needs money badly - sanctions and falling oil prices have hit the economy hard, with gross domestic product expected to fall 3.3 percent this year after growing 0.6 percent in 2014. China's growth, meanwhile, is slowing and its stock market falling, forcing Beijing into rate cuts and a yuan devaluation to buttress the economy. \n\nIan Ivory, a partner at Golstblat BLP, said the Chinese slowdown will hardest affect emerging markets which are providers of raw materials. \n\n\"Russia is another classic example that will feel the pain, and China will be a further negative drag on the Russian economy,\" Ivory said in e-mailed comments. \n\nAndrey Kuzyayev, a former head of overseas operations at Lukoil, Russia's No.2 oil producer, played down the worries, saying the development of the Far East was not a temporary whim, but a long-term goal for the country. \n\n\"We need to make up time we have lost,\" he said. \"Cycles in any economy are the norm, not deviation. There will be a slowdown but obviously there will be acceleration later.\" \n\nChinese government's growth target is 7 percent this year, down from 7.4 percent in 2014 and the slowest in a quarter of a century. \n\nWang's address to the forum on Saturday was short and he left immediately afterwards, in the middle of the session, followed by Chinese officials, including Wang Yilin, chairman of the board at China National Petroleum Corporation. \n\n\"This was unexpected but this was okay, we managed,\" said Boris Titov, chairman of the Russian part of the China-Russia Friendship Committee for Peace and Development. \n\n\"The first session was delayed and they (the Chinese delegation) had already a briefing scheduled.\" \n\nA CNPC official, who was accompanying Yilin but declined to give his name, said only: \"The schedule has changed.\" \n\n(Additional reporting by Denis Dyomkin; Editing by Lidia Kelly and Alison Williams)","title":"China backs Putin's idea of developing Russia's Far East (Reuters)","media-type":"News","source":"Yahoo!

Building a future of freedom requires love of the common good and cooperation in a spirit of subsidiarity and solidarity.\" \n\nUpdated at 10:14 a.m. ET:  \n\nThe pontiff singles out four Americans as exemplars of the spirit of the country: President Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr., Dorothy Day , the founder of the Catholic Worker Movement and Thomas Merton , the American Cistercian monk, pacifist and author. \n\nUpdated at 10:10 a.m. ET:  \n\nFrancis says he wants to speak to all Americans: \"I would like to take this opportunity to dialogue with the many thousands of men and women who strive each day to do an honest day's work, to bring home the daily bread, to save money and \u2013one step at a time \u2013 to build a better life for their families.\" \n\nUpdated at 10:07 a.m. ET:  \n\n\"A political society endures when it seeks, as a vocation, to satisfy common needs by stimulating the growth of its members, especially those in situations of greater vulnerability or risk. Legislative activity is always based on the care of the people. To this you have been invited, called and convened by those who elected you.\" \n\nUpdated at 10:05 a.m. ET:  \n\nLoud applause after Francis says he's honored to address Congress in the \"land of the free; home of the brave.\" \n\nUpdated at 10:02 a.m. ET:  \n\nLawmakers clap and cheer as Pope Francis enters chamber. The pontiff takes the podium in front of House Speaker John Boehner and Vice President Joe Biden. Boehner introduces him to those gathered. \n\nHere's our original post ...  \n\nPope Francis, in his second full day in the United States, will address a joint meeting of Congress, where he is expected to encourage lawmakers to work together to help the poorest members of society. \n\nAhead of the address, Francis met with House Speaker John Boehner, who has dismissed concerns that the pope's visit will stir political controversy. \n\n\"The pope transcends all of this,\" Boehner said. \"He appeals to our better angels and brings us back to our daily obligations. The best thing we can all do is listen, open our hearts to his message and reflect on his example.\" \n\nAttending are some 500 lawmakers and officials. Four Supreme Court justices, including three of the six Catholics on the bench, will be present \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts, as well as justices Anthony Kennedy and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is Jewish, will also attend. \n\nAs The New York Times writes: \"In his first visit to the United States, Francis, 78, seemed eager to pass over his previous criticisms of a materialistic, capitalist culture and instead reach out to the world's most powerful nation. He praised the country's devotion to freedom of liberty and religion even as he cautioned that its vast resources demanded a deep sense of moral responsibility. \"God bless America,\" he said at the White House.\" \n\nNPR's Tamara Keith notes that Francis will be speaking to a group of lawmakers who are much more Christian than the rest of the nation.  \n\nAfter his address, the pope is scheduled to visit St. Patrick in the City and Catholic Charities for the Archdiocese of Washington. He is expected to have lunch with the homeless being served by the charity's St. Maria's Meals program. \n\nIn the afternoon, he will fly to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and attend vespers in the evening at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  \n\nOn Friday, he will address the United Nations General Assembly.","title":"'I Am Convinced That We Can Make A Difference,' Pope Tells Congress","media-type":"News","source":"KCBX","published":"2015-09-24T14:03:15Z"}

I had to have surgery (twenty-five staples) to reattach the quadricep muscle so the bottom half of my left leg would work again. \u00a0\nRecovery was twelve weeks long,\u00a0including a month and a half of three times a week physical therapy. \u00a0And I am walking now for which I will be forever grateful. \u00a0Just as I will be forever grateful that Bill was here to help me through this, one of the most difficult periods of my life.\nMy real test though was a few weeks ago when I took my annual vacation to visit my\u00a0friend Pat at his home in Toronto. \u00a0On the way we stopped by Niagara Falls for a day's stay. \u00a0And we did a LOT of walking. \u00a0It was then I found my limitations. \u00a0I can't walk like I used too. \u00a0\nWalking was always the one thing that I had. \u00a0My life has been walking. \u00a0I didn't grow up with the privilege of having my parents present me with a car on my sixteenth birthday. \u00a0No such\u00a0privilege for me (just as not having a college education supplied for me). \u00a0Whoops! \u00a0Am I whining again? I guess so but after all these years I still haven't reconciled to those facts and probably never will. \u00a0But not having a car, especially during my high school years, meant that I walked a lot and I mean A LOT. \u00a0And all those years I lived in center city Philadelphia (eleven), I walked to work every day. \u00a0Sun, rain, cold, heat . . . . I walked often passing my co-worker and friend Don McK. standing\u00a0not eh corner waiting for his bus to\u00a0take him to the same location, the bank where we both worked next to the Philadelphia City Hall.\nSo I had to drag myself around walking with Pat as we tried to cover all the tourist enticements in Niagara Falls. \u00a0I was so embarrassed that I couldn't keep up, me The Walker. \u00a0But Pat said\u00a0not to worry.\nThese days, I go out every morning before breakfast and take\u00a0my walk,\u00a0probably less than a mile. \u00a0I hope to build up my endurance and get back to back to my previous walking abilities. \u00a0I don't know if I'll ever get there but what I do know is that I am walking now. And for that I will be forever grateful.\nJust don't fall of the ladder Ron!","title":"How's the Leg?","media-type":"Blog","source":"Retired in Delaware","published":"2015-09-17T15:12:46Z"}

{"id":"ff2afe2c-6d8c-47f1-b0c1-8cc02d7dd681","content":"The post Why You Should Regularly Backup Your WordPress Site appeared first on HostGator Blog | Gator Crossing . \n \n\n \nEditor\u2019s Note: the information in this post, while incredibly valuable, is simply non-applicable to those who use owr Optimized WordPress Hosting , as HostGator manages all aspects of backups and security.  Having said that, please enjoy the information contained herein, and do apply the same logic to non-WordPress sites as well:\u201d \n\u00a0 \n \nWordPress is the most popular content management system on the planet. And for good reason. It\u2019s easy to use, and offers an incredible wealth of functionality through plugins. \n \nLet\u2019s consider just one aspect of managing a site: performing backups. There are many reliable, easy-to-use plugins available for backing up a WordPress site. That\u2019s why you regularly backup your business WordPress site. \n \nRight? \n \n\u00a0 \n No? You\u2019re Not Alone\u2026  \nA recent survey revealed that nearly half of WordPress users do not perform regular backups. \n \nSo if you don\u2019t frequently backup your WordPress site, you\u2019ve got lots of company. Perhaps that will offer you some measure of consolation. After all, according to the old saying, misery loves company. \n \nAnd if you continue to be lax about backing up your site, it\u2019s quite possible that you will end up miserable \u2013 but with lots of company. \n \nThat\u2019s because bad things can happen to any website \u2013 even WordPress-powered sites. \n \n\u00a0 \n Updates, Break-Ins and Blunders  \nAccording to a Small Business Trends report , regularly backing up your WordPress site may save you from one (or more) of three common occurrences that regularly vex website owners: \n  Update Problems : Like any other well-maintained piece of software, WordPress code is frequently updated. That means that your WordPress site should be frequently updated. But with each update, there\u2019s a risk \u2013 a possibility that one of the plugins you use won\u2019t be in sync with the code update. And that can cause major problems, up to and including the complete failure of your website.   \nIf that happens, it\u2019s really not a major problem. You identify the problem plugin, replace or update it, and restore your site with the most recent backup. \n \nYou say your backup is months old? Or you don\u2019t even have a backup? Umm, OK\u2026 now you have a major problem on your hands. And lots of miserable company. \n  Attacks and Hacks : Your site is under constant threat of a cyber attack. In fact, the cyber security company Symantec recently reported that nearly a third of all cyber attacks target small businesses. There\u2019s much you can do to defend your site against cyber criminals. But alas, there\u2019s no way to assure that your site is absolutely invulnerable.   \nSo if the worst happens and your site does get hacked, having a very recent backup will go far towards minimizing the downtime \u2013 and the pain. \n  Oopsies : Accidental file deletions happen with great regularity. In fact, there are really only two types of people: those who have accidentally deleted files, and those that will. So if an accidental deletion hasn\u2019t yet occurred at your business, it will. It\u2019s only a matter of time.   \nAnd when it happens, it\u2019s not a big deal. Not if you have a recent backup. But if you don\u2019t have a backup? Well, you have our sympathies. \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \n So How Frequently Should You Perform Backups?  \nFor most businesses, daily backups are best. Particularly active businesses may even wish to perform backups multiple times per day. But certainly no business should go more than a week without performing a backup. \n \nBackups, after all, are easy. They can be automated to occur seamlessly and behind the scenes. There are lots of options for WordPress users, ranging from free plugins to paid third-party services. \n \nAnd cloud-based backup options can even protect your business data from calamities such as natural disasters and fires. \n \n\u00a0 \n Just Do It\u2026  \nAs the old Nike commercial recommends, when it comes to backing up your WordPress site \u2013 just do it. Choose your preferred backup method, and just do it. And do it frequently. \n \nAfter all, misery may indeed love company. But your company doesn\u2019t love misery, does it? \n \n\u00a0 \n \n***** \n Chris Delker is a freelance copywriter based in Dallas, Texas. \n \nweb hosting","title":"Why You Should Regularly Backup Your WordPress Site","media-type":"Blog","source":"HostGator Blog | Gator Crossing","published":"2015-08-04T16:54:07Z"}

They are essentially artists, and for them motorcycles are a canvas to unleash their creativity, or mobile art exhibits, which have the potential to convey a message and be appreciated wherever they go.\nThe duo is armed with a series of awards under their belt \u2013 namely Best Custom Harley at over 6 Indian H.O.G. rallies in the past 3 years, and were also crowned the winners at India Bike Week 2013.\nGodspeed Customs\nNikesh & Neel\u2019s journey began at India Bike Week 2014, wherein the former transformed his Harley-Davidson Sportster Forty Eight into a Bobber and was awarded the best customized Sportster of the year at the event. It was at the same event that he shared a room with a fellow H.O.G. rider Neel Urumese and very soon they realized that they had a common Vision to \u201cBuild Bikes that can Be Ridden\u201d. Partnering with him was instant and rest is history that was the birth of Godspeed Customs in 2014.\nBike building is a passion for them and they want to be known for \u201chand-fabbed, perfect hard-ridden, real-world motorcycles\u201d. Their passion for creativity recently won them the customized bike of the year with a Harley-Davidson SuperLow at India Bike Week 2015.\nTJ Moto\nTushar Jaitely started off two years ago with his first ever bike \u2013 a Harley-Davidson Sportster Iron 883\u2122, which he redesigned completely. That motorcycle made waves over the internet with the bike being featured on several online magazines and was even on the list of the 10 Best Customs of 2014 of \u2018Pipeburn\u2019, a website that features some of the world\u2019s most radical custom motorcycles. Tushar\u2019s name was also featured in GQ\u2019s list of the top 4 bike builders in the country at the age of 24.\nHe follows no fixed design philosophy other than that of being minimalistic. Going by that, his favorite Harley-Davidson models to work on are the Sportster line, as he says they\u2019ve got just the right amount of everything.\nTNT Motorcycles\nAfter spending 3 years of painstaking follow up, a ton of cash (and of course a donor bike) Naveen and Nitin were left high and dry by a local custom builder. This got them stirred up about doing a custom build on their own. With a collective experience of 12 years in design, manufacturing and development in major Original Equipment Manufacturer designs, Nitin and Naveen started building a \u2018Zero Chop\u2019 with India Bike Week 2014 as a deadline.\nTheir first creation \u201cShunya\u201d was conceived with 90% in-house machining and fabrication and it was the crowd\u2019s over-whelming reaction which convinced them to shed their corporate 9 to 5 avatars and TNT Motorcycles was born on 1st March 2014.\u00a0They follow the simple philosophy \u2018to create the unknown\u2019, and to create unique builds while keeping them rider friendly for day to day rides.\nMotoMiu\nWith just about a year in the business, Saurabh Shirke and Arjun Bafna\u2019s MotoMiu has already bagged wins for one of their creations \u2013 Katanga Uno, the first place for the Best Dealer Custom at the 2014 Indian H.O.G. Rally and India Bike week.\nTheir philosophy is that the motorcycle should be reliable and fun to ride. In keeping with that philosophy, they shun the old school hammer and chisel method for modern state of the art tools and everything is measured precisely for optimum weight distribution. They also try and replace a lot of the iron with aluminum as that reduces weight leading to higher performance, better handling and better mileage. The Harley-Davidson Softail series is their preferred choice of canvas.","title":"List : Five motorcycle customizers are that all set for the  \u2018Custom Champion\u2019 contest at Harley Rock Riders Season VI","media-type":"Blog","source":"Motoroids","published":"2015-09-18T15:19:10Z"}

(Photo: AFP) \n \nThree National Guard members died in a grenade blast during the clashes \n \nMoscow : Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday condemned the deadly clashes that took place this week between police and nationalists in Kiev and questioned how long Ukrainians would \"put up with\" the instability rocking the country. \n \nIn his first public comments on the unrest, Putin lamented the \"tragic events\" which unfolded outside Ukraine's parliament on Monday after a vote on granting more autonomy to regions, including two breakaway pro-Russian regions in the east. \n \nThree National Guard members died in a grenade blast during the clashes, which the government blamed on an ultra-nationalist group. \n \nSpeaking at an international economic forum in Vladivostok, Putin was quoted by TASS state news agency as saying the violence constituted \"the next enactment of the political confrontation in Ukraine\", where the ouster of a pro-Russian president in 2014 brought a pro-Western government to power. \n \nAsked how he saw events in the former Soviet state unfolding, Putin said: \"This doesn't depend on us, this depends on Ukraine itself, on the Ukrainian people, how long the Ukrainian people will put up with this bacchanalia.\" \n \nThe constitutional reforms being debated by Kiev's parliament, which passed a first reading in parliament Monday, are part of a package of reforms required under a February peace deal between Ukraine and pro-Russian rebels in the east who took up arms against Kiev after the February 2014 ouster of Russian-backed then president Viktor Yanukovych. \n \nPutin said that it was \"crucial\" to give more powers to the separatist Donetsk and Lugansk regions. He also urged Ukraine to pass a law on amnesty for combattants.","title":"Vladimir Putin slams 'tragic' clashes in Kiev over autonomy for rebel east","media-type":"News","source":"Asian Age","published":"2015-09-03T18:30:00Z"}

Any film about him must operate on multiple levels, demystifying parts of his life while affirming the cultural myths he posthumously came to embody.\n\nLife, written by the Australian novelist and screenwriter Luke Davies (Candy) and directed by the Dutch filmmaker Anton Corbijn\u200b (The American), makes their James Dean (Dane DeHaan\u200b) the enigmatic quarry of struggling photographer Dennis Stock (Robert Pattinson). Based in Los Angeles, Stock pitches rising Hollywood star Dean as a subject for a pictorial essay to his photo agency editor, John Morris (Joel Edgerton), who in turn gets a commission from Life magazine.\n\nRichard Attenborough's Chaplin had a fine performance by Robert Downey jnr in the title role, but was felled by a vast, ineffectual scale, whereas Life is concentrated into a few weeks but lacks a convincing lead.\n\nDeHaan not only falls short in resembling Dean \u2013 he lacks the necessary leanness, while his overly high-pitched voice sometimes recalls Fozzie Bear from The Muppets \u2013 he also can't suggest the qualities that made him so magnetic on the screen.\n\nCorbijn saves Stock's now famous black-and-white photographs for the end credits, and thankfully doesn't attempt to recreate any of Dean's screen performances.\n\n\"Who is that guy?\" a voice whispers in wonder as Elia Kazan\u200b's East of Eden screens, but the camera stays on Stock as the enraptured viewer watching Dean's breakthrough performance, and the film can't answer the question.\n\nThe dynamic between the two men concertinas between friendship and disdain, without coming into tight focus, and it's not helped by the lack of vitality from Corbijn, himself a celebrated photographer, compared to his previous feature, 2014's fine A Most Wanted Man. The film is best at catching the traditional social structure that would be swept away by Dean's creation of the teenager as a cultural and soon commercial force.\n\nThe actor, already being coerced by his rapacious studio boss, Jack Warner (Ben Kingsley), is ambivalent about success, but Stock isn't, and insecurity and sour ambition seep out of Pattinson's performance as a hopeful young artist watching his subject duck opportunities.\n\nPattinson, who has pushed himself into more demanding roles after his own teen idol phase in the Twilight franchise, is the best thing in this flawed, sometimes emotionally shapeless movie. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","title":"Life review: James Dean movie is a cause without a rebel","media-type":"News","source":"Sunraysia Daily","published":"2015-09-12T14:15:01Z"}

Lynch, speaking at the same news conference as Lauber, said new charges and arrests against ''individuals and entities'' were anticipated. \n \nLauber also revealed that assets including flats in the Swiss Alps and western Switzerland had been seized by his investigators, on suspicion of being used for money-laundering purposes, and that 121 different bank accounts have been brought to the attention of the investigating task force. \n \nIn May, the US justice department announced indictments against 18 people on football-related corruption charges - four have pleaded guilty to charges. \n \nLynch told the news conference on Monday: \"Separate and apart from the pending indictment our investigation has expanded since May. The scope of our investigation is not limited and is following the evidence where it leads. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n\"We do anticipate pursuing additional charges against individuals and entities.\" \n \nAsked if Blatter was under investigation or if it might interfere with his travel plans - the FIFA president did not travel to the women's World Cup in  Canada in June following the arrests in May - Lynch added: \"I'm not going to comment on individuals and I am not able to give you information about Mr Blatter's travel plans.\"","title":"Swiss approve extradition of former FIFA VP Eugenio Figueredo","media-type":"News","source":"Ludlow Advertiser","published":"2015-09-17T14:12:25Z"}

{"id":"26657191-3267-4398-b31e-d33649cab756","content":"An ex-bishop who abused 18 young men and aspiring priests over 30 years has finally admitted his guilt after a last-ditch effort to throw his case out on the word of a former Archbishop of Canterbury failed. \n\nFormer Bishop of Lewes Peter Ball, 83, used religion as a \"cloak\" to manipulate his victims, many of whom were in their teens, after they came to his home to explore their spirituality.\n\nIn 1993, he accepted a caution in relation to one young man and resigned his post, believing the matter was closed despite police being aware of two more complaints.\n\nBut in 2012, prompted by a Church of England review, Sussex Police reopened the case and last year charged him with a string of sex offences against teenage boys and young men who had gone to his former home in Litlington, East Sussex. \n\nEarlier this year, Mr Justice Sweeney refused to dismiss the case on a legal technicality after it emerged Ball and former archbishop Lord Carey had been assured in 1993 that there would be no future action once he accepted the caution.\n\nToday, weeks before his trial was due to start at the Old Bailey, Ball, who has suffered ill health but was deemed fit to stand trial, pleaded guilty to misconduct in a public office. \n\nThe charge stated that between 1977 and 1992 he misused his position in authority \"to manipulate and prevail upon others for his own sexual gratification\" in relation to 16 young men. \n\nHe also admitted two counts of indecent assault on two separate young men in their late teens at his East Sussex home between 1980 and 1983 and between 1990 and 1991. \n\nTwo other counts of indecent assault on a boy of 12 or 13 and a 15-year-old youth were denied and will lie on file.\n\nAfterwards, Detective Chief Inspector Carwyn Hughes of Sussex Police said 12 of the victims had come forward since the investigation was launched. \n\nHe said: \"It became clear that under the guise of his status as a Bishop, Ball had systematically abused the trust of the victims, many of whom who were aspiring priests, whilst others were simply seeking to explore their spirituality.\n\n\"He abused that trust and used religion, through his Give A Year For Christ scheme, as a cloak behind which to carry out his grooming activity, the principal aim of which was to satisfy his sexual interest in and desire for young men.\n\n\"We put tremendous effort into thoroughly and diligently investigating these allegations over several years, where necessary even sending officers abroad to interview witnesses and victims.\"\n\nDetails of the long history leading to the former clergyman being reinvestigated can only be reported today after restrictions were lifted by Mr Justice Wilkie.\n\nIn 1993, the Church of England avoided scandal when Ball, by then Bishop of Gloucester, accepted a caution for a single historic allegation of gross indecency and resigned, despite Gloucester Police being aware of allegations by two more men. \n\nOn March 5 that year, his lawyer received a letter from the Crown Prosecution Service which the defence said related to all allegations against Ball.\n\nIt stated: \"The view is taken that there is sufficient admissible, substantial and reliable evidence available to support prosecuting your client for offences of indecent assault and gross indecency.\n\n\"Having regards to all the circumstances, however, the Crown would be prepared to allow disposal less than prosecution - namely a caution for an offence of gross indecency with (a 19-year-old man) as an alternative to prosecution.\"\n\nRichard Smith QC, suggested the CPS may have settled on the caution to avoid the publicity of a bishop in the dock after discussion \"behind closed doors\" and not because there was no realistic prospect of conviction.\n\nGiving evidence at that hearing, Ball insisted that the police officer who cautioned him had clearly told him that was the end of it. \n\nHe recalled: \"After I took the caution I asked very clearly 'Does this include all other offences of the same nature?' before the taking of the caution and I was told very clearly that it did.\n\n\"I can remember so clearly I was so glad to get away - to get a guarantee that it was all over.\n\n\"That was the last words of the police officer - 'Bishop, it's all over'.\n\n\"I was so pleased I went like a rocket down to Cornwall to my brother.\"\n\nLord Carey, who was Archbishop of Canterbury at the time, appeared to back up his claim in his recollections of the incident which were read out in court.\n\nOn hearing the news of Ball's caution, he wrote: \"I was troubled. I did not think this was good enough. I wanted some form of assurance. \n\n\"All we had was the resignation of Bishop Peter.\n\n\"I was worried that if any other allegations of past indecency were made it would reignite. I wanted some reassurance that this would not be the case. \n\n\"I was so troubled, that evening after dinner I went to my study.\n\n\"I was supplied with a number of a man at the CPS I believed to be a director. I do not recall his name. \n\n\"I rang him and asked what might happen if allegations from the past were made.\n\n\"I was told quite categorically that the other allegations would not be taken further as far as we are concerned.\n\n\"He has resigned. He is out of it. The matter is closed. We are not going to take anything any further.\" \n\nThe defendant also claimed that a promise to resign from his post was a condition of the police caution, even though he later explored the possibility of being allowed back to work. \n\nCambridge-educated Ball, who now lives in Langport, Somerset, appeared frail and falteringly entered his pleas via video link from Taunton Crown Court. \n\nMr Justice Wilkie remanded him on bail to await sentencing on October 7. \n\nBall was Bishop of Lewes between 1977 and 1992 and Bishop of Gloucester from 1992 until his resignation the following year. \n\nHe was said to have many high-profile friends and acquaintances, including the Prince of Wales. \n\nCopyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved.","title":"Ex-Bishop of Lewes Peter Ball admits abusing 18 young men","media-type":"News","source":"Bognor Regis Observer","published":"2015-09-08T13:28:00Z"}

{"id":"7447cb19-0ed0-4c89-9c99-bbfd72b082ce","content":"In this photo provided by the Vatican paper L'Osservatore Romano, Pope Francis meets Pope emeritus Benedict XVI in Castel Gandolfo Saturday, March 23, 2013. Pope Francis has traveled to Castel Gandolfo to have lunch with his predecessor Benedict XVI in a historic and potentially problematic melding of the papacies that has never before confronted the Catholic Church. The Vatican said the two popes embraced on the helipad. In the chapel where they prayed together, Benedict offered Francis the traditional kneeler used by the pope. Francis refused to take it alone, saying \"We're brothers,\" and the two prayed together on the same one. (AP Photo\/Osservatore Romano, HO) \n \nUncredited, AP \n \nEnlarge photo\u00bb \n   \nVATICAN CITY \u2014 NAME: Jorge Mario Bergoglio. As of March 13, 2013, Pope Francis. \n \nDOB: Dec. 17, 1936 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Born the eldest of five children to Italian immigrants Mario Bergoglio, an accountant, and Regina Sivori, a homemaker. His youngest sister, Maria Elena Bergoglio, still lives in Buenos Aires. \n \nNAMESAKE: Francis is the first pope to name himself after St. Francis of Assisi. The 13th century monk was born to a wealthy cloth merchant but cast aside his worldly wealth and devoted himself to the poor and to rebuilding a church that had fallen into spiritual ruin. Francis of Assisi is also known for his love of nature, and Francis the pope named his most important document \u2014 his environment encyclical \"Praise Be\" \u2014 after Francis the monk's Canticle of Creation. \n \nDAILY ROUTINE: Francis rises on his own at around 4:30 a.m. and spends the next two hours praying, meditating on the Scripture readings for the day and preparing his morning homily. He delivers it off-the-cuff at the 7 a.m. Mass in the chapel of the Vatican's Santa Marta hotel where he lives. After Mass, Francis greets the faithful in the atrium outside the chapel, then walks a few meters into the hotel dining room for breakfast. He often will have fresh-squeezed orange juice (a papal indulgence since other diners are served only packaged OJ) and membrillo, a gelatinous paste made from quince that is popular in Argentina. \n \nAfter breakfast, Francis takes Elevator A up to the second floor to his home: Santa Marta's Room 201, though he has actually converted the entire second floor of the hotel wing into a home office. He then gets to work, either staying in the hotel or heading to the Apostolic Palace if he has formal audiences. Occasionally he takes a break to recite the rosary. After a 1 p.m. lunch in the dining room, Francis takes a siesta of about 40 minutes to an hour and resumes working into the evening, often taking care of correspondence. He tries to get in an hour of adoration before the Blessed Sacrament before dinner, though he confesses to sometimes falling asleep while praying. \n \nDinner in the dining room is self-service, cafeteria-style at 8 p.m. and Francis has been known to microwave his own food if it's not warm enough. Before taking the elevator back upstairs, he will be sure to thank the Swiss Guard, Vatican gendarme and reception desk clerk on duty in the hotel lobby, and say good-night. He's in bed by 9 p.m., reads for an hour and is asleep \u2014 \"like a log\" \u2014 for the next six hours or so. \n \nVACATION ROUTINE: Unlike his predecessors, Francis has never used the papal summer retreat at Castel Gandolfo in the hills south of Rome, preferring to stay home and just lighten his schedule. During vacation, Francis says he wakes up later and does more reading for pleasure, listening to music and praying. \n \nHOBBIES: Francis is a lifelong fan of soccer and has kept his membership in his beloved San Lorenzo club (Member No. 88235N-0). But he doesn't watch it on TV \u2014 in fact he says he hasn't watched TV since 1990 when he made a promise to the Virgin of Carmen that he would abstain from then on since TV \"just wasn't for me.\" For news, he reads the middle-brow Rome daily Il Messaggero. \n \nFAVORITE FOODS: Francis adores mate, the typical Argentine tea, and readily sips from mate gourds handed up to him from fans. He prefers meat over fish and has a sweet-tooth: Friends from home bring him alfajores, the Argentine cookies filled with dulce de leche and covered in chocolate. But visitors to the Santa Marta dining room say he's not a finicky eater and consumes pretty much anything he is served. He has said he misses going out for pizza and recalls fondly getting pizzas after watching San Lorenzo games at Buenos Aires' \"Gasometro\" stadium en famille.","title":"Pope's likes, dislike, daily routine and favorite foods","media-type":"News","source":"Deseret Morning News","published":"2015-09-21T19:33:53Z"}

This usually translates to fire and brimstone about same-sex marriage and reproductive freedom, but, on Friday, Marco Rubio veered off that script and talked about something unexpected from a current Republican presidential candidate: the importance of paid leave. \n \n\u201cOne of the greatest threats to family today is that too many Americans have to choose between being there for their children in times of great need, or meeting the basic financial needs of their families,\u201d he said before pointing out that losing a paycheck to stay home with a new baby or sick relative is \u201csimply not a viable financial option for many Americans.\u201d \n \nHe\u2019s right.

According to the same data, just one in 20 workers in the bottom quartile can take time off without losing necessary income. \n \nRubio\u2019s plan would offer a 25% tax credit to employers who offer a minimum of 4 weeks of paid family leave. The maximum pay out per employee, to full-time and part-time workers, would be $4,000, and the maximum leave time would be 12 weeks. \u201cFor instance,\u201d Rubio explained, \u201cif you are offered $1,600 in paid leave for four weeks while you take care of your newborn, which would be the equivalent of about $10 an hour, your employer could claim a tax credit for $400.\u201d \n \nNow here\u2019s another essential part of the plan: it\u2019s fully voluntary. Rubio doesn\u2019t believe the government should require federal leave, and wants to leave it to the market to sort out. \n \nProblem is, the market has already tried, and failed, to sort this out. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve already let the market have its say,\u201d Teresa Boyer, executive director and assistant research professor at Rutgers University\u2019s Center for Women and Work, told me over the weekend. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about how this will impact the workers who most need it,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now, the U.S. doesn\u2019t require it by law, and neither does this proposal. It\u2019s just an incentive. In the U.S., there are a number of workers who get paid family leave, but they get it through their employers, and they\u2019re usually higher paid professional workers or workers at larger companies. So when I hear something like a tax credit, I think it\u2019s really just going to provide further financial backing to these companies that have the deeper pockets in the first place.\u201d \n \nPlus, there is already a market incentive to offer paid leave: it boosts productivity and helps companies attract and retain workers. That\u2019s exactly why you have companies like Netflix rolling out deceptively lush unlimited leave plans for high-end salaried employees but leaving out the people who work in its DVD distribution centers. \n \n\u201cA number of employers already offer it to their highly valued employees\u2014it\u2019s about employee retention,\u201d Boyer explained. \u201cSo if you leave it up to the market, you\u2019ll have a very similar situation to what we have now: paid family leave is offered to certain employees, but not to all. \n \n\u201cAnd my focus as a researcher has always been that these sorts of work supports reach the low-income people who are working part-time job to part-time job, trying to make ends meet, but aren\u2019t able to do that when they have to take leave,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019m thinking that a tax credit would not provide that kind of access. The types of employers that are there aren\u2019t going to be as incentivized as those larger companies.\u201d \n \nThe other problem with Rubio\u2019s plan: it isn\u2019t portable. If you leave your job, something you\u2019re more likely to do if you\u2019re stitching together several part-time gigs, then you leave the benefit behind, too. \u201cAnd think about the workers who are most at risk here, they do change jobs,\u201d Boyer said. \n \nUltimately, she summarized the plan this way: \u201cIt\u2019s not going to harm anyone, but it\u2019s not really going to help anyone, either.\u201d \n \nBut I\u2019d add one note: the person Marco Rubio\u2019s paid leave plan will help most is Marco Rubio. \n \nPaid leave is an immensely popular policy, with 80% of Americans coming out in favor of paid time off . Its surging popularity, and the increasingly dire situation millions of working families find themselves in, has pushed the issue into the political mainstream. Whereas paid leave was a political pipe dream this time last year, it\u2019s become a centerpiece of the campaigns being run by Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Martin O\u2019Malley. \n \nAnd the Republican presidential field\u2019s uniform opposition to a federal paid leave policy, and its lack of alternative suggestions, puts it wildly out of step with a vast majority of voters. So Rubio, in taking what is essentially a no-risk position to incentivize paid leave for companies that are already offering it or flirting with the idea of offering it, gets to distinguish himself as the Republican contender who says he values families and means it. \n \nAt a moment when the GOP has come to define itself by Donald Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant vitriol and Ted Cruz\u2019s looming threats of a shutdown, Rubio is positioning himself as the even-handed grownup in the room, and that may appeal to establishment Republicans who are kind of freaking out about their party\u2019s presidential prospects . \n \nRubio\u2019s paid leave proposal could be a big boost for Rubio, but the 26 million private sector workers who don\u2019t have access to any paid time off will need more than a bit of slick campaigning to make ends meet. If they\u2019re looking for a policy that will make that juggling act more manageable, they\u2019ll have to look elsewhere.","title":"Who really benefits from Marco Rubio's paid leave plan","media-type":"News","source":"Fusion.net","published":"2015-09-28T16:57:55Z"}
{"id":"8024d4d7-d14f-478c-91e7-8f17607108f3","content":"I've covered a fair bit on lenses this past week, c omparing different focal lengths and understanding lens compression , and I thought I'd rewind a bit for any new photographers, and talk about what the numbers on the lens mean.\u00a0 \n\nThis was one of my very first questions I had when buying my DSLR and it took me a little while to figure out! Hopefully this post will help break this down if you are new to lenses too.\u00a0 \n\nSo, let's take a look at some lenses and break down the numbers to see what they mean, and what you should look for.\u00a0 \n\nLet's start with a lens that you will often see sold as a \"kit lens\" with your camera:\u00a0\u00a0 \n18-55mm f\/3.5-5.6 \nLets look at what 18-55mm means first. The numbers before the \u201dmm\u201d relate to the focal length of the lens. Essentially, focal length means what you are going to be able to see when you look through the viewfinder. (Ever looked through the lens and everything looked closer than it actually was, or further away? That is your focal length - you can see a full comparison of different focal lengths here )\u00a0\u00a0The important thing for you to know is that the lower the focal length (smaller the number) the wider the view - i.e. you will be able to see more in your image. \n\nThe higher the focal length (bigger number) the less of your image you will see, in other words it will look more zoomed in. I\u2019m quite a visual person so here are a couple of examples of some different focal lengths in practice (I\u2019m sitting in the same place for all 3) \n    \nAs you can see the smaller number has the widest view, and the biggest number has the most \"zoomed in\" view.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nSo when you see the focal length numbers of a lens, the first thing you are probably going to want to know how this is going to look compared to \u201dreal\u201d life. \u00a0This will be different depending on whether you have a cropped frame camera like the Rebel or a full frame camera like the 6D. I\u2019m going to start with explaining the full frame because it is the easiest to understand. \n\nOn a full frame, a focal length of 50mm will \u201dsee\u201d roughly the same view as you do with your naked eye. Remember this, because when you look at the focal length of a particular lens you will be able to tell whether this will give you a view that will include more in the frame or less. If the lens has a higher number than 50mm for the focal length, like 85mm, you will see less through the frame and it will look more \u201dzoomed\u201d in. If it has a lower number, like 35 mm, the more you will see in the frame. \u00a0Look at the images above again for a comparison.\u00a0 \n\nQuite simple so far, but this is where it gets a bit more complicated. If you are just starting out, you probably don\u2019t have a full format camera, you will have a cropped frame, and this makes a world of difference to how the focal length \u201dperforms\u201d on your camera. For example, if I put the same 50mm lens on a cropped body camera, instead of the scene through my viewfinder being the same as the naked eye, it will actually look a lot closer - more like how an 85mm would perform on a full frame. \u00a0This is to all to do with the size of the sensor being different. \n\nSo how can you figure out how a particular lens is going to perform on your cropped frame camera? \u00a0What you need to do is multiply the focal length by a \u201dcrop factor\u201d to see how it compares to the full frame. For a Canon Rebel,\u00a0the crop factor is 1.6. What I can work out from this is that in order to get the same view on a cropped body as I would see with the naked eye, I would need around about a 30mm focal length. (30mm x 1.6 = 48mm) \n\nA focal length of 50mm on a cropped body will look more \u201dzoomed\u201d in than real life, and look more like an 85mm focal length on a full frame would. (50mm x 1.6 = 80mm) \n\nDifferent cameras have different sized crop sensors, so you need to know your particular model\u2019s \u201dcrop factor\u201d - Canon\u2019s is 1.6, but Nikon\u2019s is 1.5. As usual DPS have a brilliant article which gives you all the information at a glance here. It also includes a table that shows the equivalent lens sizes for the different crops factors. \n\nAnyway, back to understanding the lens with the 18-55mm focal range. On a cropped body camera, this equates to a focal length range of 29-88 (I\u2019ve just multiplied the numbers by 1.6) As you remember, 50mm is the \u201dnaked eye equivalent\u201d. So, this is a great focal range on a crop body!\u00a0 You\u2019d get the same view as the naked eye, a more \u201czoomed in\u201d view, and a more \u201czoomed out\u201d view, so it's a great all rounder.\u00a0 \n\nThat same lens on a full frame body is perhaps not so versatile \u2013 the 18mm is very wide (great for landscapes) and we will get roughly the same view as the naked eye at it's maximum focal length.\u00a0 \n\nSo, remember that your type of camera body makes a different to how the lens will perform. \n\nLet\u2019s move on the next set of numbers, which if you remember, was f\/3.5-5.6 . This refers to the aperture range of the lens and is lovely and simple to explain. Aperture is basically how big the opening in your lens is when you take your picture. The size of this opening is measured in f\/stops. The smaller the number, the wider the opening and therefore the more light gets into your camera. \n\nSo, this particular lens has an aperture range of 3.5 to 5.6. If you have two numbers (like this one) separated by a dash, this means that the aperture changes with the focal length of the zoom. Use the lens at 55mm and you will have a maximum aperture of 5.6. At 18mm,\u00a0 the maximum aperture will be F3.5. The particular aperture range of this lens doesn\u2019t go nearly as low as I want it to go to let lots of yummy light into my camera and get the nice creamy backgrounds I\u2019m looking for (I want at least F2.8)- so I know that this isn\u2019t the lens for me.\u00a0 \n\nSo, now you can apply this knowledge to other lenses to work out what they mean. Lets look at a couple more..... \n  50mm f\/1.4 \nIt only has one number before the mm, which means it is a \u201dfixed\u201d or \u201dprime\u201d lens - it does not zoom and has a fixed focal length. The 50mm means that it sees the same as the naked eye on a full frame but on a cropped frame, it is going to behave more like an 85mm (50mm x 1.6) and make everything look a bit closer than it actually is, but that\u2019s OK, as it\u2019s a good portrait length, which is is fine if that's what I\u2019m going to use it for. There\u2019s only one F number - F1.4, which is the lowest aperture setting this lens can go to, which is nice and low so I can get lots of nice light into my camera!\u00a0 \n24-75mm f\/2.8 \nIt\u2019s a zoom lens, with a focal length range of 24 - 75mm. As I said, if I multiply these numbers by 1.6, I get the equivalent for a cropped camera which is 39 - 120mm. \u00a0You can see by doing this just how differently this lens will perform on a full frame or a cropped frame camera!\u00a0You will also note it only has one F number - that is because you can use F2.8 throughout the whole focal range \u2013 it doesn\u2019t change as you zoom in and out. \u00a0This is called a fixed aperture zoom.\u00a0 \n\nIt can take a little while to get your head around the numbers, so I hope this helped a bit with learning what the lens numbers mean and how to decide whether the lens is right for you. \n\nPlease note there is a lot more technical mathematical stuff to it than that, \u00a0but I think as long as we know what we can do with the lens once it\u2019s on our camera, that\u2019s all we really need to know! \n\nHope some of you just starting out have found this helpful.\u00a0","title":"What do the numbers on your lens mean?","media-type":"Blog","source":"Live Snap Love with Audrey Ann","published":"2015-09-03T14:55:00Z"}

She made her Grand Slam debut after recently turning pro. \n\nAfter Wozniacki's win, seeded women were just 12-9 so far. Add in Maria Sharapova's withdrawal, and 10 of the 32 seeds are already out before the second round. \n\nJust four seeded women's players lost in the first round last year. Since the tournament started seeding 32 players in 2000, the largest number of women's seeds to lose in the opening round was 10 in 2012. \n\nSixth-seeded Lucie Safarova, who was upset earlier Tuesday, said she was bothered by a strained abdominal muscle on her right side that she hurt in losing the New Haven final Saturday. Safarova is pulling out of doubles, where she and American Bethanie Mattek-Sands would have been among the favorites after winning the Australian and French Opens this year. \n\n___ \n\n12:15 p.m. \n\nHalf of the top 10 seeds in the women's draw are already out of the U.S. Open. \n\nThe second day of the tournament started just like the first, with sixth-seeded Lucie Safarova the one getting upset this time. The French Open runner-up had a tough first-round matchup against 37th-ranked Lesia Tsurenko and lost 6-4, 6-1 in just 65 minutes Tuesday. \n\nSeventh-seeded Ana Ivanovic, eighth-seeded Karolina Pliskova and 10th-seeded Carla Suarez Navarro were all eliminated Monday, a day after third-seeded Maria Sharapova withdrew because of a leg injury. \n\nSafarova had defeated Tsurenko in straight sets in New Haven just four days earlier. She went on to lose a three-setter to Petra Kvitova in the title match Saturday. \n\nTsurenko had been playing well on the hard courts this summer to reach a career-best ranking this week. The 26-year-old from Ukraine upset Pliskova to make the New Haven semis, where she fell to Safarova. Before that, she upset Wimbledon runner-up Garbine Muguruza in advancing to the quarterfinals in Toronto. \n\nThe U.S. Open is the only major tournament at which Safarova has never reached the quarterfinals. The Czech lefty took Serena Williams to three sets in the French Open final. \n\nSecond-seeded Simona Halep avoided the upset bug Tuesday, moving on in 47 minutes when Marina Erakovic retired in the second set. Halep was leading 6-2, 3-0. \n\nThat adds to the seven retirements Monday, which the ITF said matched the Open era record for the most in one day at a major.","title":"Latest on US Open: Wozniacki avoids upset, wins 1st match","media-type":"News","source":"Boston Herald","published":"2015-09-01T18:38:01Z"}

{"id":"9af69428-4ecb-4a01-b00b-ad5b07b8b986","content":"Penn State, Temple and Delaware all finished the regular season at 6-6 last season. Penn State and Temple both seem to be on the rise, while the Blue Hens would probably consider remaining around .500 a successful season. \n \nBut either the Owls or Nittany Lions will start their season with a loss. The teams square off Saturday (3:30 p.m.) at Lincoln Financial Field. \n \nVillanova is the first local team to take the field. The Wildcats open their season at Connecticut on Thursday (7:30 p.m.). It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if the Wildcats again had the best record of any of the local teams. \n \nRay Priore replaces Al Bagnoli, who left Penn after 23 years as head coach, and finds the cupboard relatively bare in terms of experienced standout players. A .500 record for Penn would be a monumental achievement. \n \nTo summarize: another .500 regular-season record would be a disappointment for Penn State or Temple. It would be acceptable at Delaware, a big step in the right direction at Penn and a bitter disappointment for Villanova. \n \nThe following is a preview of Penn State, Temple, Villanova, Delaware and Penn for the 2015 season. \n \nPENN STATE \n \nHead coach: James Franklin, 2 nd season at Penn State \n \nLast year\u2019s record: 7-6, 2-6 Big 10 \n \nSeason opener: Saturday (3:30 p.m.) at Temple (at Lincoln Financial Field) \n \nThe Nittany Lions hope to carry the momentum from a 31-30 overtime victory over Boston College in the New Era Pinstripe Bowl at Yankee Stadium into this season. The top weapon is junior quarterback Christian Hackenberg, but the key for Hackenberg may be the offensive line. \n \nOne reason Hackenberg threw more interceptions (15) than touchdowns (12) last season \u2013 he head 20 touchdown passes and 10 interceptions as a freshman \u2013 was that he was constantly under pressure. Penn State allowed 44 sacks last season. The Nittany Lions return much more experience this season. The downside is that the team\u2019s best lineman, left tackle Donovan Smith, left for the NFL Draft, where he was selected 34 th overall by the Buccaneers. His replacement is Paris Palmer (6-foot-7, 302 pounds). \n \nThe offensive line also will try to open holes for Akeel Lynch (147 carries for 703 yards), who must carry more of the load due to the graduation of Bill Belton and Zach Zwinak. \n \nIf Hackenberg has time to throw, his top target should be DaeSean Hamilton (82 catches for 899 yards). Chris Godwin, Geno Lewis and DeAndre Thompkins round out an increasingly deep receiving corps. \n \nPenn State\u2019s strength last season was its defense. Defensive end Deion Barnes (Jets) and linebacker Mike Hull (Dolphins) signed with NFL teams, but the defense should still be terrific. Anthony Zettel and Austin Johnson form one of the best defensive tackle tandems, with Zettel (6-foot-4, 284 pounds) providing quickness that disrupts plays in the backfield and Johnson (6-4, 323) providing more size and power. Nyeem Wartman-White and Brandon Bell ad the linebacking corps. The secondary looks promising, with senior Jordan Lucas at strong safety and senior Trevor Williams at cornerback. Sophomore Marcus Allen starts at free safety, with sophomore Grant Haley lining up as the other starting cornerback. \n \nThe Lions may miss Sam Ficken, who made game-winning kicks in the season-opening win over Central Florida in Ireland and in the season-ending New Era Pinstripe Bowl. \n \nPrediction: Penn State opens the season against Temple and then plays five straight home games. When the Nittany Lions travel to Ohio State on Oct. 17, it will be their first game outside of Pennsylvania. The defense should remain terrific and the offense should be better. 9-3 overall, 5-3 in Big 10 \n \nTEMPLE \n \nHead coach: Matt Rhule, 3 rd season as Temple\u2019s head coach \n \nLast year\u2019s record: 6-6, 4-4 American Athletic Conference \n \nSeason opener: Saturday (3:30 p.m.) vs Penn State \n \nDefense should be the Owls\u2019 strength. Eleven starters return from last year\u2019s defense, which ranked fourth in the FBS last season in scoring defense. Senior linebacker Tyler Matakevich has registered more than 100 tackles in each of his three seasons. Senior defensive end Praise Martin-Oguike and senior defensive tackle Matt Ioannidis anchor the defense line. The secondary is led by senior Tavon Young and sophomore Sean Chandler. \n \nThe Owls could have more balance this year because junior quarterback P.J. Walker should have better weapons at his disposal, including a pair of 6-foot-3, 190-pound receivers. Robby Anderson, who caught 44 passes for 791 yards and nine touchdowns two year ago before sitting out last season with academic issues, returns to the team. Pittsburgh transfer Adonis Jennings provides another big target. \n \nAfter throwing 20 touchdowns and eight interceptions in nine games as a freshman, Walker regressed last season, throwing 13 touchdowns and 15 interceptions in 12 games. \n \nRunning back Jahad Thomas could help Walker by providing balance to the offense, which would allow the offense to provide balance on the team. \n \nPrediction: The Owls climbed to .500 last season, improving four games from a 2-10 campaign two seasons ago. With their outstanding defense intact, the Owls could take a big step forward this season. We may find out a lot about the Owls during the first four games of their season. They open Saturday against Penn State, then face American Athletic Conference favorite Cincinnati on the road the follow week. The Owls play two more games on the road, against UMass and Charlotte, before returning home. If the Owls can win one of their first two games and avoid slipping up against UMass and Charlotte, Temple will be in position to make some noise this season. Record: 8-4 \n \nVILLANOVA \n \nHead coach: Andy Talley, 31st year as Villanova\u2019s head coach \n \nLast year\u2019s record: 11-3, 7-1 Colonial Athletic Conference \n \nSeason opener: Thursday (7:30 p.m.), at Connecticut \n \nThe Wildcats have something they didn\u2019t have last season during their 34-31 loss to Sam Houston State in the quarterfinals of the FBS playoffs: John Robertson. The dual-threat quarterback threw 35 touchdown passes and just three interceptions while completing 65.4 percent of his passes for 2,846 yards last season. Robertson also rushed for 1,078 yards. Robertson won the Walter Payton Award as the FCS offensive player of the year, but he missed the quarterfinal game due to a concussion. \n \nRobertson is back, but leading rusher Kevin Monangai, who was released by the Eagles earlier this week, is gone, as is leading receiver Poppy Libers (67 catches for 987 yards, 9 TDs) and a pair of all-conference offensive linemen. Senior Gary Underwood (344 yards), who missed part of last season with a knee injury, appears likely to step into a starting role. Receiver Kevin Gulyas (27 receptions, 677 yards, 9 TDs) provides Robertson with another weapon. \n \nSenior linebacker Don Cherry \u2013 no, not the bad jacket-wearing former head coach and hockey broadcaster \u2013 paced the Wildcats last season with 134 tackles, 56 more than the next0-highest Villanova total. Another defender to watch is defensive lineman Tanoh Kpassagnon, although it\u2019s hard to miss his 6-foot-7, 275-pound frame. Defensive back Jack Ceneus led the Wildcats in interceptions last season with five. \n \nPrediction: The Wildcats\u2019 three losses last season were by a combined five points, including a 10-9 loss at Richmond and a season-opening double-overtime loss at Syracuse. The loss of several key players may force Villanova to take a step backward, but the Wildcats still have Robertson and could return to the playoffs. Record: 8-3. \n \nDELAWARE \n \nHead coach: Dave Brock, 3 rd year as Delaware\u2019s head coach \n \nLast year\u2019s record: 6-6, 4-4 CAA \n \nSeason opener: Friday (7 p.m.) vs. Jacksonville \n \nThree-year starting quarterback Trent Hurley is gone, as is top receiver Michael Johnson (78 receptions for 830 yards). Tight end Nick Boyle, who caught 42 and 37 passes the past two seasons, also does not return. \n \nOn the positive side, the Blue Hens return their top two running backs, Wes Hills (172 carries for 979 yards, 6 TDs) and Jalen Randolph (121 carries for 668 yards, 2 TDs). The running game should take some pressure off the quarterback, whether that be junior Blake Rankin or redshirt freshman Joe Walker, neither of whom have taken a snap in a college game. \n \nDelaware gave up far too many points for the second straight year. Sophomore defensive tackle Blaine Woodson, last year\u2019s Colonial Athletic Association Defensive Rookie of the Year, hopes to change that equation. \n \nPrediction: There are only seven seniors on this year\u2019s team. An inexperienced team with a new quarterback isn\u2019t a good combination. The Blue Hens lost one more game last year than the year before. That trend could continue this season. Record: 5-6. \n \nPENN \n \nHead coach: Ray Priore, 1 st year as Penn\u2019s head coach \n \nLast year\u2019s record: 2-8, 2-6 Ivy \n \nSeason opener: Sept. 19 (1 p.m.), at Jacksonville \n \nThe big news is that Ray Priore takes over as head coach for Al Bagnoli, who spent 23 seasons as Quakers head coach. He takes over a team that went 2-8 last season, a disappointing record a senior-leaden team trying to give its long-time head coach a big sendoff. \n \nAs always, it\u2019s difficult to get a good read on the Quakers. Unlike the other teams in this preview, all of whom start their seasons this week, Penn doesn\u2019t start its season for several more weeks. \n \nJunior Alek Torgerson, who averaged 42 passes per game last season, completed 61.8 percent of his passes, throwing 14 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. Torgerson\u2019s job would be made easier if the Quakers could run the ball. Penn\u2019s top rusher last season gained just 222 yards. Torgerson will be without his top two targets last season, Spencer Kulcsar and Conner Scott. Sophomore receiver Justin Watson (23 catches, 497 yards, 2 TDs) returns. \n \nSenior defensive end Tyler Drake (6 sacks) and senior defensive tackle Dan Connaughton anchor the defensive line. They also are captains, along with senior tight end Ryan O\u2019Maley. \n \nPrediction: This could be a long year for the young Quakers. If you\u2019re looking for a game to circle on the calendar, it would be Oct. 17 at Columbia. In a surprising move, Bagnoli took over perennial doormat Columbia after leaving Penn. Record: 2-8.","title":"Football kicks off","media-type":"Blog","source":"Philly Phanatics - THE online community for Philly sports fanatics","published":"2015-09-03T02:13:37Z"}

Some of the other Spanish and Italian consortia will come over to participate in the plethora of business here.\u201d \n \nNeither SBG or Saudi Oger secured a place on the three consortia that were appointed to build the $23 billion, six-line Riyadh Metro project two years ago, which instead went to groups led by US, Italian and Spanish contracting giants partnering with smaller Saudi contractors. The \u20ac2.3bn (Dh9.49bn) Mecca Metro contract awarded in July also went to a Spanish-led consortium. \n\nMr Smith said that SBG may now look to other markets like the UAE and Egypt to secure new business. \n \n\u201cThey have reach and they have potential. If you were not well received at home and you wanted to stay in this industry you would go to markets where there is business.\u201d \n\nColin Timmons, general manager of the UAE-based Al Fara\u2019a General Contracting, said that if SBG were to attempt to push into the UAE market, it would not find it to be an easy prospect. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not something we would fear. The market is already difficult here. One more Saudi contractor probably won\u2019t impact. \n \n\u201cThey\u2019d be coming into a market with a surplus of hungry contractors \u2013 certainly in Dubai.\u201d \n\nAccording to a recent report by Ventures Onsite for The Big 5 construction trade show, Saudi Arabia remains the GCC\u2019s biggest construction market. Of the $193.65bn of contract awards expected this year, 44 per cent are expected to be made in the kingdom. \n\nHowever, it is a difficult market for contractors to break into. Securing visas and Saudisation requirements are frequently touted as barriers to entry. \n \nDuring a recent interview, Mark Andrews, Middle East managing director of contractor Laing O\u2019Rourke, said that it was looking at expansion into other GCC markets like Oman but added that \u201cit would have to be something special\u201d for it to create a base in Saudi Arabia. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of work there, but it\u2019s a very tough place for contractors.\u201d \n\nmfahy@thenational.ae \n\n\n\nFollow The National\u2019s Business section on Twitter","title":"Saudi Binladin suspension may clear path for other major contractors\u2019 entry into kingdom","media-type":"News","source":"Abu Dhabi National","published":"2015-09-16T15:34:47Z"}

The Millennium Stadium is to be renamed the Principality Stadium from January 2016 after a 10-year sponsorship deal was announced.

The scanner I use does. \n \nHowever, what happens when you have multiple PDFs that really should go in one document? How do you combine PDFs together? \n \nThere are a million ways to do this, including some I have talked about before like using Preview.app to drag and drop pages , and there are lots of applications that one can use to combine PDFs, but I wanted to do something that would be: \n  Already built into the OS and not require any additional software.  Easy to use.  Repeatable so I only have to set it up once and can use it again and again.   \nWe\u2019re going to use a Mac OS X tool called Automator to set this up. If you have seen my How to Split PDFs tutorial, this is basically the reverse. \n Start Automator  \nIn Finder, go to Applications and then start Automator . \n Choose Service  \nIn the window that pops up, highlight Service and then hit Choose . \n  \n Automator Choose Service   Set The Variable For The Original PDFs  \nAt the top of the window at the right, change the Service receives selected dropdown to PDF files . I set the in dropdown to Finder.app . I haven\u2019t tested it in other applications. \n \nNow in the Library section on the left, click on Utilities and then find Set Value of Variable . Drag it to the main window on the right. \n \n\n \nIn the Variable dropdown, choose New variable\u2026 and call it originalPDFs . \n \nHere\u2019s what the first rule looks like so far. \n \n\n Set The Variable For The Path Of The PDF  \nWe are doing this step because of a weird way Automator works. It doesn\u2019t make it easy to save the resulting PDF to the same folder as the original. \n \nI could prompt the user to choose a path, but I wanted to make it automatic so we have to get a bit geeky. \n \nNote: if you\u2019re an Automator expert and know a better way to do this, please leave a comment! \n \nStill in the Utilities section of the Library on the left, find Run AppleScript . Drag it to the main window under our last step. \n \nIn the Run AppleScript window, paste in this code: \n \n\non run {input, parameters} \nset pathList to {} \nrepeat with itemNum from 1 to count of input \ntell application \"System Events\" \ncopy POSIX path of (container of (item itemNum of input)) to end of pathList \nend tell \nend repeat \nreturn pathList \nend run \n  \n \n(Basically that is going through the PDFs that you are splitting and copying the folders that they are stored in.) \n \nNow in the Utilities section of the Library , find our old friend Set Value of Variable and (you guessed it) drag it into the main window under our last step. \n \nIn the Variable dropdown, choose New Variable\u2026 and give your new variable a name of containerPath . \n \nHere\u2019s what these steps look like: \n \n\n Combine The PDFs  \nNow it\u2019s time to do the combining! \n \nFirst, we want to get the list of PDFs that we had saved back in the first step. \n \nIn Library -> Utilities , drag Get Value of Variable to the main window under our last step. \n \nIn the Variable dropdown, choose originalPDFs . \n \nRight under the Variable dropdown there is an Options button. Hit that and check Ignore this action\u2019s input . \n \nNow in Library on the right, choose PDFs . Find Combine PDF Pages and drag it under the last step. \n \nNext, in Library on the right, choose Files & Folders . Find Rename Finder Items and drag it under the last step. It will pop up a message asking you if you want to preserve an extra copy. We don\u2019t need that, so hit Don\u2019t Add . \n \nIn the Rename Finder Items box, change the dropdown to Name Single Item . Then hit the Options button and check Show this action when the workflow runs . This will let name the new PDF. \n \nNext, also in Files & Folders , drag Move Finder Items under the last step. In the Variable window at the bottom of your screen, find your containerPath variable. Drag it up on top of the To dropdown. \n \nHere is what those last steps look like: \n  \n Combine PDFs   Save The Service  \nAlright! You\u2019re done! Here\u2019s the entire rule (click to see it bigger): \n \n\n \nGo to File > Save and give your new service a name. I\u2019ll call mine Combine PDFs . \n Use The Combine PDFs Service  \nYou have just created a Service. This means that if you right-click a group of PDFs in the Finder, you can combine them right from there. Let\u2019s try it. \n \nFind a group of PDFs on your Mac, highlight them, and right-click. Choose the Services menu near the bottom. If all went well, you should see Combine PDFs (or whatever you called your Service) in the list. Choose it. \n  \n Combine Mac Service Right-Click   \nIt will think for a moment and then pop up a box where you can give the new PDF a name. I just called mine \u201cCombined\u201d. \n  \n Combine Mac PDF Give Name   \nBoom. I now have a PDF called Combined.pdf that contains all the selected PDFs. \n  \n Mac PDF Combined   \nBest of all, since I went through this trouble to set it up as a Service, going forward whenever I need to combine PDFs, I just have to right-click on them. \n Downloading The Service  \nIf you don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of setting this all up, you are welcome to use mine. \n \nTo use it, download the file to your computer and double-click it to Unzip it. \n \nYou want to move the file to the ~\/Library\/Services folder. It\u2019s probably hidden for you, so the easiest way to get there is: \n  Go to a Finder window  Choose the Go menu and then Go to Folder\u2026  Type or paste in ~\/Library\/Services   \nOnce that window opens up, drag the CombinePDF.workflow file there. \n \nClick Here To Download CombinePDF20.zip \n \nThis article was originally written in August 2010.

Easley\nCarmen Wampler-Collins, left, and her partner Shannon Wampler-Collins speak with the media on the lawn of the Rowan County Judicial Center in Morehead, Ky. Monday, Sept. 14, 2015. The couple received their marriage license following Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis\u2019 announcement earlier that her office will issue marriage licenses under order of a federal judge, but they will not have her name or office listed.\nAttorneys representing the couples who sued clerk Kim Davis over her refusal to issue marriage licenses are concerned that the altered forms Davis\u2019 deputies issued could be invalid. Davis, on her first day back at work after a five-day stint in jail, announced on Monday that she would not block her deputies from issuing licenses. But she insisted they be edited to exclude her name and her title. The forms, a template issued by the state, now read, \u201cpursuant to federal court order\u201d in the spaces meant to list Davis\u2019 position. Lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union say they \u201chave concerns about the validity,\u201d given the alterations and said they were reviewing their legal options. Kentucky\u2019s governor says the altered marriage licenses issued in Rowan County from the office of an embattled clerk are considered valid. Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear insists the licenses issued \u201care going to be recognized as valid in the Commonwealth.\u201d Kentucky state law requires that \u201cevery license blank shall contain the identical words and figures.\u201d But Beshear noted that the federal judge overseeing Davis\u2019 case has not raised any objections to the licenses. The Republican president of Kentucky\u2019s state Senate again called for a special session of the state legislature to change state law to exempt Davis and others who share her beliefs from jabbing to issue licenses. But Beshear again rejected that on Monday. A lawyer for Kim Davis says the paperwork now going out from her office could be a solution in the matter. Lawyer Harry Mihet said Monday at a news conference: \u201cThe license that went out today does not violate Kim Davis\u2019s conscience. If it\u2019s satisfactory to the \u2026 court, then I think we will have found that win-win solution that we have been asking for all along.\u201d Davis says the licenses are issued without her authority. She herself has questioned their validity. \u00a9 2015, Associated Press, All Rights Reserved.\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

{"id":"03ef7960-2ea9-4911-850d-d3d1b5e50260","content":"Researchers reveal that, under certain circumstances, the process of evolution can be highly predictable, especially when animals evolve resistance to dangerous toxins A research paper that was published a few days ago in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reports that evolution can follow predictable pathways when available solutions to a particular problem are severely limited. This new study found that resistance to heart-stopping cardiac glycoside toxins produced by some plants and animals for defensive purposes has independently converged across several lineages of insects, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals, after following a highly predictable evolutionary pathway. \n\nMost Australian goannas die after snacking on cane toads \n\nGoannas are a group of carnivorous monitor lizards in the genus Varanus. Almost all goannas live in Australia, but a few species can also be found Africa and southeast Asia. Goannas are not picky eaters -- they are predatory as well as scavengery -- and will eat any animal that they can fit down their throats. So goannas would appear to be impervious to most threats. But problems started for Australia\u2019s goannas after people introduced the cane toad to northern Australia in 1935.\n\nThe cane toad, Rhinella marina, is the largest of the Bufonidae toads, with adults weighing an average of 1.8 kilograms (4 pounds). This toad is native to Central and South America, where it is known for its voracious appetite and fondness for beetles. In an effort to control several beetle species that were feasting upon the popular sugarcane crop, this toad was introduced into a number of locations in northern Australia. \n\nUnfortunately, incomplete knowledge of the natural history of this toad, and of the beetles it was supposed to control, proved disastrous: the toads did not eat the pesky beetles, which wisely lived in the tops of the sugarcane, for out of the reach of the lumbering toads. But the cane toad introduction did prove wildly successful -- for the cane toads. So successful was it that these animals are moving inland from where they were introduced, and everywhere they pop up, they compete effectively with native wildlife for food and other resources, whilst spreading diseases.\n\nBut more damaging is that cane toads are poisonous at all stages of their life cycle -- eggs, tadpoles, toadlets and adult toads are all toxic. Cane toads have poison glands (parotoid glands) located behind their ears, and the toads release this poison when threatened. If an animal attempts to swallow the toad, its poison causes a rapid heartbeat, excessive salivation, convulsions and paralysis -- and it ultimately kills its victim. \n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Deadly last meal: a goanna and a cane toad. Photograph: Beata Ujvari et al\/PNAS 2015 Needless to say, poisonous and invasive cane toads pose a huge problem for Australia\u2019s native predators (doi:10.1071\/WR04040). For example, native goanna populations have plummeted by as much as 90 percent after cane toads arrived. Since cane toads are steadily marching across northern Australia, the strategy has become one of documenting the inevitable population collapses that follow, and developing methods for reducing the damages to the native wildlife.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to investigate how the goanna population will collapse once the toads reached our study site, and we were curious whether the goanna population would recover from such a population crash\u201d, said evolutionary ecologist Beata Ujvari, a Senior Research Fellow at Deakin University and a Senior Honorary Fellow in the Faculty of Veterinary Science at the University of Sydney. Dr Ujvari co-led the research team with colleague, Nickolas Casewell, a Lecturer at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.\n\nWhen the toads reached their study site in 2005, the goanna population collapsed, as predicted, plummeting from more than 200 animals to fewer than five or ten individuals. \n\n\u201cAdditionally, we wanted to understand why Australian goannas are so sensitive to toad toxins, compared to other goannas living in Asia and Africa\u201d, said Dr Ujvari in email.\n\n\u201cAsian and African goannas regularly feed on toads and don\u2019t die from their toxins. Therefore we decided to investigate the evolution of the gene which provides resistance to toad toxins in certain animals\u201d, said Dr Ujvari.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nick Casewell and a goanna eye each other uneasily. Photograph: Beata Ujvari et al\/PNAS 2015 How some goannas can eat poisonous cane toads and survive \n\nThis study tracks the molecular pathway followed by a wide variety of unrelated animals as they all converged onto the same solution to an old problem: resistance to cardiac glycoside toxins.\n\nCardiac glycosides are a group of steroids produced by some plants, such as foxglove (digoxin), and animals, such as toads (bufadienolides), and milkweed butterflies (cardenolides). When consumed, cardiac glycosides can stop the heart from beating. These substances act by specifically binding to proteins embedded in cell membranes known as the sodium-potassium exchange pump (Na+\/K+-ATPase). When cardiac glycosides bind to these exchange pumps, they stop the pumps\u2019 function. When these pumps stop working, sodium ions rapidly build up inside cells. This increased concentration of intracellular sodium triggers a build-up of calcium ions, which escalates cardiac output by increasing the force of each heartbeat -- until the cardiac muscles stop contracting altogether.\n\nAlthough cardiac glycosides are toxic to animals across the entire animal kingdom, a variety of animals have evolved resistance to them. For example, snakes and lizards have evolved resistance to frog toxins that results from just two, very specific, amino acid changes in the structure of their sodium-potassium exchange pumps. According to Dr Ujvari and Dr Casewell\u2019s research team, these identical changes have occurred on at least four separate occasions, in three unrelated groups of snakes and in varanid lizards (note the four toad icons in Figure 1):\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fig. 1. Convergent molecular evolution of resistance to toad toxins in squamate reptiles and reversal to susceptibility in Australian varanid lizards. Illustration: Beata Ujvari et al (2015)\/Beata Ujvari et al (2015) Toxin resistance arose in snakes as the result of the same amino acid changes in their sodium-potassium exchange pump proteins -- leucine (L) at position 111 and arginine (R) at position 120 -- despite the fact that snakes diverged from lizards more than 165 million years ago. These replacements were previously shown to confer resistance to toad toxins in African and Asian varanid lizards (doi:10.1111\/j.1558-5646.2012.01751.x ).\n\nThese animo acid substitutions result from point mutations at just two key positions in the structure of one protein component, the \u03b13 subunit. These animo acid replacements significantly reduce the ability of cardiac glycosides from binding to, and thereby inhibiting, the action of the sodium-potassium exchange pump. Thus, these point mutations render these animals resistant to the toxic effects of cardiac glycosides.\n\n\u201cBottom line: This means that reptiles have found the exact same solution to evolving resistance to toad toxins on four separate occasions\u201d, said Dr Casewell in email.\n\nEven in unrelated animals, evolution of toxin resistance followed a predictable pathway \n\nWhen Dr Ujvari and Dr Casewell\u2019s team widened their investigation to include all 47 taxa that are resistant to cardiac glycosides (whether it was from a plant or an animal source), they found that resistance was due to two amino acid substitutions at just four positions: 111, 119, 120, or 122. Further, the team found that, of the 11 amino acids within this portion of the sodium-potassium exchange pump subunit, one specific amino acid site (111) must always change for resistance to evolve, whereas the second resistance-conferring change then occurs in one of three other amino acid sites (119, 120, or 122), which varies across species (Figure 2):\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fig. 2. Cross-phyla molecular convergence in the H1\u2013H2 extracellular domain of the \u03b1 Na+\/K+-ATPase resulting in resistance to cardiac glycosides. Illustration: Beata Ujvari et al (2015)\/Beata Ujvari et al (2015) Therefore, across the tree of life, an incredible diversity of animal lineages evolved resistance to cardiac glycoside toxins by following very similar molecular pathways. \n\n\u201c[In addition to] snakes all having identical resistance-conferring changes, rodents and frogs and, separately, hedgehogs and toads, have identical resistant changes despite these animal groups having been separated from one another for over 300 million years\u201d, said Dr Casewell.\n\nWhether the the sodium-potassium exchange pump is vulnerable to cardiac glycoside toxins depends upon whether the toxins can bind to the pump proteins. When the pump proteins include amino acids with higher electrical charge at key positions, the toxin is repelled and therefore cannot bind nor block the action of the pump.\n\nSo the researchers measured the isoelectric point for the sodium-potassium exchange pumps of resistant and susceptible animals. Comparisons of the isoelectric point for each of the pump protein subunits indicated that specific sorts of amino acid changes occurred: every resistant species has a corresponding increase in isoelectric point (blue and green regions in figure 3) when compared to toxin-susceptible species (red and orange regions in figure 3):\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fig. 3. Convergent evolution of animal resistance to cardiac glycosides is mediated by changes in the isoelectric point of the H1\u2013H2 extracellular domain of the \u03b1 Na+\/K+-ATPase. Illustration: Beata Ujvari et al (2015)\/Beata Ujvari et al (2015) Thus, the research team concluded that evolution of toxin-resistance predominately results after a \u201ccharged\u201d amino acid replaces a neutral amino acid in just a few key positions in the sodium-potassium exchange pump protein -- a change that appears crucial for the evolution of cardiac glycoside resistance, irrespective of the type of animal that evolved this resistance.\n\nEvolution is random but it can follow a highly predictable molecular pathway \n\n\u201cThroughout my education, I was taught that evolution follows a more or less random pattern, and is rarely predictable,\u201d said Dr Ujvari. \u201cI was surprised to find such a clear pattern of predictable evolution across the entire animal kingdom.\u201d\n\nThis study revealed that a wide variety of unrelated animals -- insects, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals -- can evolve the same solution to a specific problem in parallel. \n\n\u201cThe repeatability of this process demonstrates that evolution can proceed along highly predictable paths at the molecular level,\u201d said Dr Ujvari. \u201cOur case study has important implications for conservation biology, by providing a simple predictive framework for assessing the potential vulnerability of native fauna to the introduction of toxic invasive species.\u201d\n\nAustralian goannas originated in Asia, so their ancestors were originally resistant to cardiac glycoside toxins. However, after they moved to Australia, they lost their resistance roughly 30 million years ago (see the toad with a slash through it in the lower part of Figure 1). \n\n\u201cAustralia is a toad free continent (or at least it was before the introduction of the cane toads) hence goannas living in Australia did not need to have a toad toxin resistant structure, and hence they have reverted back to the physiologically more efficient structure, which unfortunately also means that they became sensitive to cane toad toxin,\u201d said Dr Ujvari.\n\nThus, what was a beneficial mutation in Africa and Asia became detrimental in Australia where this toxin was absent.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Beata Ujvari holds a goanna that has been restrained with tape. Photograph: Beata Ujvari et al (2015) Dr Ujvari and her team are still monitoring the Australian goanna population after it collapsed in 2005 when the cane toads reached their study site. \n\n\u201cWe are currently investigating the genetic effects of the population collapse, and trying to establish whether the population collapse has resulted in loss of population genetic variation,\u201d said Dr Ujvari. She noted that a loss in genetic variation may make the few remaining goannas vulnerable to other challenges, such as parasites.\n\nBut apart from toxin resistance, this research has much broader implications for ecology, conservation biology, evolution -- and even for medicine.\n\n\u201cMy research has recently been focusing on how animals cope with cancer, how do they avoid getting cancer and once they have cancer, how do they cope with it\u201d, said Dr Ujvari.\n\n\u201cIn short I am particularly interested in the ecology and evolution of cancer from both the disease point of view and also from the organism\u2019s point of view\u201d, explained Dr Ujvari. \n\n\u201cWe aim to study whether the evolution of certain tumour suppressor, oncogenes or immune genes follow predictable paths which would help animals to counteract the detrimental effect of cancer.\u201d\n\nSource: \n\nBeata Ujvaria, Nicholas R.

They were elected on Sept. 8. Also sworn in were Linda Hayes, who\u00a0had been\u00a0appointed to fill the\u00a0unexpired term of late board member Bill Sherwood, and veteran board member\u00a0Ralph Johanson,\u00a0who won voter approval in last week's election. \n\nJohanson was re-elected board president; Richard Clewell was re-elected\u00a0vice president. \n\nBoard members expressed confidence the new board can successfully address the district's most prominent issues, including state funding, student achievement gap and the future of J.B. Young\u00a0K-8 School. \n\nDeFauw, who school board members credited\u00a0with playing the important role of devil's advocate, summarized her sentiments in a closing statement. \n\n\"Just as students in Davenport are not worth-less, no student body within the district is worth less than any other and all deserve equal educational and enrichment opportunities,\" she said. \n\nBefore\u00a0the meeting, DeSalvo, a customer service manager at MidAmerican Energy, and Gosa, a local union insulator and father of two at Fillmore Elementary, both\u00a0said their mission\u00a0is to fight school funding inequality in Iowa. \n\nDeSalvo, a mother of a Davenport North High School junior, has fought to bring attention to the disparities\u00a0in the way Iowa funds school districts. \n \n\"I know there's a lot of work ahead of us, but I'm here to help our students,\" added DeSalvo, who hopes to push a funding bill through the Iowa Legislature. \n\nKrumwiede, who worked for more than 40 years in the district as a teacher and principal, challenged the new board to continue advocating for funding equality\u00a0throughout the state. \n\n\"School boards need to work together across Iowa to make a difference for our kids,\" he said. \n\n\"We're never going to make a change with this funding unless we have other boards involved.\" \n\nIn other business, the board unanimously approved plans for a new secure entrance at Central High School, in addition to a new elevator to comply with Americans with Disabilities Act standards. The\u00a0project will relocate the main public entrance to the north side of the building and create a secure entryway. It is expected to be completed by the beginning of the 2016-17 school year. \n\nBoard members also\u00a0unanimously extended Superintendent Art Tate's contract to June 30, 2018, and approved\u00a0an annual base salary of $203,761.","title":"Davenport School Board seats newly-elected members","media-type":"News","source":"QC Times","published":"2015-09-15T10:20:00Z"}

Even for years before that, Innis Arden and its previous incarnations owned rights to use the property. That easement severely diminishes the sticker price of the parcel. Realistically, no private owner could build anything on the plot unless the golf course sold off its easement, which it does not appear willing to do, according to city officials. \n\nBut were the golf course itself to obtain the land, the easement would dissolve into simple ownership of the entire parcel, instead of just rights to most of it. The club is offering $110,000, which lawyers for the city say is the real value of the land with the easement in place. Minus the right of way, it would be worth twice that. \n\nWaterside residents whose parcels abut the sliver of land said that city officials rushed the land deal through the gears of government without taking their views into consideration. \n\nCity and golf course officials argued in turn that the land sale is the most prudent move with the most benefit to the city as a whole. \n\n\u201cThis contract for the sale of this property is a win-win-win,\u201d said Michael Cacace, an attorney for the golf club. \n\nCacace argued that the city gets some cash up front and tax revenue every year, it gets rid of possible liability and the golf course promises not to stash heavy equipment, a possibility which had worried the neighbors. \n\nThe city also maintains that a sale to the golf course is the most responsible course. \n\n\u201cInnis Arden, they have the easement, which prevents us from building on it,\u201d said Director of Administration Michael Handler. \u201cThe only two parties that have an interest in it are the city and Innis Arden \u2026 if no one else can build on it or use it, they\u2019re the only logical buyer.\u201d \n\nJos\u00e9 Mujica, whose father Hugo lives at 597 Fairfield Ave., finds at least the liability argument disingenuous. \n\n\u201cNobody has ever gotten hurt here,\u201d he proclaimed. \n\nHis neighbor, Alex Klumac, added that less than a half acre of land is miniscule compared to the amount of land the city owns and for which it also carries liability. \n\nThe Mujicas, the Klumacs and other families who live along the strip of city-owned land have been maintaining it. \n\nOn Wednesday, a group of the neighbors floated the idea of forming a limited liability company to try to buy the land and split the cost of the tax bill, though whether that is legally feasible is unclear.","title":"Stamford land deal sparks waterside neighborhood uprisingvisit|article-6482763|most_popular|6","media-type":"News","source":"Stamford Advocate","published":"2015-09-04T08:02:41Z"}

Gabrielle asks to come along on Xena's trips.\nWORDCOUNT: ~1300\n\nWritten for tigriswolf  at comment_fic . Prompt: Xena: Warrior Princess, Xena\/Gabrielle, Hogwarts AU \n\n\n---\n\nOutside the castle, Xena could believe that it was two years ago and she was still a Seventh Year at Hogwarts with a home waiting for her in the summer and a loving family that kept their owls busy with daily letters. She had been looking forward to joining her older brother's business, eager to start life as an adult despite the whispers of war and the nameless man rising as the new lord of darkness.\n\nBut Xena had been too young to care, when life had held so much for the most promising Gryffindor Head Girl since Lily Evans.\n\nThen it had happened.\n\nA ten-year-old boy and his father in a train station. A Muggle terrorist act against that place. A bomb. A fire. A broken family. Dozens had died, but the Muggles had had it coming, for their shortcomings handling their own trash. Only one had been worth grieving over.\n\nOnly the boy whose senseless death she'd sworn to avenge.\n\nLyceus's death had changed everything.\n\nAnd yet, two years later, she could almost pretend nothing had happened. Once again, Xena was back at Wizarding School, and yet again she was contemplating what her life would be like once she left this place behind.\n\n\"Hey!\"\n\nXena sighed. Not this girl again. She could try an invisibility spell, but Gabrielle would just run her down somewhere else. Hufflepuffs were supposed to be timid and at their best at social occasions, when they could rely on each other for support. Gabrielle had never been notified of the first, and as for the second, she seemed to believe that Xena was like her other friends.\n\nEven before her brief stint as a Death Eater, no one had mistaken Xena for the patient, supportive kind.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThe blonde stopped a few steps away, blinking her large blue eyes in confusion. \"But you don't know what I want.\"\n\n\"No,\" Xena repeated, \"you're not coming along with me after the Leaving Feast tomorrow.\"\n\nShe expected a pout. Perhaps a show of stubborn bravado. But the girl was a Hufflepuff, not a Gryffindor, so she sat down to chip away at the problem. Persistent lot, the 'Puffs. \"You won't go back to your town,\" she told Xena. \"You've been lying to everyone from Dumbledore to the Fat Lady.\"\n\nXena doubted the old professor was deceived at all. There was always that twinkle in his eye when he spoke of her new chance at freedom, and he had given her that vial of phoenix tears. But Gabrielle had no way to know that. \"You'll tell on me?\"\n\nThere was a reason everybody at Hogwarts avoided her, and it had little to do with the vile truth stamped on her left forearm. It was the way Xena saw all of them as potential victims, even if she wouldn't be their killer anymore, and no matter how many times Dumbledore had vouched for her in the last year, no one could look at her and dismiss the threat.\n\nExcept this girl.\n\n\"Of course not,\" Gabrielle said, and she even rolled her eyes at the idea. \"But you'll need help.\"\n\n\"I can manage.\"\n\nThe look on the younger girls' face verged on amusement. \"Your potions are a disaster, and all the fancy wand-work won't mean a thing if you can't convince people to trust you.\" Smiling with all the innocence in the world, she pointed at herself. \"I'm trustworthy. People like me.\"\n\n\"Right now, I really don't.\"\n\nThis time she did get a pout. \n\n\"It will be dangerous,\" Xena found herself saying what she hadn't admitted out loud to another soul. Perhaps the girl was right, and people couldn't wait to tell her their secrets. \"You can't sniff out Death Eaters just by shoving up their sleeves-\" she did as said, expecting Gabrielle to reel back in horror. The girl instead leaned in, curious as she took in the rough design marking Xena's skin. It was Xena who drew her arm away, covering it again with a sharp movement. \"His followers could be anywhere, and you don't want to cross them. Best case scenario, they'll hit you with an Unforgivable and perhaps have enough mercy to leave your body for your family to bury.\"\n\n\"And the worst?\"\n\n\"They'll tell their lord.\" \n\nXena closed her eyes, remembering the time she and others had been summoned to witness the execution of an Auror - and his entire family. There'd been a boy, a grandson. Younger than Lyceus had been. Xena had broken ranks to try to cover him. She'd been too late, of course, the green light had snuffed out the kid's life before she'd made more than two steps; but the others had known that she wasn't one of them anymore. In the beginning, she wondered why she hadn't died that night; later she'd realized they hadn't expected her to survive the barrel of Cruciatus they'd all put her under while their lord laughed at her foolishness. \n\nNightmares often came with that laughter in the background. \n\nXena fisted her hands in order to repress a shiver. \"You don't want Voldemort to be aware of your existence.\"\n\nGabrielle did cringe at that name, but she didn't ask that Xena refrained from mentioning it.\n\nBrave girl.\n\n\"He's aware of yours,\" she pointed out.\n\n\"Because I practically begged him to take me in.\" \n\nAnother thing very few people knew. Most were taken by the idea of a powerful young witch grieving a beloved brother's death, and the dark lord who'd taken advantage of her moment of weakness to add her to his forces. It delighted them to believe that the true strength of a Gryffindor's character had shone through in the end, and that she'd walked away because it was the right thing to do. \n\nIn that tale, there was no place for the regrets tearing at her, or even a hint of the ever-present temptation to heed the calling from the Mark and return to the winning side.\n\nThe people needed their heroes, Dumbledore had explained, so Xena had kept her head low and let everybody think as they would. They feared and respected her. That meant that she would never be welcomed with smiles and open arms. but they hadn't locked her up in Azkaban.\n\nThat had been enough. More than she'd expected, really.\n\nBut Gabrielle kept seeking her out, and even now she could see that the younger girl didn't understand. If she took Gabrielle along, people wouldn't think better of her. They'd think less of Gabrielle. \"You have a good life.\" In the last weeks she'd paid attention to gossip when the talk had turned to the cheery Hufflepuff. Loving parents, a duo of older sisters who kept an indulgent eye on her, and probably an engagement to a boy from a good family in the near future. \"You go on with it. Leave the war to those who cannot walk away.\"\n\nThe girl shook her head. \"But I don't want that life!\" she said with feeling. \"I want to be like you.\"\n\nXena snorted. \"Alone and bitter?\"\n\nGabrielle met her eye solemnly. \"A warrior.\"\n\nXena bristled at that. She, a warrior? A coward, more like. Couldn't even face her own mother. A forgotten daughter, a reviled sister.... \"You don't know what you're talking about,\" she spat, then took a deep breath when she noticed Gabrielle on the brink of tears. There was no use in upsetting the girl, she reminded herself. \"I'm leaving tonight, anyway.\" Before any student had permission to leave the school. \"Goodbye, Gabrielle.\"\n\nWith that, she shot to her feet and strode away.\n\nShe didn't look back to see Gabrielle's expression turn into one of resolution.\n\nPerhaps if she had, she wouldn't have been so shocked when she discovered the girl had followed her after all.\n\n\nThe End\n20\/09\/15","title":"X:WP.

He claims the team\u00a0owes him two months of salary from the 2014-15 season.\u00a0 \n \n\u201cMy wife and I are planning on trying to have children very soon and we had planned our financial future based on the guaranteed nature of my contracts,\u201d Dekanich said via email to Puck Daddy. \u201cThe team is basically stealing from all of our families for work that we have already provided, all the while signing new players, holding training camp, and playing in the 2015\/16 KHL season.\u201d \n \nIn late July, the Colgate graduate took to Twitter to voice his frustration. \n \nAfter patiently waiting 5 months(!) for 1\/3 my salary, I've had enough. Taking action via social media is the last resort. Pay me & I'll go. \n\u2014 Mark Dekanich (@dexshow) July 24, 2015  \nAnd he\u2019s still waiting for his former club to pay him. \n \nDekanich made sure to point out this is not a KHL problem -- this is strictly an issue with his former team. \n \nThe falling Ruble has led to some level of instability with the KHL and questions about the solvency of the league moving forward . Is this symptomatic of those issues? It\u2019s unclear, but it doesn\u2019t sound great for players wanting to suit up for Medvescak. \n \nIn 2013-14 he had a 2.13 goals against average and .936 save percentage for Medvescak. Last season those numbers dropped considerably to a 4.76 GAA and .838 save percentage. \n \nIn his career, Dekanich has held an NHL one-way contract just once \u2013 in 2011-12 with the Columbus Blue Jackets and was slated to be the team\u2019s backup goaltender. He fought injuries that entire season, and didn\u2019t play an NHL game. He has played just 50 NHL minutes, in 2010-11 with the Nashville Predators\u00a0 \n \n[ Yahoo Sports Fantasy Hockey: Sign up and join a league today! ] \n \nWe asked Dekanich to tell us more about why he\u2019s still owed payment. \n \nQ: Do you know other players who have gone through the same thing with Zagreb? \n \nDEKANICH: Yes, I personally know other players who played in Zagreb during their days in the EBEL. They all were owed money that was overdue at a certain time. I'm not sure if they ever received their earned wages in full. \n \nDid you speak to any players before you signed over there about this kind of stuff? There are always rumors that KHL payments aren't exactly on time.\u00a0 \n \nI knew it was a risk inherent to playing overseas, but you never think it will happen to you - until it does. My father was born in Yugoslavia and I was excited to go back to my roots. The money promised and negotiated was a huge upgrade from what I made as an AHL salary the 2012\/13 season in Saint John's. It was upgrading my family's quality of life as well as caliber of hockey. \n \nIs it just your team, or are others have this type of issue? \n \nI can only speak on the club that I was with. There are at least 10 of my teammates from last season who are owed huge chunks of salary from Medvescak\u00a0 \n \nWhat is your goal? To get paid? Bring awareness? \n \nMy goal is to be paid the salary that I earned for last season as negotiated in a binding contract as well as raise awareness of the issues that Medvescak has. My wife and I are planning on trying to have children very soon and we had planned our financial future based on the guaranteed nature of my contracts. The team is basically stealing from all of our families for work that we have already provided, all the while signing new players, holding training camp, and playing in the 2015\/16 KHL season\u00a0 \n \nHow much exactly are you owed by the team? \n \nI am personally still owed over two months of salary. We are supposed to be paid monthly for nine months - September 5, 2014 - May 5, 2015. After our final game on February 22, the scheduled paycheck on March 5 never came. We were given a weak explanation that someone in our sponsor's payroll department was on vacation and that our payment would come in a few weeks. It obviously didn't and we have been strung along ever since with very small portions of what we are owed along and more unmet deadlines. They even tried to get us to sign a payment plan that would pay us out completely by July 2016, a month after their new team would be paid out in full! Few, if any, accepted this proposal and I certainly didn't as none of the previous deadlines the club gave us were met. \n \nHave you gotten any response from them about payment? \n \nOnly false promises through emails of new deadlines and situations. After I finally voiced my situation on my personal Twitter page in July, the club stated publicly that I was not compensated due to performance reasons - which is not only completely false and unwarranted, but also slanderous. Salaries are not performance based, but personal bonuses can be awarded in contracts for performance benchmarks (as below). \n \nAfter my tweets, I received threats via e-mail from the organization that if I spoke about not receiving salary on social media or to any media outlets, I would no longer receive the balance of my salary owed to me - the full amount of which was even acknowledged in a previous email from the club. I wrote the club a letter stating that they should retract their false statement to the media as well as pay me in full by a deadline they had suggested in another previous email. The letter was simply unacknowledged by all of the six people I had addressed it to, including the GM, sports manager, secretary, financial manager, and two PR representatives. \n \nThis was your second year with the team. Did they pay you the year before?\u00a0 In your estimation does any of this have to do with the falling Ruble or the state of the Russian economy? \u00a0 \n \nMy first year in Zagreb was great. The people and city are unbelievable and our fans are undoubtedly some of the best in Europe. They pay was on time with the exception of some bonuses after the season was over. I met a performance bonus, as well as the team bonus for making the playoffs, which we waited on for about 6 weeks past the contractual date. \n \nHindsight is 20\/20 but looking back now, this could have been the first warning sign that the people running the club and their financial budget were inadequate. I don't believe the state of the Ruble or Russian economy is especially pertinent to my situation since our contracts were not negotiated in that currency.\u00a0 \n \n- - - - - - - \n \n Josh Cooper is an editor for Puck Daddy on Yahoo Sports.

{"id":"fabcca18-d0e7-4d11-8d0e-8bc914ac6723","content":"This post has been percolating for two years, it\u2019s a request to folks working on networking, social networks, and other technologies to consider the implications of their actions. My thesis is that the combination of advertising driven firms that sell their audience as the product and efforts to prevent another 9-11 have combined to create a more pervasive surveillance state than we could have imagined a decade go, but without any increase in security. Like Number 6 after his escape from the Village in \u201c The Prisoner \u201d we have all relocated to the panopticon . Be mindful of what you are working on so that you don\u2019t contribute unintentionally. \n Understand the Implications and Impact of Your Work  \nI took a course at Stanford on Decision Analysis from Ron Howard in 1980 when I was getting my Masters in Engineering-Economic Systems and still remember very clearly one of the lectures he gave on the importance of understanding the implications of what you were working on, on knowing the uses your work would be put to. He talked about looking at a pair of brass valves he saw in a Time-Life book. They were beautifully engineered and designed to redirect the exhaust from a large diesel truck into the cargo area. The Nazis, inspired by earlier Russian models , used them to turn trucks into mobile gas chambers . His point was to ask if the German engineer designing the valves had really thought through the implications of his work. \n Who Will Watch The Watchmen  \n\u201cThat everyone is being spied on, or that there is, de facto, a violation of our rights through the mass maintenance of metadata, is in my opinion, not a serious debate. It is a pretend scandal. The real scandal \u2014 that of misuse of the data \u2014 has yet to occur. But it will if we don\u2019t liberalize the secrecy of the FISA court to some meaningful point.\u201d \nDavid Simon \u201c We Are Shocked, Shocked \u201d (2013) \n \nMy argument is not against the need for surveillance\u2013or other weapons for that matter\u2013but for thoughtful management of it to maintain a free society. David Simon wrote a great essay,\u00a0\u201c We Are Shocked, Shocked ,\u201d in 2013 that was a clear eyed view of current police surveillance techniques and the need to be realistic in how to balance privacy with security and avoid corrupt practices on the part of government workers. \u00a0He elaborates more clearly in a back and forth in the comment section: \n \n\u201cIs nuance so elusive? Apparently. \n \nThere is no scandal in the data acquisition. What the Guardian has revealed and claimed as indiscriminate is legit, despite the scope. What should be debated is the lack of oversight of the FISA court and its activity. And that is not the focus of the debate. \n \nI don\u2019t care that the FISA-court has allowed the feds to establish a data base of all American international phone activity. I would expect such given the geopolitical realities of global terror. I worry that in the event of the misuse of that data, we will not learn of the wrongdoing because the civilian oversight of the FISA court is too minimal. The cure for that isn\u2019t to pretend that the relevant data doesn\u2019t exist. The cure is to ensure accountability and greater transparency for the process, while still ensuring that national security secrets offered to the court remain secrets. That is the real issue. \n \nThat everyone is being spied on, or that there is, de facto, a violation of our rights through the mass maintenance of metadata, is in my opinion, not a serious debate. It is a pretend scandal. The real scandal \u2014 that of misuse of the data \u2014 has yet to occur. But it will if we don\u2019t liberalize the secrecy of the FISA court to some meaningful point. \n \nIf that is hard to grasp, I apologize. But not a word of it is contradictory.\u201d \nDavid Simon in a comment on \u00a0June 7, 2013 at 7:37 pm in\u00a0 We Are Shocked, Shocked \n \nThe challenge is how to create a system of checks and balances and mutual accountability as many aspects of our life migrate on-line, either our direct interaction (e.g. making a post on Facebook, running a search on Google) or through the inadvertent action of devices that we carry (a cellphone reporting our location, a NEST thermostat reporting whether someone has adjusted it recently). The Internet of Things means that cyberspace will fully evert into many items that we carry, our online footprints and fingerprints will put us into the equivalent of Jeremy Bentham\u2019s vision of a modern prison, where everyone\u2019s actions can be observed at all times. \n Keeping the NSA in Perspective  \nGeorge Friedman wrote an essay in 2013 that provided an historical perspective on government surveillance, \u201c Keeping the NSA in Perspective ,\u201d that outlined some key differences between what happened after Pearl Harbor (we defeated the Japanese in four years) and the War on Terror (we are continuing to refine and extend a surveillance state apparatus that was only meant to be temporary. \n \nWhat drove all of this was Pearl Harbor. The United States knew that the Japanese were going to attack. They did not know where or when. The result was disaster. All American strategic thinking during the Cold War was built around Pearl Harbor \u2014 the deep fear that the Soviets would launch a first strike that the United States did not know about. The fear of an unforeseen nuclear attack gave the NSA leave to be as aggressive as possible in penetrating not only Soviet codes but also the codes of other nations. You don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know, and given the stakes, the United States became obsessed with knowing everything it possibly could. \n \nIn order to collect data about nuclear attacks, you must also collect vast amounts of data that have nothing to do with nuclear attacks. The Cold War with the Soviet Union had to do with more than just nuclear exchanges, and the information on what the Soviets were doing \u2014 what governments they had penetrated, who was working for them \u2014 was a global issue. But you couldn\u2019t judge what was important and what was unimportant until after you read it. Thus the mechanics of assuaging fears about a \u201cnuclear Pearl Harbor\u201d rapidly devolved into a global collection system, whereby vast amounts of information were collected regardless of their pertinence to the Cold War. \n \nThe Pearl Harbor dread declined with the end of the Cold War \u2014 until Sept. 11, 2001. In order to understand 9\/11\u2019s impact, a clear memory of our own fears must be recalled. As individuals, Americans were stunned by 9\/11 not only because of its size and daring but also because it was unexpected. Terrorist attacks were not uncommon, but this one raised another question: What comes next? \u00a0[..] \n \nThere are two major differences between the war on terror and the aforementioned wars. First, there was a declaration of war in World War II. Second, there is a provision in the Constitution that allows the president to suspend habeas corpus in the event of a rebellion.\u00a0 The declaration of war imbues the president with certain powers as commander in chief \u00a0\u2014 as does rebellion. Neither of these conditions was put in place to justify NSA programs such as PRISM. \n \nMoreover, partly because of the constitutional basis of the actions and partly because of the nature of the conflicts, World War II and the Civil War had a clear end, a point at which civil rights had to be restored or a process had to be created for their restoration. No such terminal point exists for the war on terror. \u00a0[..] \n \nThe threat posed by PRISM and other programs is not what has been done with them but rather what could happen if they are permitted to survive. But this is not simply about the\u00a0 United States \u00a0ending this program. The United States certainly is not the only country with such a program. But a reasonable start is for the country that claims to be most dedicated to its Constitution to adhere to it meticulously above and beyond the narrowest interpretation. This is not a path without danger.

One of the least-noticed implications of our new age of data-intensive politics is that one side has nearly all the marbles. Until the media and other observers develop the tools to independently monitor the uses of Big Data by third-party platforms (as well as campaigns), the integrity of the process will rest entirely on the honesty of the data scientists and engineers inside these organizations, for only they will know if they are playing fairly. And we already know that campaigns will do whatever they think they can get away with to win.

Products has gifted over $200,000 in breast cancer research grants through their partnership with STOP CANCER. The fight to fund a cure continues with #BeerForBoobies at HQ Gastropub and their upcoming Whisky-A-Go-Go \"Cure Rocks\" concert.\n\nLos Angeles, CA (PRWEB) September 09, 2015 \n\nI.C.O.N. Products is no stranger to \"liquid fashion\" in the professional hair industry, hosting the most stylish of soirees, or fundraising in honor of breast cancer research. The second annual \"Cocktails for a Cause\u201d has returned with #BeerForBoobies at HQ Gastropub, located at 20969 Ventura Blvd, Woodland Hills, Calif. 91364 on Sept. 16, 2015. From 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. PST guests will sample first-rate craft and artisan beers, esoteric wines, spirits from small batch distilleries around the world, indulge their taste buds in cutting-edge, pop-culture fared food, bid on silent auction items, and sign up for October's STOP CANCER 5|10K Run|Walk. I.C.O.N. is proud to collaborate with the new San Fernando Valley hotspot, HQ Gastropub, as \u201cHigh Quality\u201d is part of both organizations every move. Mark Matters, HQ\u2019s owner, and creator of its innovative concept stated \"We are an establishment who takes a personal interest in the happiness, well-being of every guest and the community surrounding us. Philanthropy is as important as the food we serve, the beer, wine, and spirits we dispense.\u201d\n\nAs beauty and cause go hand in hand, I.C.O.N\u2019s very own co-founder, creative director, and breast cancer survivor, Chiara is near and dear to the disease. After a most intimate battle with breast cancer, Chiara recognized the immediate need for a professional hair care line to help heal and manage all textures of hair; especially strands altered by the effects of chemotherapy and radiation. Launched in October 2014, I.C.O.N. Products Cure by Chiara micro-line was born with a $95 trio including Cure Replenishing Spray, Recover Shampoo, and Double Body Serum, usable for all cultures and hair types. Designed to change the balance of texture by smoothing and softening wild hair and encouraging body in fine and flat hair, it revives, rejuvenates and repairs hair. \"This line represents my personal story of strength for all those struggling with erratic texture issues. It\u2019s also a celebration for the survivors of this nasty disease, a memorial to those we\u2019ve lost, and hope for future lives to save,\" Chiara said. I.C.O.N\u2019s worldwide \u201cCure for a Cause\u201d campaign donates 20 percent of its Cure by Chiara sales to STOP CANCER direct.\n\nI.C.O.N. partnered with STOP CANCER 501(c)3 in 2007 and has since raised over $200,000 in grant money through their worldwide \u201cCure for a Cause\u201d campaign. The international hair care brand chose to align with STOP CANCER specifically for its unique relationship with UCLA\u2019s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, USC Norris and City of Hope, where every dollar raised is matched with in-kind support to each awardee including space, equipment, telephones, lab supplies, admin services and underlying salary support. The value of every dollar that is contributed is doubled. For 2015, I.C.O.N\u2019s seed grant went to Dr. Erica K. Sloan at UCLA\u2019s JCCC, whose research focuses on the underlying mechanisms through which psychological stress may influence cancer progression. Her research aims to define the neural, inflammatory and tumor mechanisms for the effects of stress on metastasis and to develop pharmacologic strategies to slow cancer progression. An Assistant Adjunct Professor at UCLA's Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, Dr. Sloan is a member of the Cousins Center for Psychoneuroimmunology, UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, and UCLA Aids Institute.\n\nAlongside I.C.O.N\u2019s position as a trendsetter in the professional hair care industry dually stands their \n\ncommitment to funding a cure. Co-founder Chiara related, \"We at I.C.O.N. have made it our company mission to support breast cancer research and fund these grants. 'Cure for a Cause' is our illustration to doing so and requires all of our fighting power to win.\" With October marking Breast Cancer Awareness month, I.C.O.N. is elated to add \"Cure Rocks\" to their public calendar of events. On Oct. 13, 2015, the legendary Whisky-A-Go- Go will open its doors and live stage to include performances by Taylor Hasselhoff, Tomorrow\u2019s Bad Seeds, Lita Ford, All 4 One, plus others TBA. Whether it be through the purchase of Cure by Chiara products one item at a time, wrangling clients and their network of supporters to join their team in STOP CANCER\u2019s yearly 5|10K Run|Walk, or staging an upcoming concert to gift more funds for breast cancer research, I.C.O.N's pursuit to fuel the fight stands strong.\n\nFor more information on I.C.O.N. and their upcoming events, please visit their website and contact their public relations agency, Jade Umbrella.\n\nAbout I.C.O.N.

{"id":"b7eae457-0caa-4265-b5fd-7114f4f26044","content":"Oops, I started this blog post 9 months ago. (I started\u00a0writing on a lunch break and realized I could export my GoodReads data, and then I spent the rest of my break formatting and analyzing data. ~little nerd things~) In the interest of the \u201copen-source\u201d part of open-source mind, this is what the post outline looked like:\u00a0 Near the end of 2014, I decided to read 50 books of people of color in 2015, partly\u00a0inspired by Victoria Law\u2019s post \u201cI Read 50 Books By People of Color This Year.\u201d (\u201cParly inspired\u201d as in, I read the headline on a few people\u2019s news feeds, thought \u201chuh, yeah, I should do that,\u201d and then didn\u2019t click through to the article until months later, when I started writing this blog post. Victoria\u2019s post includes a\u00a0long list of recommendations, yay! And also, Victoria is the\u00a0author of\u00a0Resistance Behind Bars: The Struggles of Incarcerated Women, which is on my to-read list, so yay again!) Here are some numbers from my past reading challenges: Background on reading challenges:\nIn 2013, I decided I wanted to read 50 books, but I didn\u2019t set\u00a0that number until\u00a0December, so I read 7 books that month, including 4 books on Dec. 30 and 31. (I was literally late for a New Year\u2019s Eve party; I left my apartment late with a chunk of book I figured I could\u00a0finish at the bus stop\/on the bus, and ended up reading the last few pages under a streetlight outside of my friend\u2019s building.) Also, speeding through The Time Machine because it was already on my Kindle and I could tell it was short seemed kind of not in the spirit of a reading challenge. In 2014, I raised the goal to 60, and then was funderemployed, so I had time to read a lot. You can also tell from the numbers that about halfway through the year I semi-intentionally started reading more books by BIPOC (Black, indigenous, and people of color). A huge factor in that shift was living in Portland and feeling surrounded by whiteness, and also being more intentional about carving out space and time to be in community with QTPOC and wanting my personal time to reflect that commitment, too. But even thinking about last year\u2019s reading compared to this year\u2019s, when I have a more ambitious goal of reading 50 books by BIPOC writers, I can tell that there\u2019s a huge difference. Not only am I intentionally seeking out authors of color, I\u2019ve also tabled reading books by white authors because I was behind on my reading challenge. It\u2019s also, incidentally, made it more jarring when I\u2019ve made exceptions to read books by white authors. I read Alison Kafer\u2019s\u00a0Feminist, Queer, Crip in May, and wanted to love it, but the race analysis throughout her text often felt\u00a0inauthentic and\/or tacked on and\/or appropriative, in an aspirationally intersectional feminist way.** I am bored of writing this blog post, and I keep not finishing posts (the last thing I published was last November), so the rest of this post will be bullet points. Here\u2019s my \u201cauthors of color\u201d bookshelf on GoodReads. Reading nonfiction by authors of color was incredibly refreshing, and I was surprised how much of a difference it made. It is really, really nice not to be racially microaggressed or erased and invisibilized in the middle of a chunk of otherwise great analysis. It\u2019s also pushed me to read nonfiction that has been languishing on my \u201cTo Read\u2019 shelf for a long time. Some of my faves: Redefining Realness, Janet Mock The Next American Revolution: Sustainable Activism for the Twenty-First Century, Grace Lee Boggs The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing, Marie Kondo (I would have been very stfu if this book was written by a white person) Asian Settler Colonialism: From Local Governance to the Habits of Everyday Life in Hawaii, Ed.\u00a0Candace Fujikane (technically read last December) The New Jim Crow, Michelle Alexander (I will love this book more when Alexander finally decides that she is a prison abolitionist and releases a second edition editing out some of her more reform-minded passages) I\u2019ve read everything Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has published and am sad.*** More sad: Realizing there are a finite number of Octavia Butler works and that I have to pace myself because I can only read her books for the first time once. (In related news, I pre-ordered\u00a0Octavia\u2019s Brood, and have been hoarding it to read on a special occasion.) Things I love about libraries: Did you know you can freeze holds? If you\u2019re going out of town or behind on reading, you can suspend your book holds so they don\u2019t come up when you\u2019re not ready to read them! If you have a library card, you can check out ebooks even when you\u2019re not in the city. (I prefer paper books, but the Kindle is light and my brother bought it for me, and it\u2019s nice to be able to preload a bunch of stuff instead of taking 9 books on a week-long trip.) Theoretically, if you always manually downloaded your ebooks and kept your Kindle on wifi mode, your Kindle would not know to automatically return your library ebooks after the three week checkout period. For a while, I considered doing a \u201crereading the canon\u201d project and revisiting and critiquing books that I\u2019d loved when I was younger, but so far that has just made me sad. (i.e. Being more aware of the colonialism, imperialism, and racism in\u00a0Cat\u2019s Cradle, rereading\u00a0the passage in\u00a0Fahrenheit 451\u00a0where Ray Bradbury calls\u00a0\u201cpolitical correctness\u201d the root of censorship.) Of course, it\u2019s also nice to reread things and be able to recognize my own growth and evolution; and I also think it\u2019s important and valuable to have a concrete understanding of how and where I\u2019ve internalized problematic and or toxic messages, and to reflect on how my perspective has shifted and how I need to intentionally and consciously unlearn internalized oppression. Maybe this line of thought will grow into its own blog post. I\u2019ve also been thinking a lot about how writers who are not in oppressed groups can be better about writing diversity. I appreciate the work of We Need Diverse Books\u00a0(and that they include disabled and queer characters as part of their definitions of diversity instead of solely focusing on race), but I also wish they were more critical and pushed back a little harder on problematic representations of diversity. There\u2019s been a really awful trope (always, really, buy also it seems to be gaining popularity?) of cis writers revealing characters\u2019\u00a0trans identity as a surprise plot twist, and it\u2019s really, really gross and lazy to have that be the explanation of someone\u2019s entire pathos. Or look at the anti-Blackness in Sherman Alexie\u2019s Ten Little Indians.\u00a0Or male writers in general sometimes forgetting that women are people. Roxane Gay spoke at UCLA on Monday (I literally left work in the middle of the afternoon, but I was still late, so my\u00a0live tweets\u00a0are mostly of\u00a0her Q&A), and one of the many fantastic things she said was \u201cDon\u2019t be lazy when writing difference. \u2026 People who get excoriated for writing difference poorly don\u2019t have good intentions.\u201d That seems like a great starting place. I have many, many more thoughts about the politics and burdens of representation and the importance of intersectional feminist analysis and also ~art~ and \u201ccensorship\u201d and etc., etc. For now, I will say that reading writers of color obviously doesn\u2019t eliminate the potential for\u00a0problematic or oppressive writing, but being intentional about curating what I choose to read has\u00a0let me enjoy reading time a lot more. This is blog post length now, right? I will live you with some other faves from the last two years; Parable of the Sower, Octavia Butler \u2014 I\u2019ve heard this described several times as \u201cif The Hunger Games acknowledged that POC exist\u201d and also if the writing and political analysis included an understanding of racism and intersecting systems of oppression, plus it\u2019s based on post-apocalyptic LA and then the road up to Portland On Such a Full Sea, Chang-rae Lee \u2014 future Baltimore, with race and class and science and community engineering Americanah,\u00a0Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie \u2014 hence reading everything she\u2019s written; the intertextuality of the narrator\u2019s blog posts is fucking brilliant, and also the way she talks about race and also there are hilarious moments Notes of a Native Son, James Baldwin \u2014 owned for years, read in preparation for\u00a0Between the World and Me by\u00a0Ta-Nehisi Coates, which I started today, thank you LA Public Library! I did not have to wait as long as I thought I would. Tell Me Again How a Crush Should Feel, Sara Farizan \u2014 technically I gave this book a 3, but it is melodramatic queer YA featuring an awkward fat Persian high school girl, and it was very rewarding to read Ash, Malinda Lo \u2014 a queer YA retelling of Cinderella! And it\u2019s dark! Some passages are\u00a0brilliant, and I loved the feel and pacing The Painted Drum, Louise Erdrich \u2014 intergenerational\u00a0Ojibwe family narrative with multiple kinds of storytelling woven in The Lowland,\u00a0Jhumpa Lahiri \u2014\u00a0Interpreter of Maladies is still my favorite, but have I mentioned that I love multigenerational interwoven family narratives? (see also Zadie Smith\u2019s\u00a0White Teeth) Ten Little Indians, Sherman Alexie \u2014 see note on anti-Blackness above, and also I think some of Alexie\u2019s writing is misogynistic, so this is with a big asterisk, but \u201cFlight Patterns\u201d and \u201cCan I Get a Witness?\u201d are two of the best post-9\/11 short stories I\u2019ve read. Other short story collections:\u00a0Gold Boy, Emerald Girl, Yiyun Li;\u00a0Dismantle: An Anthology of Writing from the Vona\/Voices Writing Workshop; A Good Fall,\u00a0Ha Jin Bad Feminist,\u00a0Roxane Gay \u2014 <3 and now I have a signed copy! chapbooks: Narinda Heng\u2018s\u00a0what is precious\u00a0and Tk Le\u2019s The Labor of Longing\u00a0(it\u2019s not out yet but will be soon, and you will be amazed and cry many tears) * Technically it\u2019s current as of today, because I just started a new book on the bus ride home and have only read 22 pages. (I put a footnote in a caption just because I could.) **\u00a0(I had the same critique for how she addressed\u00a0neurodivergence, though I feel less comfortable making that argument as an able-bodied person.) Also, the appendices include great resources. *** Shout out to Beyonc\u00e9 for making the waiting list for all of her books exponentially longer.","title":"read more books by people of color","media-type":"Blog","source":"open-source mind","published":"2015-09-24T05:31:41Z"}

Especially in western Germany such problems were reported.\u00a0 \n \nIn the north and especially in the south of the country, manufacturers are preoccupied to satisfy demand at a\u00a0generally adequate price level. In the south of Germany, as well as in Austria, the situation is more relaxed due to storm and beetle wood volumes which determine prices\u00a0more favorable from suppliers. In the far north of Germany, manufacturers report slight price increases. Even in Italy, despite the\u00a0generally difficult market situation, prices have increased slightly.\u00a0 \n \nStill with numerous obstacles, German KVH-manufacturers hope to raise prices in the coming weeks. Whether and to what extent this will succeed is debatable considering a slowing construction market and the foreseeable negative end of this year's construction season. \n \nThe current price development in 2015 in Germany and Austria can be described as stable. Also regarding sales volumes there is hardly any movement. The holiday season was as well weak, and prospects for the remaining period of the year are far from being positive.\u00a0 \n \nKVH- and BSH prices \n \nThe price level of 6-8 cm wide KVH is stated at 280-300 EUR\/cu.m if delivered in standard packages. Per dimension level 5 EUR\/cu.m are added. KVH that is delivered by individual lists costs 310-325 EUR\/cu.m. Pricing depends on amount and formation of the list. \n \nPrice for BSH (glulam beams) in non-visible quality is stated at 390-400 EUR\/cu.m in Germany and Austria. Single statements go up to 440 EUR\/cu.m. The general price level for visible qualities is 410-430 EUR\/cu.m and 470 EUR\/cu.m at the top.","title":"Construction timber and glulam prices largely stable in Germany and Austria","media-type":"News","source":"Fordaq","published":"2015-09-24T09:15:07Z"}

Feel free to ask me in the comment section if you aren\u2019t sure and can\u2019t find the info. \n \nPick one of the following recommendations below, depending on if your laptop comes with a single stick of RAM or two, or if you can have up to 4 sticks. \n \nMy recommendations should be compatible with all the laptops recommended in this guide, all those that can be upgraded that is. \n \nI recommend the most reliable sticks that I can find and that are available internationally. \n Add a single 8GB stick: Crucial 8GB 1600MHz DDR3 SODIMM  \n\u2013 $39.99 (Amazon) \n\u2013 $39.00 (B&H \u2013 International Shipping) \n 2x4GB (8GB) kit: Crucial 8GB (2x4GB) 1600MHz DDR3 SODIMM  \n\u2013 $46.99 (Amazon) \n\u2013 $44.52 (B&H \u2013 International Shipping) \n 2x8GB (16GB) kit: Crucial 16GB (2x8GB) 1600MHz DDR3 SODIMM  \n\u2013 $72.99\u00a0(Amazon) \n\u2013 $78.00 (B&H \u2013 International Shipping) \n \nClick here to go back up to the summary \n Upgrade your hard drive:  \nYou can upgrade your hard drive to a faster and\/or a larger hard drive. See our article on The Best Hard Drives (HDD) For Your Money and scroll down to the best 2.5\u2033 hard drives for my recommendations. \n \nDo note that most laptops accept hard drives with a 9.5mm height. Some laptops, can only accept drives with a 7mm height, but those are the exception rather than the norm. Do also note that some laptops cannot be upgraded at all, due to their unique design. \n Upgrade to a SSD  \nSSD wise, I recommend 7mm thick SSDs, so they should fit in pretty much any laptop with a standard hard drive. \n \nA SSD (Solid State Drive) is far faster than a hard drive (See our SSD FAQ ) and it also consumes less power than a hard drive, so replacing a hard drive by a SSD will slightly boost your laptop\u2019s battery life. \n \nIf you want to upgrade your hard drive to a SSD, I recommend that you read our \u2018 The Best SSDs (Solid State Drives) For Your Money \u2018 article. \n \nI also recommend getting this Kingwin SATA to USB 3.0 adapter: $15.99 at B&H (International Shipping) , to help you transfer the content of your hard drive to the SSD, in order to minimize downtime and make your life easier. It\u2019s compatible with pretty much all 2.5\u2033 SATA drives. \n Keep your old hard drive for external storage via an USB 3.0 enclosure:  \nWhen you replace the hard drive that your laptop came with, I recommend putting it in the Sabrent USB 3.0 2.5\u2033 SATA Hard Drive Enclosure: \n\u2013 $14.99 (Amazon) \n\u2013 $13.40 (B&H \u2013 International Shipping) \n \nThat way you can use your hard drive for external portable storage, such as backups. \n \nThis particular enclosure comes with a retractable cable that is connected to the enclosure, so you don\u2019t lose\/forget it and it makes the whole package more compact too. It comes with an extension cord if you need it. \n \nClick here to go back up to the summary \n USB DVD and Blu-Ray Drives  \nIf your laptop doesn\u2019t come with an optical drive and you want one, here are my recommendations for external USB optical drives. \n USB DVD Burner  \nThere are many models of USB DVD Burners. The LG GP60NB50 8x is the one with the best customer reviews: \n\u2013 $25.96 (Amazon) \n\u2013 $24.49 (B&H \u2013 International Shipping) \n USB Blu-Ray Burner  \nI recommend two USB Blu-Ray burner. Make sure to plug them in an USB 3.0 port to get the maximum speed possible. \n \nIn order of price and burning speed: \n\u2013 Pioneer BDR-XD055 6x \u2013 $84.99 (B&H \u2013 International Shipping) \n \nLG BE14NU40 14x: \n\u2013 $129.95 (Amazon) \n\u2013 $114.99 (B&H \u2013 International Shipping) \n \nClick here to go back up to the summary \n WiFi routers, WiFi Adapters and Bluetooth adapter:  \nNeed a WiFi router, a faster WiFi adapter or a Bluetooth adapter for your laptop?

(Photo: Sumisha Naidu)   \n\"We respect other ethnicities but don't forget Malays have our feelings too. Malays too have rights,\" he told the crowd. \n\n\"Malays too can show that we can still rise up, rise up when our dignity is challenged; rise up when our leaders are insulted, ridiculed, embarrassed. Malays say enough, let no one repeat evil acts like that again\" \n\nVideo of the silat assembly. (1) \n\nThe \"red shirt\" rally was meant to counter last month's Bersih protest where tens of thousands had called for Mr Najib's resignation amid a corruption scandal. \n\nBut the Malaysian National Silat Federation and other Malay groups felt Bersih was dominated by ethnic Chinese supporters of opposition party DAP who had disrespected Malay leaders. \n\nSo they had their own protest on Sep 16, the anniversary of the formation of the Malaysian federation more than 50 years ago. \n\nDespite incidents of police struggling to contain the crowd and some reports of racial slurs being hurled at non-Malays present, Mr Najib said the protest was peaceful and non-seditious as Malays were \"civilised\". \n\nStill, there were fears that the rally could widen the divide between the ethnic majority and other ethnicities in Malaysia. \n\nFORMER UMNO LEADER ARRESTED \n\nThe same night as the silat assembly, a former UMNO leader was arrested by police for \"attempting to topple the government\". \n\nKhairuddin Abu Hassanf was detained hours after he was barred from travelling to New York where he had planned to urge US law enforcement officials to investigate a state investment fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). \n\nMr Najib advises the debt-ridden firm and has been accused of channelling funds through 1MDB-linked entities to his personal bank accounts. \n\nThe Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission has since said that close to US$700 million deposited into the PM\"s bank accounts were donations from the Middle East that had no connection to 1MDB. \n\nHowever, some Malaysians still say there are question marks surrounding the mass donation, which was one of the reasons behind the Bersih protest. \n\nBut at the silat assembly, Mr Najib also stressed that a democratically-elected government cannot be removed by a street protest. \n\n- CNA\/av","title":"Ethnic Malays of Malaysia should not be disrespected: PM Najib","media-type":"Blog","source":"Channel NewsAsia","published":"2015-09-19T04:12:43Z"}

FIREFIGHTERS HAVE MADE PROGRESS ON CONTAINMENT -- NOW UP TO 50% AND HOLDING STEADY AT 1100 ACRES. WE HAVE LEARNED THREE MORE HOMES HAVE BEEN LOST, BRINGING THE TOTAL TO THIRTEEN. SEVEN OUT BUILDINGS HAVE ALSO BEEN DESTROYED. THE MONTEREY COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SAYS AN AUTOPSY ON THE BODY FOUND IN A BURNED OUT CAR ON SATURDAY IS UNDERWAY. THEY SAY FOR NOW THEY ARE TREATING THAT AREA AS A CRIME SCENE. EVACUATION ORDERS HAVE BEEN LIFTED FOR RESIDENTS OUTSIDE THE FIRE PERIMETER, BUT MANY ROAD CLOSURES REMAIN IN EFFECT THIS MORNING. PG&E IS MAKING SURE THAT EVACUEES WHO ARE ALLOWED TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES HAVE POWER WHEN THEY GET THERE. PG&E CREWS SPENT MOST OF YESTERDAY ASSESSING THE DAMAGE IN THE AREA. POWER LINES ARE DOWN AND NEARLY 250 CUSTOMERS ARE WITHOUT POWER. BLAIR JONES: WE'RE WORKING HAND IN HAND WITH CALFIRE TO ASSESS THE AREA WHERE THE FIRE HAS ALREADY IMPACTED. WE'RE GOING TO ASSESS HOW MUCH DAMAGE THERE IS TO OUR EQUIPMENT AND HOPEFULLY BY TOMORROW WE'LL BE IN A POSITION WHERE WE CAN START MAKING REPAIRS AND WE CAN SAFELY RESTORE POWER AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN FOR OUR CUSTOMERS.

THEY NEED TO PAY ATTENTION IF THERE'S FLASHING LIGHTS -- HAS A -- PAY ATTENTION TO ROAD CONDITIONS AND TO THE TRAFFIC THAT IS OUT THERE. AND EVERYTHING WILL WORK OUT JUST FINE. FELIX: ON ONE STRETCH OF 68, THE SPEED LIMIT HAS BEEN REDUCED TO 35 MILES PER HOUR. AND THE CHP IS ENFORCING IT. CALFIRE SAYS IT'S TRYING TO ACCOMMODATE COMMUTERS BY GETTING THEIR TRUCKS AND FIREFIGHTERS ON THE ROAD EARLY BEFORE MOST COMMUTERS HIT THE ROAD. TAKING CARE OF THAT RUBBER NECKING ISSUE -- MORE OF AN OUT OF SITE OUT OF MIND. FELIX: THE TORO PARK BASE CAMP MAY GROW IN SIZE AS MORE FIREFIGHTERS AND EQUIPMENT RESPOND TO THE TASSAJARA FIRE.

At the meeting, Modi was asked for clarity in taxation policy, a faster tendering process and less stringent rules for local manufacturing. \n\nThe heads of Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Textron and others called for a relaxation of the offset policy and simplification of the bidding process. Offsets are aimed at ensuring technology transfer as part of purchase contracts. The ministries will be monitored on goals that were set for them in December 2014 following the Make in India launch. Various government departments such as steel, power, petroleum and shipping have been asked to identify components being imported in their sectors and devise a plan to manufacture these in India. The government had asked the ministries to fix procedures, incentives and finalise cabinet notes wherever required to translate these plans into action. \"For each of these tasks, a deadline was set. Now is the time to start monitoring how far along we have come,\" said the official cited above. \n\nGoing forward, based on the recommendations of the World Bank, ministries will be given additional things to do. \n\nThe Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) for instance has asked the Central Board of Direct Taxes to scrap the requirement for a company seal for PAN registration. \n\nThe Employee State Insurance Corporation has been told to provide proper identity cards to workers instead of temporary ones to reduce processes. DIPP has also written to the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation to reduce paperwork based on the World Bank's suggestions. \n\nThe government wants all ministries to implement these measures by June 2016 to raise India's ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business index. This is currently at 142 out of 189, something the Modi government has said it wants to improve. As part of this exercise, the government recently ranked states on ease of doing business. \n\nIndia currently doesn't feature among the top 100 countries on eight of the index's 10 parameters.","title":"PMO to take stock of Make in India action points","media-type":"News","source":"Economic Times","published":"2015-09-29T22:19:03Z"}

As a result, our nurses are learning to think like the doctors they work with, and they get comfort and assurance from the physicians that they are doing the right thing.\" The telehospitalist physicians are also available to talk by phone and to text with nursing staff when their advice is needed.\n\nA quicker solution to the physician shortage\n\nJason Kimball \n\n\"It's all about the patients and keeping them close to their homes for exceptional medical care,\" he said. \"It's great for the nurses, too.

Telemedicine helps them play a bigger role in their hospitals and become real cornerstones in the care that is provided.\"\n\nFor patients, the response has also been positive. \"They appreciate immediate access to a physician,\" Watson said. \"What we're offering is a quicker solution to the physician shortage than anything else that is available. Patients can see it. And it's a revelation for our employees.\"\n\nPioneers in inpatient telemedicine\n\nAs a pioneer in inpatient telemedicine, Eagle has spent more than five years perfecting its telemedicine service models of care and tailoring them to specific settings, such as rural hospitals where telemedicine can bring specialized care to the bedside where it might otherwise be unavailable.\n\nBenefits to rural hospitals include:\n\n\"Telemedicine is most effective when applied where physician resources are scarce and patient care is time sensitive,\" said Dr. McCormick. \"And it is providing hope to rural hospitals in an era when closure is a very real possibility unless new models of care are deployed. We look forward to sharing information about our new services and successes with attendees at the NRHA conference.\"\n\nAbout Eagle Telemedicine\n\nFounded in 2008, Eagle Telemedicine was one of the first companies to emerge in the telemedicine physician service arena and continues to serve as a pioneer in the industry today, leading practical solutions, management tools and innovation through the use of telemedicine.
