0,"""Worcester's veterans have been given a helping hand in the form of a new breakfast club.  The club, which is run by local charity The Worcester Community Trust, provides a free hot breakfast to veterans every Sunday morning.  The initiative was launched in response to the growing number of veterans in the area who are struggling to make ends meet.  ""We wanted to do something to help those who have served our country and are now in need of support,"" said Sarah Jones, the charity's CEO.  The breakfast club is open to all veterans, regardless of age, gender, or rank. It provides a hot meal and a friendly atmosphere for those who may be feeling isolated or lonely.  ""It's great to see so many veterans coming together and enjoying a meal together,"" said Jones. ""It's a great way to build a sense of community and camaraderie.""  The club has been warmly welcomed by the local community, with many people donating food, money, and time to help make it a success.  ""It's really heartening to see how generous people have been,"" said Jones. ""This club wouldn't be possible without their help.""  The Worcester Community Trust is hoping to expand the breakfast club to other areas of the city in the future.  ""We want to make sure that no veteran in Worcester is left feeling isolated or forgotten,"" said Jones.  The Worcester Community Trust's breakfast club is a vital lifeline for veterans in the area, providing them with a hot meal and a sense of community. It is a shining example of how the local community can come together to make a difference in the lives of those who have served our country.""","VETERANS saluted Worcester's first ever breakfast club for ex-soldiers which won over hearts, minds and bellies.    The Worcester Breakfast Club for HM Forces Veterans met at the Postal Order in Foregate Street at 10am on Saturday.    The club is designed to allow veterans a place to meet, socialise, eat and drink, giving hunger and loneliness their marching orders.    Father-of-two Dave Carney, aged 43, of Merrimans Hill, Worcester, set up the club after being inspired by other similar clubs across the country.    He said: ""As you can see from the picture, we had a good response. Five out of the 10 that attended said they saw the article in the newspaper and turned up.    ""We even had an old chap travel from Droitwich and he was late on parade by three hours.    ""It's generated a lot of interest and I estimate (from other veterans who saw the article) that next month's meeting will attract about 20 people. Onwards and upwards.""    He said the management at the pub had been extremely hospitable to them.    Mr Carney said: ""They bent over backwards for us. They really looked after us well. That is the best choice of venue I could have made. They even put 'reserved for the armed forces'.     Promoted stories    The reserve veteran with the Royal Engineers wanted to go to a breakfast club but found the nearest ones were in Bromsgrove and Gloucester so he decided to set up his own, closer to home.    He was influenced by Derek Hardman who set up a breakfast club for veterans in Hull and Andy Wilson who set one up in Newcastle. He said the idea has snowballed and there were now 70 similar clubs across the country and even some in Germany.    Mr Carney said with many Royal British Legion clubs closing he wanted veterans and serving personnel to feel they had somewhere they could go for good grub, beer and banter to recapture the comradery of being in the forces.    The Postal Order was chosen because of its central location and its proximity to the railway station and hotels and reasonably priced food and drink.    The management of the pub have even given the veterans a designated area within the pub.       Share article       The next meeting is at the Postal Order on Saturday, October 3 at 10am.    The breakfast club meets on the first Saturday of each month for those who want to attend in future."

2,"THE INFLUENCE OF OUR WORDS  The power of words is often underestimated, but it is undeniable that they have a profound influence on our lives. Whether spoken, written or heard, words can be used to create or destroy, to heal or hurt, to encourage or discourage.  In the Times of Swaziland, we are reminded time and time again of the power of words. From the inspiring speeches of our leaders to the thought-provoking articles that have been published in this newspaper, words have the potential to shape our society and the future of our nation.  Words can be used to express our thoughts and feelings, to share knowledge and ideas, and to create a connection between people. They can be used to uplift and motivate, to bring people together, and to create a sense of unity and purpose.  Words can also be used to spread lies and misinformation, to spread hate and fear, and to manipulate and control. They can be used to divide and conquer, to create conflict and chaos, and to sow the seeds of mistrust and misunderstanding.  The power of words is immense, and it is important that we use them responsibly. We must be mindful of the impact our words have on others, and strive to use them in ways that are beneficial to all.  We must be careful not to spread false information or make unfounded claims. We must be respectful and understanding of different opinions and beliefs, and strive to create a dialogue that is constructive and respectful. We must be careful to avoid inflammatory language and instead use words that are calming and healing.  We must also be mindful of the words we use when speaking to ourselves. We must be gentle and kind, and strive to use words that are uplifting and motivating. We must be conscious of our self-talk, and strive to use words that are empowering and inspiring.  The power of words is undeniable, and we must use them responsibly. We must be mindful of the impact our words have on others, and strive to use them in ways that are beneficial to all. We must use words that are truthful and respectful, and strive to create a dialogue that is constructive and healing. By doing so, we can ensure that our words have a positive influence on our society and our nation.","Words kill or give life; they are usually either poison or good fruit. The words we speak are electromagnetic forces that usually reflect our inner attitude.     They contain the power of death and life and ultimately influence the world around us. Augustus Woodbury once said, “Scientific men tell us that every sound upon the surface of our own and other planets circulates in endless and ceaseless waves through infinite space. Certainly not less subtle is the influence of our words upon the life and character of the world.” We must always think about the influence of our words before we say them out; “what is my objective in saying this.” “Are these words going to produce life or death.” Proverbs 18:21 declares, “Death and life are in the power of the tongue and those who love it will eat its fruit.”     As a matter of fact, words are our input in someone else’s life. We must make sure our input gives life and not death. We are actually responsible for the impact we have on others and our communities in general.    As responsible citizens, we must intensify our awareness of the input we have on other people’s lives. Actually, one person can change the course of another person’s life with the power of words. Individual dreams and visions have been aborted because of words of death spoken over them. Homes and marriages have been destroyed because of poisonous words. Companies and businesses have fallen because of words of envy and jealousy. People have lost their jobs because of lying words said about them. We should always be conscious of the life-changing power of our words.     Proverbs 19:1 says, “Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity than one who is crooked in speech and is a fool.” We must use wisdom when we speak, by checking our motives, attitudes and choice of words. We must divorce negative patterns of thinking and bring life to others with our words. Words are influencers. One of the best ways we can use words to influence others, is to practice telling the truth.    We are living in the world where too often people try to influence others with manipulation, false flattery and deception and spin doctoring. The truth creates trust, which in turn generates influence. The other way we can put our words to good use, is to choose to use words that build in our speech, rather than words that tear down people and society.     We should use our words to build other people up, to inspire, encourage and empower, to affirm and bless. Positive words yield positive influence. It is wisdom to refuse to speak words that belittle and demoralise other people around us. When we make a choice of speaking well of others, in-spite of their short comings, then we will have a healthy and far reaching positive influence with our words.    If we spread malicious gossip, we are poisoning our own future and sabotaging our own influence with others. King Solomon of ancient Israel said, “When a leader listens to malicious gossip, all the workers get infested with evil” (Proverbs 29:12, the message Bible). We must use the influence of our words to bring peace in conflicting situations.     Due to the fact that many people have no understanding of the power of their words, they have caused themselves and others unnecessary pain and hardships. Each and every day our actions and our words impact those around us.    The question is, how are we influencing others with our words and actions? One of the best ways we can influence each other is by inspiring, motivating and encouraging each other by what we say. The story is told about how Sugar Ray Robinson changed the course of one girl’s life, Flo-Jo.    When narrating her life story Flo-Jo said, “Sugar Ray looked at me in the eye and told me, it doesn’t matter where you come from, what the colour of your skin is, or what odds are against you. All that matters is that you have a dream and you commit yourself to that dream. Do that and it will happen.” She continued and said, “Right then and there, I was sold out. I was just eight years old but I was fired up about what my future could be.”     With words, Sugar Ray Robinson, one of the outstanding boxing champs inspired a great change in one girls’ life. Words are powerful, they can inspire those around us to greatness. They can bring hope to the hopeless, courage to the discouraged, comfort and healing to the oppressed. We must speak life to our husbands, wives, children, fathers, mothers, our communities and nation.    Paul’s wise advice to the Ephesians is appropriate at this juncture, “Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers.” (Ephesians 4:29). By our words we can build the nation and by our words we can destroy the nation."
3,"Hands on with Apple's iPhone 6s, iPad Pro and Apple TV  Apple has been on a roll lately, with the release of their new iPhone 6s, iPad Pro and Apple TV. We got the chance to get our hands on all three of these devices, and what we found was impressive.  The iPhone 6s is the latest iteration of Apple's flagship smartphone. It comes with a 4.7-inch Retina HD display, an A9 processor, and a 12MP iSight camera. The device is also equipped with Touch ID for secure authentication and Apple Pay for mobile payments. In our hands-on experience, the phone felt fast and responsive, with no noticeable lag or stutter. The display was bright and vibrant, and the camera was able to capture sharp, detailed images.  The iPad Pro is Apple's latest tablet, and it's a powerhouse. It features a 12.9-inch Retina display, an A9X processor, and a 8MP iSight camera. It also has the same Touch ID and Apple Pay features as the iPhone 6s. We found the iPad Pro to be a great device for productivity, with its large display and powerful processor. The display was bright and crisp, and the camera was able to capture sharp images with accurate colors.  Finally, there's the Apple TV. This device is a streaming media player, and it has a lot of potential. It comes with a Siri-enabled remote, and it supports a wide range of apps and services. We found the device to be very responsive, and the picture quality was excellent. The remote was also very intuitive and easy to use.  Overall, we were impressed with all three of these devices. The iPhone 6s is a great phone, the iPad Pro is a great tablet, and the Apple TV is a great streaming media player. All three devices offer something unique, and they are all worth considering for anyone looking for a new device.","Just in time for the holiday shopping seasons, Apple has announced a series of hardware upgrades for the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. iPhone's price sees steep increaseAll the Apple announcements Just in time for the holiday shopping season, Apple has announced a series of hardware upgrades for the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. With the iPhone, the company added a feature called 3D Touch, which lets users control some of the software by exerting pressure on the touch screen. The Apple TV got its first big upgrade in more than three years with a more powerful chip and a redesigned remote control. Apple's family of iPads also gained a bigger sibling with the iPad Pro, a tablet with a 12.9-inch screen — much larger than the older 9.7-inch iPad.  At the event, I tried out the new products in a demonstration booth. Here are some first impressions: iPhone  The 3D Touch capability is the iPhone's signature new feature. Pressing down on the screen starts different actions, depending on how much force is exerted.  A light press on an email, for example, shows a preview of the message, and a hard press then opens the email. You can also press down hard on an app icon to open shortcuts to different actions — for example, pushing down on the Instagram app shows a list of next steps, including the ability to create a new post. When you press down hard, the device responds with a tapping sensation.  I found the new iPhones pretty straightforward to use. The 3D Touch feature is easy to get used to, and I quickly figured out how to create a new calendar appointment by pressing down hard on the calendar app icon.  The new smartphones are also slightly thicker and heavier than their predecessors, though I confess I noticed that only after reading the specifications on Apple's website and not when holding the devices. iPad  The iPad Pro's jumbo screen obviously gives more room for content to breathe, but interacting with it still feels the same as with older iPad tablets.  The iPad Pro is capable of running two full-size iPad apps on the screen at the same time. The previous iPad Air 2 could run two apps at the same time, but with a primary app taking up a larger portion of the screen.  The large device will be familiar to most because apart from its size, it works the same as previous versions of the tablet. The big-screen iPad also felt comfortable to hold. It weighs about 680 grams, which is the same weight as the very first iPad. Apple TV  The Apple TV is significantly different from past models. The software interface has a white background and vivid colours, similar to Apple's Music app. The new remote control includes a touch pad for scrolling around the menu and a microphone for finding things to watch using Siri, Apple's voice assistant. The remote also includes motion sensors for gaming.  I decided to have some fun by asking Siri to help me navigate content on Apple TV. For example, I tried using Siri to steer a spaceship in a Star Wars game. But that was difficult, perhaps because of my inexperience with the game.  I also tried searching for action movies and comedy movies with the remote control's microphone. Siri misunderstood me when I said ""comedy,"" thinking I had said ""comity."" But it did a better job with action movies — when I said ""show me action movies,"" Siri brought up a list of titles including Mad Max and Furious 7.  The new remote control is thicker than the previous one, and in this case, that's a good thing. The previous Apple TV remote was so thin that it had a tendency to disappear between couch cushions.

5,"Peta Credlin and Brian Loughnane, the power couple at the heart of the Liberal Party, have been the driving force behind the party’s success for the past decade. But now, with the Liberal Party’s fortunes in decline and a new leader at the helm, the question on everyone’s lips is: what will happen to the Liberal power couple?  The answer is not yet clear. Credlin, who was chief of staff to former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, and Loughnane, who was the party’s federal director, have been largely absent from the public eye since the Liberal Party’s election loss in 2016.  While Credlin and Loughnane have yet to make any official announcements about their future plans, speculation is rife that the couple may be looking to move on from the Liberal Party.  Credlin has been vocal in her criticism of the party’s current leadership, saying that the party has become too focused on the “politics of personality” and has lost sight of its core values.  Loughnane, meanwhile, has been less outspoken but is reportedly considering his options.  The couple’s departure from the Liberal Party would be a major blow to the party, which has struggled to find its feet since the 2016 election.  The party’s current leader, Scott Morrison, has been attempting to move the party in a new direction, but without the support of Credlin and Loughnane, it is unclear whether he will be able to succeed.  It is also unclear what Credlin and Loughnane’s next move may be. Some have speculated that the couple may return to the private sector, while others have suggested that they may look to establish their own political consultancy.  Whatever the outcome, it is clear that the future of the Liberal Party will be significantly different without the contributions of Peta Credlin and Brian Loughnane.  The couple have been instrumental in the success of the Liberal Party over the past decade, and their departure is likely to have a major impact on the party’s future.  Only time will tell what the future holds for the Liberal power couple, but one thing is for sure: Peta Credlin and Brian Loughnane have left an indelible mark on the Liberal Party and Australian politics.","Tony Abbott's last word   Watch the last press conference of outgoing Prime Minister Tony Abbott in full.   PT6M11S   620  349      They're the power couple who have run the Liberal Party back-room operation since December 2009.   But Tony Abbott's ousting as prime minister will inevitably lead to his high-profile chief of staff, Peta Credlin, quitting the blue carpet in Parliament House's ministerial wing.    Peta Credlin and Brian Loughnane arrive for the Midwinter Ball at Parliament House in June. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen      What will happen to her husband, long-serving Liberal Party federal director Brian Loughnane, is less clear.    Ms Credlin worked for Malcolm Turnbull during his stint as opposition leader in 2008-09, but the pair did not always see eye to eye and she will not be working for the incoming leader.   After her time with Mr Turnbull, Ms Credlin became the dominant figure in the Abbott government, described as a controlling co-prime minister by her critics, lauded by her allies — not least Mr Abbott, who called her the ""fiercest political warrior I've ever worked with"".  As chief of staff, she became one of the most high-profile staffers in recent political history.    From the first days of the Abbott opposition in December 2009, Peta Credlin was in the room as one of his most trusted lieutenants. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen      From the first days of the Abbott opposition in December 2009, Ms Credlin was in the room as one of the opposition leader's most trusted lieutenants alongside press secretaries and advisers Andrew Hirst and Claire Kimball, honing and refining Mr Abbott's laser-like attack on Kevin Rudd's carbon pollution reduction scheme.   After just less than four years in opposition,  in September 2013, Ms Credlin, a lawyer with years of experience in the Howard government, made the transition as chief of staff into government.   But the tightly controlled approach adopted in opposition did not work as smoothly in government.    Mr Abbott and Ms Credlin in 2013. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen      Public complaints about a "" command and control "" approach taken by the prime minister's office quickly surfaced, and a reliance on slogans that worked in opposition did not cut through in government.   In February 2015, when Mr Abbott faced a spill motion in the party room, some MPs were calling for a shake-up of the prime minister's office, and for political veteran Tony Nutt to be brought into the office.   Ms Credlin disappeared from public view, for a time, but the complaints soon resurfaced.    Brian Loughnane has been federal director of the Liberal Party since 2003. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen      But Mr Abbott refused suggestions of change to his office: in his farewell speech, he singled out his chief of staff  ""who has been unfairly maligned by people who should've known better"".   And now, both exit the political centre stage, at least for a time.   Mr Loughnane, meanwhile, has been federal director of the Liberal Party since February 2003 and party strategists told Fairfax Media on Tuesday that, if possible, he should continue in the role.   One veteran pointed out that Mr Turnbull and Mr Loughnane had worked together before, during Mr Turnbull's stint as opposition leader, and that a change in director was not ""necessary or inevitable"".   That veteran also said the prime minister's office would likely benefit from a bit of ""competitive tension"" between it and Liberal Party HQ.   ""It depends on the relationship between the two of them; [Mr Loughnane] has served every leader since Howard.      But Malcolm will have to be comfortable with the director – you can't have a situation like [former prime minister] Paul Keating and [former ALP secretary] Gary Gray [in 1996].""   A second Liberal veteran said Ms Credlin was ""very talented and a good manager, but it will be hard for her to stay in the show. I do hope Brian stays on. The most important thing is corporate knowledge and experience.""   Fairfax Media sought comment from Ms Credlin and Mr Loughnane.   On Tuesday, Mr Turnbull also began the process of putting together his office team.   The former secretary of the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism, and of the Communications Department, Drew Clarke, will serve as his acting chief of staff, while Mr Nutt, who worked closely with Turnbull backer Senator Arthur Sinodinos in the office of John Howard, will return to Canberra to help manage the transition to the prime ministership.   Senator Sinodinos confirmed on Tuesday that Mr Turnbull would seek to emulate the attitude of Mr Howard as prime minister by taking a team approach, ""and have a number of senior people in there who can provide advice and make sure it's an open prime minister's office, it's accessible and that there are tributaries of advice going to the prime minister,"" he told Sky News.   ""The role of the office is not to be a gatekeeper and cut people off; the role of the office has to be a facilitator of contact so the prime minister knows and has early warning of whether there are concerns.   ""You don't need the polls if you have backbenchers who are frank and willing to tell you what is going on.""   Follow James Massola on Facebook .   Follow us on Twitter"

7,"New Hillary Clinton Email Chain Discovered  In a shocking turn of events, a new email chain featuring Hillary Clinton has been discovered. The emails, which were part of a larger trove of emails obtained by the FBI, were released to the public on Tuesday.  The emails, which were sent between October and November of 2016, appear to show Clinton discussing the possibility of a presidential run in 2020. The emails also appear to indicate that Clinton was in contact with a number of high-profile political figures, including former President Barack Obama.  The emails were discovered in the course of the FBI's investigation into the hack of the Democratic National Committee's emails. The FBI has not yet released the full contents of the emails, but they have confirmed that they are real.  The revelations have already prompted a response from the Clinton camp, who have denied any involvement in the hack. In a statement, a Clinton spokesperson said: ""We have no knowledge of any emails being hacked or any involvement by Hillary Clinton.""  The emails have also sparked speculation about whether Clinton will indeed run for president in 2020. While she has not officially announced her candidacy, the emails appear to suggest that she is at least considering the possibility.  The emails have also raised questions about the FBI's investigation into the hack. It is unclear why the emails were not discovered earlier, and why the FBI has only now released them.  The emails have also reignited the debate over Clinton's use of a private email server while she was Secretary of State. Critics of the former Secretary of State have long argued that her use of a private server put sensitive government information at risk.  The discovery of the emails has also sparked a renewed interest in the 2016 presidential election. While Clinton was ultimately defeated by Donald Trump, the emails suggest that she was still actively considering a run for the White House.  The discovery of the emails has already prompted a flurry of speculation and debate. It remains to be seen what impact, if any, the emails will have on the 2020 presidential race.","Official says 'small number' of Benghazi-related emails   By   Updated 09/25 2015 06:51PM   Copyright 2015 Cable News Network/Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.   An email chain between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and then-commander of U.S. Central Command David Petraeus from January and February 2009 is raising questions about whether some of the emails on Clinton's private email server were mistakenly deemed personal and not included among the 55,000 pages of emails she turned over to the State Department.   Separately on Friday, a State Department official said a ""small number"" of Benghazi-related emails that had not been disclosed to the House committee investigating the 2012 terror attack had been discovered.   In the past few days, the State Department was contacted by the Department of Defense about the Clinton-Petraeus chain, two State Department officials said. The officials say the chain does not appear to include classified information, though an official determination has not been made. The chain included Clinton and Petraeus getting acquainted as well as some personnel matters, according to the officials. It was apparently considered personal by Clinton's team and therefore wasn't turned over to the State Department, the officials said.   Most of the email chain was on an old email server Clinton says she no longer has access to, but the end of the email chain contained messages on the private server she used while in office, according to another official. The chain begins on January 10, 2009 and ends on Feb. 1, 2009 and contains less than 10 emails total between Clinton and Petraeus, the official said.   State Department spokesman John Kirby said State received ""several copies of one email chain between former Secretary Clinton and then Commander of U.S. Central Command David Petraeus which were not previously in the possession of the Department"" from the Department of Defense and the State Inspector General. ""These emails are now in our possession and will be subject to Freedom of Information Act requests. Furthermore, we asked the IG to incorporate this matter into the review Secretary Kerry requested in March. We have also informed Congress of this matter.""   Also on Friday, a State Department official also told CNN that in the process of turning over Libya-related emails to the Select Committee on Benghazi, it found a ""small number"" of Benghazi-related emails that had not been disclosed to the committee previously. These emails are among 925 Libya-related emails being turned over Friday and were found within the emails Clinton turned over to the State Department from her private server. The official said the emails were found because they have now been digitized and are easier to search.   Clinton turned over to State her work-related emails from the server and kept emails she deemed personal. The email server has since been turned over to the FBI, where investigators have been able to recover both the personal and work-related emails. The FBI is looking into whether any classified materials were mishandled."
8,"Five Key Plays From Texas State's Home Opener  The Texas State Bobcats kicked off their 2020 season with a thrilling victory at home against the Louisiana Monroe Warhawks. While the Bobcats came out on top, the game was full of exciting plays that helped decide the outcome. Here are five of the key plays from the game that helped the Bobcats secure the victory:  1. The first key play of the game came late in the first half when Texas State quarterback Tyler Vitt found wide receiver Caleb Twyford for a 39-yard touchdown pass. This score put the Bobcats up 14-7 and gave them a much-needed boost of momentum heading into the second half.  2. The second key play of the game came early in the third quarter when the Bobcats' defense forced a fumble on a Louisiana Monroe drive. The Bobcats recovered the ball and were able to capitalize on the turnover with a touchdown drive of their own.  3. The third key play of the game came late in the third quarter when Texas State safety Jaden Wright intercepted a pass deep in Louisiana Monroe territory. This interception set up a Bobcats touchdown drive that put them up 21-14.  4. The fourth key play of the game came early in the fourth quarter when Texas State running back Anthony D. Smith broke off a 34-yard run that set up a Bobcats touchdown. This score put the Bobcats up 28-14 and gave them a commanding lead.  5. The fifth and final key play of the game came late in the fourth quarter when Texas State defensive end Deandre Coleman forced a fumble on a Louisiana Monroe drive. The Bobcats recovered the ball and were able to run out the clock to secure the victory.  These five key plays from the Texas State Bobcats' home opener against the Louisiana Monroe Warhawks were instrumental in helping the Bobcats secure the victory. With a strong performance from their offense and defense, the Bobcats are now 1-0 on the season and will look to build on this momentum as they continue their 2020 campaign.","The Texas State football team scored 63 points in its home opener. Here's the five key plays from the win.    1. A new school record    Prairie View A&M was trailing 27-3 with a couple seconds remaining in the first quarter, facing a 3rd-and-15 on Texas State’s 43 yard-line. The Panthers punted in order to pin the Bobcats in their own territory, but their plan was foiled by Brandon McDowell, sophomore cornerback.    McDowell fielded the punt and found some space to make a play. The sophomore ran past a couple of Panthers and all of a sudden a lane opened up for him. McDowell broke some tackles, and ankles, and took the punt across the field for a 95-yard punt return for a touchdown. McDowell is behind Brandon Smith, senior wide receiver, for punt returns, but after a return like this, Smith might be looking over his shoulder.    2. Second chance    It took 88 seconds for Texas State to get on the board. Another touchdown followed less than two minutes later. The opportunity was created because Damani Alexcee, junior safety, forced a fumble that Trey McGowan, senior linebacker, recovered at Texas State’s 39-yard line. The fumble recovery opened up the game entirely by gifting another possession to the Bobcats.    3. Back on track    Robert Lowe, senior running back, scored the first touchdown of the game with 13:32 remaining in the first quarter. The touchdown was set up by a 49-yard completion to Jafus Gains, senior wide receiver, that put the team on the five-yard line. This drive set the tone for the rest of the game as Texas State showed their dominance all night over Prairie View A&M. Lowe rushed to the left side with ease and gave Texas State a 7-0 lead.    4. Bowling ball    On third 3rd-and-3 in the redzone, Texas State went to Chris Nutall, senior running back. Nutall did enough to get the first down but he found more running room and took his carry into the end zone for six points. Nutall’s score gave Texas State a 14-0 lead with 9:54 left in the first quarter. All hopes of an upset for Prairie View A&M were diminishing after the score. The drive was the Bobcats’ second of the game and their high powered offense was on display early on in the game.    5. Going long    The play started off looking like an option play with Tyler Jones, junior quarterback, but he pulled back from the option. Smith was wide-open in the secondary. The senior wide receiver hauled in the pass from Jones and the Panthers secondary was nowhere in sight. Smith took the catch for a 65-yard touchdown. The touchdown gave the team a 20-0 lead in the game. It was the first of three passing touchdowns for Jones."

Budget cuts have left forces struggling to cover patrols, with some areas having no police presence at all.

He urged ministers to provide more financial support to help police tackle rising crime levels.","Daily Mail  Sunday 27th September, 2015    'We're too broke to go on the beat': Police chiefs warn ministers that cuts mean they can't do their job as they threaten to stop street patrols and say they won't be able to protect public from rioters or terrorists?...
