0,"A group of veterans in Worcester have come together to form a breakfast club that is not only providing a hearty meal to those in need, but also a sense of community and support. The breakfast club, which meets regularly at a local church, aims to combat the issue of food insecurity among veterans. Many of the participants have faced challenges such as unemployment, homelessness, and mental health issues, which can make it difficult to access regular meals. The club provides a warm plate of breakfast, including bacon, eggs, toast, and coffee, to anyone who shows up. But it’s not just about the food. The group offers a welcoming and non-judgmental space for veterans to connect with one another and share their experiences. One regular attendee, John, says that the breakfast club has made a huge difference in his life. “I was really struggling to make ends meet after I left the military,” he explains. “The breakfast club has helped me get back on my feet and connect with other veterans who understand what I’ve been through.” Another veteran, Sarah, agrees. “It’s not just the food,” she says. “It’s the sense of community and support that I’ve found here. We all have different experiences, but we share a common bond.” The breakfast club is run entirely by volunteers, many of whom are veterans themselves. They see it as a way to give back to their community and help others who have served their country. One volunteer, Tom, says that the sense of camaraderie among the volunteers is as important as the support they offer to the veterans who attend. “We all have a shared sense of purpose,” he explains. “It’s not just about the breakfast. It’s about making a difference in someone’s life.” The breakfast club has received support from a number of local organizations, including the Worcester Food Bank and the Royal British Legion. But they are always looking for more help, whether it’s volunteers or donations. “We want to be able to provide this service for as long as there is a need,” says volunteer coordinator Jane. “We’re grateful for any support we can get.” If you’re a veteran in Worcester who is in need of a warm meal and a supportive community, the breakfast club meets every Wednesday morning from 9-11am at the St. John’s Church on the Tything. Or, if you’d like to volunteer or donate, you can contact the organizers through their Facebook page. For these veterans, the breakfast club is more than just a meal. It’s a lifeline, a way to combat the isolation and uncertainty that can come with leaving the military. And with the continued support of their community, they intend to keep giving hunger its marching orders.","VETERANS saluted Worcester's first ever breakfast club for ex-soldiers which won over hearts, minds and bellies. The Worcester Breakfast Club for HM Forces Veterans met at the Postal Order in Foregate Street at 10am on Saturday. The club is designed to allow veterans a place to meet, socialise, eat and drink, giving hunger and loneliness their marching orders. Father-of-two Dave Carney, aged 43, of Merrimans Hill, Worcester, set up the club after being inspired by other similar clubs across the country. He said: ""As you can see from the picture, we had a good response. Five out of the 10 that attended said they saw the article in the newspaper and turned up. ""We even had an old chap travel from Droitwich and he was late on parade by three hours. ""It's generated a lot of interest and I estimate (from other veterans who saw the article) that next month's meeting will attract about 20 people. Onwards and upwards."" He said the management at the pub had been extremely hospitable to them. Mr Carney said: ""They bent over backwards for us. They really looked after us well. That is the best choice of venue I could have made. They even put 'reserved for the armed forces'. Promoted stories The reserve veteran with the Royal Engineers wanted to go to a breakfast club but found the nearest ones were in Bromsgrove and Gloucester so he decided to set up his own, closer to home. He was influenced by Derek Hardman who set up a breakfast club for veterans in Hull and Andy Wilson who set one up in Newcastle. He said the idea has snowballed and there were now 70 similar clubs across the country and even some in Germany. Mr Carney said with many Royal British Legion clubs closing he wanted veterans and serving personnel to feel they had somewhere they could go for good grub, beer and banter to recapture the comradery of being in the forces. The Postal Order was chosen because of its central location and its proximity to the railway station and hotels and reasonably priced food and drink. The management of the pub have even given the veterans a designated area within the pub. Share article The next meeting is at the Postal Order on Saturday, October 3 at 10am. The breakfast club meets on the first Saturday of each month for those who want to attend in future."

2,"As the famous saying goes, ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me."" But is that really true? How much influence do our words truly have on the people around us? Recent studies suggest that our words have a much greater impact than we may have previously thought. Firstly, words have the power to shape our beliefs and attitudes. From a very young age, we are exposed to words and phrases that are used to describe the world and the people within it. Over time, these words become ingrained in our minds and can shape the way we see and interact with the world around us. For example, if a child is told repeatedly that they are 'stupid' or 'lazy,' they may internalize these beliefs and adopt them as part of their identity, leading to negative self-esteem and ultimately affecting their academic and personal life. Furthermore, the words we choose to use can significantly impact the emotional state of those around us. Positive words such as 'thank you,' 'please,' and 'I love you' can uplift and inspire those whom we communicate with, while negative words such as 'hate,' 'stupid,' and 'lazy' can cause stress, anxiety, and depression. In a study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychology, it was found that the use of positive and negative words had a direct impact on the mental health of the individual. The study indicated that people who used more negative words in their daily lives were more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety, while those who used more positive words experienced greater levels of happiness and overall wellbeing. Moreover, our choice of words can not only affect the mental health of ourselves and others, but also the physical health. In an article published by the American Psychological Association, it was found that individuals who experienced high levels of stress and anxiety due to negative words and communication were at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and other stress-related illnesses. The influence of our words extends beyond just our personal lives and into the broader social and political realms. Politicians and other public officials, for example, have the power to influence public opinion and policy through the messages and words they choose to convey to the public. Hate speech and discriminatory language have been shown to breed violence and discrimination towards marginalized groups, leading to a negative impact on society as a whole. In conclusion, the influence of our words cannot be underestimated. They have the power to shape beliefs and attitudes, impact emotional and physical health, and affect broader societal issues. It is essential that we take responsibility for the words we use and the messages we convey, and strive to use our words for the greater good. As the late Maya Angelou once said, ""Words are things. You must be careful, careful about calling people out of their names, using racial pejoratives and sexual pejoratives and all that ignorance. Don't do that. Some day we'll be able to measure the power of words. I think they are things. They get on the walls. They get in your wallpaper. They get in your rugs and your upholstery and your clothes, and finally into you.""","Words kill or give life; they are usually either poison or good fruit. The words we speak are electromagnetic forces that usually reflect our inner attitude. They contain the power of death and life and ultimately influence the world around us. Augustus Woodbury once said, “Scientific men tell us that every sound upon the surface of our own and other planets circulates in endless and ceaseless waves through infinite space. Certainly not less subtle is the influence of our words upon the life and character of the world.” We must always think about the influence of our words before we say them out; “what is my objective in saying this.” “Are these words going to produce life or death.” Proverbs 18:21 declares, “Death and life are in the power of the tongue and those who love it will eat its fruit.” As a matter of fact, words are our input in someone else’s life. We must make sure our input gives life and not death. We are actually responsible for the impact we have on others and our communities in general. As responsible citizens, we must intensify our awareness of the input we have on other people’s lives. Actually, one person can change the course of another person’s life with the power of words. Individual dreams and visions have been aborted because of words of death spoken over them. Homes and marriages have been destroyed because of poisonous words. Companies and businesses have fallen because of words of envy and jealousy. People have lost their jobs because of lying words said about them. We should always be conscious of the life-changing power of our words. Proverbs 19:1 says, “Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity than one who is crooked in speech and is a fool.” We must use wisdom when we speak, by checking our motives, attitudes and choice of words. We must divorce negative patterns of thinking and bring life to others with our words. Words are influencers. One of the best ways we can use words to influence others, is to practice telling the truth. We are living in the world where too often people try to influence others with manipulation, false flattery and deception and spin doctoring. The truth creates trust, which in turn generates influence. The other way we can put our words to good use, is to choose to use words that build in our speech, rather than words that tear down people and society. We should use our words to build other people up, to inspire, encourage and empower, to affirm and bless. Positive words yield positive influence. It is wisdom to refuse to speak words that belittle and demoralise other people around us. When we make a choice of speaking well of others, in-spite of their short comings, then we will have a healthy and far reaching positive influence with our words. If we spread malicious gossip, we are poisoning our own future and sabotaging our own influence with others. King Solomon of ancient Israel said, “When a leader listens to malicious gossip, all the workers get infested with evil” (Proverbs 29:12, the message Bible). We must use the influence of our words to bring peace in conflicting situations. Due to the fact that many people have no understanding of the power of their words, they have caused themselves and others unnecessary pain and hardships. Each and every day our actions and our words impact those around us. The question is, how are we influencing others with our words and actions? One of the best ways we can influence each other is by inspiring, motivating and encouraging each other by what we say. The story is told about how Sugar Ray Robinson changed the course of one girl’s life, Flo-Jo. When narrating her life story Flo-Jo said, “Sugar Ray looked at me in the eye and told me, it doesn’t matter where you come from, what the colour of your skin is, or what odds are against you. All that matters is that you have a dream and you commit yourself to that dream. Do that and it will happen.” She continued and said, “Right then and there, I was sold out. I was just eight years old but I was fired up about what my future could be.” With words, Sugar Ray Robinson, one of the outstanding boxing champs inspired a great change in one girls’ life. Words are powerful, they can inspire those around us to greatness. They can bring hope to the hopeless, courage to the discouraged, comfort and healing to the oppressed. We must speak life to our husbands, wives, children, fathers, mothers, our communities and nation. Paul’s wise advice to the Ephesians is appropriate at this juncture, “Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers.” (Ephesians 4:29). By our words we can build the nation and by our words we can destroy the nation."
3,"Apple fans, rejoice! The much-anticipated iPhone 6s, iPad Pro, and Apple TV have arrived, and we had the privilege to get our hands on them for a closer look. First up, the iPhone 6s. The latest iteration of Apple's flagship phone boasts an improved camera, faster processor, and a brand new ""3D touch"" feature. The 12-megapixel camera is a significant improvement from the previous 8-megapixel camera, and the new ""Live Photos"" feature captures a few seconds of video before and after each image, adding a unique dynamic to your picture library. The 3D touch feature is truly innovative, allowing users to interact with the phone in a revolutionary new way. By applying varying levels of pressure to the screen, users can access shortcuts, previews, and additional functionality within apps. For example, pressing firmly on an email in your inbox allows you to preview its contents without actually opening it, while a firm press on the camera app icon opens up a menu offering quick access to take a selfie, record a video, or capture a photo. Next, we have the iPad Pro, which comes with a massive 12.9-inch retina display and a new accessory, the Apple Pencil. The tablet is the perfect size for creative professionals or those who prefer a larger screen for productivity. The Apple Pencil is incredibly responsive and accurate, making it an excellent tool for digital artists and designers. It even has the ability to differentiate between the pressure applied by the stylus versus the touch of a finger, allowing for precision control while drawing or writing. The iPad Pro also features Apple's new A9X chip which makes it the fastest iOS device to date. Lastly, we come to the new Apple TV. The new model features Siri voice recognition and a brand new operating system, tvOS. Navigation through the device is effortless, thanks to Siri's ability to recognize natural language commands, making it possible to quickly search for content, open apps, and control playback with verbal instructions. The new tvOS also features an App Store, allowing developers to create applications specifically for the Apple TV. The remote control has also received a significant upgrade. It now has a touchpad that allows for more precise control of on-screen elements, as well as a microphone for Siri voice commands. The new remote comes with a rechargeable battery that can last for up to three months, but unfortunately, it does not include a headphone jack, which is a bit of a letdown for those who prefer to watch TV with headphones. Despite this minor downside, overall, the new Apple TV is a great device for cord-cutters, offering a sleek and intuitive interface, and access to a vast library of content that can be easily curated and personalized. In conclusion, Apple has once again delivered three exceptional products that require high praise. The iPhone 6s, iPad Pro, and Apple TV all feature significant improvements and enhancements that make them noteworthy upgrades for Apple enthusiasts. The brand has once again set a high bar for other companies to meet or surpass, and it certainly won't be long before Apple raises the bar yet again.","Just in time for the holiday shopping seasons, Apple has announced a series of hardware upgrades for the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. iPhone's price sees steep increaseAll the Apple announcements Just in time for the holiday shopping season, Apple has announced a series of hardware upgrades for the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. With the iPhone, the company added a feature called 3D Touch, which lets users control some of the software by exerting pressure on the touch screen. The Apple TV got its first big upgrade in more than three years with a more powerful chip and a redesigned remote control. Apple's family of iPads also gained a bigger sibling with the iPad Pro, a tablet with a 12.9-inch screen — much larger than the older 9.7-inch iPad. At the event, I tried out the new products in a demonstration booth. Here are some first impressions: iPhone The 3D Touch capability is the iPhone's signature new feature. Pressing down on the screen starts different actions, depending on how much force is exerted. A light press on an email, for example, shows a preview of the message, and a hard press then opens the email. You can also press down hard on an app icon to open shortcuts to different actions — for example, pushing down on the Instagram app shows a list of next steps, including the ability to create a new post. When you press down hard, the device responds with a tapping sensation. I found the new iPhones pretty straightforward to use. The 3D Touch feature is easy to get used to, and I quickly figured out how to create a new calendar appointment by pressing down hard on the calendar app icon. The new smartphones are also slightly thicker and heavier than their predecessors, though I confess I noticed that only after reading the specifications on Apple's website and not when holding the devices. iPad The iPad Pro's jumbo screen obviously gives more room for content to breathe, but interacting with it still feels the same as with older iPad tablets. The iPad Pro is capable of running two full-size iPad apps on the screen at the same time. The previous iPad Air 2 could run two apps at the same time, but with a primary app taking up a larger portion of the screen. The large device will be familiar to most because apart from its size, it works the same as previous versions of the tablet. The big-screen iPad also felt comfortable to hold. It weighs about 680 grams, which is the same weight as the very first iPad. Apple TV The Apple TV is significantly different from past models. The software interface has a white background and vivid colours, similar to Apple's Music app. The new remote control includes a touch pad for scrolling around the menu and a microphone for finding things to watch using Siri, Apple's voice assistant. The remote also includes motion sensors for gaming. I decided to have some fun by asking Siri to help me navigate content on Apple TV. For example, I tried using Siri to steer a spaceship in a Star Wars game. But that was difficult, perhaps because of my inexperience with the game. I also tried searching for action movies and comedy movies with the remote control's microphone. Siri misunderstood me when I said ""comedy,"" thinking I had said ""comity."" But it did a better job with action movies — when I said ""show me action movies,"" Siri brought up a list of titles including Mad Max and Furious 7. The new remote control is thicker than the previous one, and in this case, that's a good thing. The previous Apple TV remote was so thin that it had a tendency to disappear between couch cushions.

5,"Peta Credlin and Brian Loughnane have been a powerful couple in Australian politics for years, but their future in the Liberal Party is uncertain as speculation mounts over their influence and roles within the party. Credlin, former chief of staff to ex-Prime Minister Tony Abbott, and Loughnane, former party treasurer, have been described as the ""king and queen of conservative politics"" in Australia, wielding significant behind-the-scenes influence. But after their involvement in the party's recent leadership spill, which saw former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull ousted from the top job, questions have been raised about their continued presence and involvement in the Liberal Party. Some party insiders have speculated that Credlin in particular was a driving force behind the spill, and that her close relationship with her former boss Tony Abbott may have played a role in his decision to challenge Turnbull for the leadership. Despite this, there are still those within the party who hold Credlin and Loughnane in high esteem, and credit them with playing a key role in securing the conservative victory at the last federal election. One senior Liberal source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Credlin and Loughnane had been ""instrumental"" in the party's success at the polls, and that it would be a mistake to underestimate their influence. ""They are both incredibly smart, savvy political operators, and they have a lot of respect within the party,"" the source said. Others, however, have suggested that it may be time for the couple to step back from their prominent roles within the party, and allow new voices to emerge. One Liberal MP, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said that there was a growing sense within the party that Credlin and Loughnane's influence had become too strong, and that it was time for a change. ""They have been a powerful couple for a long time, but I think there's a feeling within the party that it's time for fresh faces and new ideas,"" the MP said. Despite the speculation surrounding their future, Credlin and Loughnane have both remained tight-lipped about their plans. Credlin, who is now a political commentator on Sky News, recently wrote in a column that she believed Turnbull's replacement, Scott Morrison, had the potential to unite the party and win the next election. Loughnane, meanwhile, has kept a low profile since stepping down as party treasurer in 2015. There has been some speculation that the couple may eventually leave politics altogether, and pursue other interests. Whatever their plans, it seems likely that Credlin and Loughnane will continue to be a force to reckon with, both within the Liberal Party and in the broader political sphere. Their roles and influence within the party may shift and change over time, but their reputation as skilled political operators is likely to endure, regardless of what the future holds.","Tony Abbott's last word Watch the last press conference of outgoing Prime Minister Tony Abbott in full. PT6M11S 620 349 They're the power couple who have run the Liberal Party back-room operation since December 2009. But Tony Abbott's ousting as prime minister will inevitably lead to his high-profile chief of staff, Peta Credlin, quitting the blue carpet in Parliament House's ministerial wing. Peta Credlin and Brian Loughnane arrive for the Midwinter Ball at Parliament House in June. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen What will happen to her husband, long-serving Liberal Party federal director Brian Loughnane, is less clear. Ms Credlin worked for Malcolm Turnbull during his stint as opposition leader in 2008-09, but the pair did not always see eye to eye and she will not be working for the incoming leader. After her time with Mr Turnbull, Ms Credlin became the dominant figure in the Abbott government, described as a controlling co-prime minister by her critics, lauded by her allies — not least Mr Abbott, who called her the ""fiercest political warrior I've ever worked with"". As chief of staff, she became one of the most high-profile staffers in recent political history. From the first days of the Abbott opposition in December 2009, Peta Credlin was in the room as one of his most trusted lieutenants. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen From the first days of the Abbott opposition in December 2009, Ms Credlin was in the room as one of the opposition leader's most trusted lieutenants alongside press secretaries and advisers Andrew Hirst and Claire Kimball, honing and refining Mr Abbott's laser-like attack on Kevin Rudd's carbon pollution reduction scheme. After just less than four years in opposition, in September 2013, Ms Credlin, a lawyer with years of experience in the Howard government, made the transition as chief of staff into government. But the tightly controlled approach adopted in opposition did not work as smoothly in government. Mr Abbott and Ms Credlin in 2013. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen Public complaints about a "" command and control "" approach taken by the prime minister's office quickly surfaced, and a reliance on slogans that worked in opposition did not cut through in government. In February 2015, when Mr Abbott faced a spill motion in the party room, some MPs were calling for a shake-up of the prime minister's office, and for political veteran Tony Nutt to be brought into the office. Ms Credlin disappeared from public view, for a time, but the complaints soon resurfaced. Brian Loughnane has been federal director of the Liberal Party since 2003. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen But Mr Abbott refused suggestions of change to his office: in his farewell speech, he singled out his chief of staff ""who has been unfairly maligned by people who should've known better"". And now, both exit the political centre stage, at least for a time. Mr Loughnane, meanwhile, has been federal director of the Liberal Party since February 2003 and party strategists told Fairfax Media on Tuesday that, if possible, he should continue in the role. One veteran pointed out that Mr Turnbull and Mr Loughnane had worked together before, during Mr Turnbull's stint as opposition leader, and that a change in director was not ""necessary or inevitable"". That veteran also said the prime minister's office would likely benefit from a bit of ""competitive tension"" between it and Liberal Party HQ. ""It depends on the relationship between the two of them; [Mr Loughnane] has served every leader since Howard. But Malcolm will have to be comfortable with the director – you can't have a situation like [former prime minister] Paul Keating and [former ALP secretary] Gary Gray [in 1996]."" A second Liberal veteran said Ms Credlin was ""very talented and a good manager, but it will be hard for her to stay in the show. I do hope Brian stays on. The most important thing is corporate knowledge and experience."" Fairfax Media sought comment from Ms Credlin and Mr Loughnane. On Tuesday, Mr Turnbull also began the process of putting together his office team. The former secretary of the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism, and of the Communications Department, Drew Clarke, will serve as his acting chief of staff, while Mr Nutt, who worked closely with Turnbull backer Senator Arthur Sinodinos in the office of John Howard, will return to Canberra to help manage the transition to the prime ministership. Senator Sinodinos confirmed on Tuesday that Mr Turnbull would seek to emulate the attitude of Mr Howard as prime minister by taking a team approach, ""and have a number of senior people in there who can provide advice and make sure it's an open prime minister's office, it's accessible and that there are tributaries of advice going to the prime minister,"" he told Sky News. ""The role of the office is not to be a gatekeeper and cut people off; the role of the office has to be a facilitator of contact so the prime minister knows and has early warning of whether there are concerns. ""You don't need the polls if you have backbenchers who are frank and willing to tell you what is going on."" Follow James Massola on Facebook . Follow us on Twitter"

At the time of writing, SMTC is trading around $17.20 per share, with the $17.29 level looming as a key resistance point. This price point has proven to be a difficult hurdle for the stock to overcome in the past, as investors have been hesitant to purchase shares at these levels. A break through the $17.29 resistance level, however, could be a sign of strength for the stock, opening the door for further gains in the days and weeks ahead. Some analysts suggest that a break through this level could propel SMTC towards its 52-week high of $19.08 per share. Of course, the current market environment remains highly unpredictable, and many factors could come into play that could impact the future performance of SMTC. As such, investors should carefully consider their positions and take appropriate action based on their risk tolerance and investment goals. Despite the uncertainty, there are some positive signs for SMTC. The company has a strong track record of growth, with revenues rising by 16.5% year over year in the most recent quarter. Additionally, the company has been investing in key areas of its business, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and other emerging technologies, which could provide a significant boost to its long-term prospects. Of course, there are risks to investing in SMTC as well. One potential concern is the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, which could impact the company's supply chain and operations. Additionally, the stock's valuation may be viewed as somewhat rich by some investors, potentially limiting its upside in the near term. Despite these risks, SMTC remains a stock to watch in the coming weeks, as investors look for signs of whether the company can break through the key resistance level at $17.29. Whether the stock can overcome this hurdle is anyone's guess, but for investors looking for potential opportunities in the tech sector, SMTC is certainly a stock worth considering.","(Marketintelligencecenter.com via COMTEX) -- After ThursdayaEUR(TM)s trading in Semtech Corp ( SMTC ) the algorithms behind MarketIntelligenceCenter.com's Artifical Intelligence Center picked out a trade that offers a 10.19% or 18.98% (for comparison purposes only), while providing 13.67% downside protection.

7,"MyEastTex has learned that a new email chain found by the State Department contains messages sent or received by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The new chain has been included in the forthcoming release of Clinton's emails on Monday, October 21. The email chain involves a conversation between Clinton and her close aide, Huma Abedin, discussing the use of a BlackBerry when traveling. Abedin emails Clinton on June 3, 2011, expressing her concern that Clinton's BlackBerry is not working properly when Clinton is on a flight. Clinton responded by telling Abedin that she should use a separate email address for her BlackBerry when traveling abroad. The use of a BlackBerry for official government business has been a subject of controversy during Clinton's time as Secretary of State. The new email chain could further fuel the ongoing debate surrounding Clinton's handling of sensitive information. As expected, Clinton's critics have been quick to draw attention to the new email chain. The Republican National Committee has seized on the issue, claiming that the new chain raises further questions about Clinton's judgment and national security credentials. Clinton's supporters, on the other hand, argue that the new email chain is insignificant and that Clinton was simply trying to find a solution for a technical problem regarding her BlackBerry. The release of Clinton's emails has been an ongoing saga since 2015, when it was discovered that Clinton had used a private email server for her official government correspondence during her tenure as Secretary of State. In July 2016, FBI Director James Comey announced that Clinton had been ""extremely careless"" in handling classified information but recommended that no criminal charges be brought against her. The discovery of the new email chain is expected to reignite criticism of Clinton's handling of classified information and revive questions about her judgment and trustworthiness. However, it remains to be seen how significant the impact of the new email chain will be, given the ongoing controversy surrounding Clinton's emails. With the 2020 presidential election fast approaching, the renewed focus on Clinton's emails could impact the Democratic Party's chances of winning the White House. Clinton has repeatedly stated that she has no plans to run for public office again, but her name continues to be mentioned as a potential candidate. In conclusion, the discovery of the new Hillary Clinton email chain is sure to reignite the controversy surrounding her emails. Regardless of whether the new chain will prove to be significant or not, it is clear that Clinton's emails will continue to be a topic of conversation in the political arena for years to come. As for the impact of this latest revelation on the political landscape, only time will tell.","Official says 'small number' of Benghazi-related emails By Updated 09/25 2015 06:51PM Copyright 2015 Cable News Network/Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. An email chain between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and then-commander of U.S. Central Command David Petraeus from January and February 2009 is raising questions about whether some of the emails on Clinton's private email server were mistakenly deemed personal and not included among the 55,000 pages of emails she turned over to the State Department. Separately on Friday, a State Department official said a ""small number"" of Benghazi-related emails that had not been disclosed to the House committee investigating the 2012 terror attack had been discovered. In the past few days, the State Department was contacted by the Department of Defense about the Clinton-Petraeus chain, two State Department officials said. The officials say the chain does not appear to include classified information, though an official determination has not been made. The chain included Clinton and Petraeus getting acquainted as well as some personnel matters, according to the officials. It was apparently considered personal by Clinton's team and therefore wasn't turned over to the State Department, the officials said. Most of the email chain was on an old email server Clinton says she no longer has access to, but the end of the email chain contained messages on the private server she used while in office, according to another official. The chain begins on January 10, 2009 and ends on Feb. 1, 2009 and contains less than 10 emails total between Clinton and Petraeus, the official said. State Department spokesman John Kirby said State received ""several copies of one email chain between former Secretary Clinton and then Commander of U.S. Central Command David Petraeus which were not previously in the possession of the Department"" from the Department of Defense and the State Inspector General. ""These emails are now in our possession and will be subject to Freedom of Information Act requests. Furthermore, we asked the IG to incorporate this matter into the review Secretary Kerry requested in March. We have also informed Congress of this matter."" Also on Friday, a State Department official also told CNN that in the process of turning over Libya-related emails to the Select Committee on Benghazi, it found a ""small number"" of Benghazi-related emails that had not been disclosed to the committee previously. These emails are among 925 Libya-related emails being turned over Friday and were found within the emails Clinton turned over to the State Department from her private server. The official said the emails were found because they have now been digitized and are easier to search. Clinton turned over to State her work-related emails from the server and kept emails she deemed personal. The email server has since been turned over to the FBI, where investigators have been able to recover both the personal and work-related emails. The FBI is looking into whether any classified materials were mishandled."
8,"The Texas State Bobcats played their home opener last Saturday and put on an impressive performance against the Houston Baptist Huskies, winning the game 38-17. Here are the five key plays that helped the Bobcats secure the victory. 1. Tyler Vitt's 67-yard touchdown pass to Javen Banks in the first quarter: Texas State's offense started the game strong with a deep pass from quarterback Tyler Vitt to wide receiver Javen Banks. The touchdown gave the Bobcats an early lead and set the tone for the rest of the game. 2. Calvin Hill's 39-yard interception return for a touchdown in the second quarter: Texas State's defense also had a strong showing, with cornerback Calvin Hill intercepting a pass from Houston Baptist's Bailey Zappe and returning it for a touchdown. This play gave the Bobcats a comfortable lead going into halftime. 3. Brock Sturges' 28-yard touchdown run in the third quarter: Running back Brock Sturges showed off his speed and agility with a long touchdown run in the third quarter. This play extended Texas State's lead and demoralized the Huskies. 4. Marcell Barbee's 21-yard touchdown reception in the fourth quarter: Wide receiver Marcell Barbee made a clutch catch in the end zone to give the Bobcats another touchdown and put the game out of reach for Houston Baptist. 5. Jarron Morris' interception in the fourth quarter: Texas State's defense continued to stifle the Huskies' offense late in the game, with safety Jarron Morris intercepting a pass from Zappe to seal the victory for the Bobcats. Overall, the Bobcats put on a well-rounded performance in their home opener, with both the offense and defense making key plays throughout the game. Head coach Jake Spavital praised his team's effort, saying ""I'm proud of how our guys fought and competed today. We still have a lot of work to do, but this was a good win for us."" The Bobcats will now turn their attention to their next opponent, UTSA, as they look to build on their early-season success.","The Texas State football team scored 63 points in its home opener. Here's the five key plays from the win. 1. A new school record Prairie View A&M was trailing 27-3 with a couple seconds remaining in the first quarter, facing a 3rd-and-15 on Texas State’s 43 yard-line. The Panthers punted in order to pin the Bobcats in their own territory, but their plan was foiled by Brandon McDowell, sophomore cornerback. McDowell fielded the punt and found some space to make a play. The sophomore ran past a couple of Panthers and all of a sudden a lane opened up for him. McDowell broke some tackles, and ankles, and took the punt across the field for a 95-yard punt return for a touchdown. McDowell is behind Brandon Smith, senior wide receiver, for punt returns, but after a return like this, Smith might be looking over his shoulder. 2. Second chance It took 88 seconds for Texas State to get on the board. Another touchdown followed less than two minutes later. The opportunity was created because Damani Alexcee, junior safety, forced a fumble that Trey McGowan, senior linebacker, recovered at Texas State’s 39-yard line. The fumble recovery opened up the game entirely by gifting another possession to the Bobcats. 3. Back on track Robert Lowe, senior running back, scored the first touchdown of the game with 13:32 remaining in the first quarter. The touchdown was set up by a 49-yard completion to Jafus Gains, senior wide receiver, that put the team on the five-yard line. This drive set the tone for the rest of the game as Texas State showed their dominance all night over Prairie View A&M. Lowe rushed to the left side with ease and gave Texas State a 7-0 lead. 4. Bowling ball On third 3rd-and-3 in the redzone, Texas State went to Chris Nutall, senior running back. Nutall did enough to get the first down but he found more running room and took his carry into the end zone for six points. Nutall’s score gave Texas State a 14-0 lead with 9:54 left in the first quarter. All hopes of an upset for Prairie View A&M were diminishing after the score. The drive was the Bobcats’ second of the game and their high powered offense was on display early on in the game. 5. Going long The play started off looking like an option play with Tyler Jones, junior quarterback, but he pulled back from the option. Smith was wide-open in the secondary. The senior wide receiver hauled in the pass from Jones and the Panthers secondary was nowhere in sight. Smith took the catch for a 65-yard touchdown. The touchdown gave the team a 20-0 lead in the game. It was the first of three passing touchdowns for Jones."

10,"Politicians all over the world are known for their ability to make promises that they can't keep. Every election cycle, we hear the same promises over and over again, only to see nothing come of them once the politicians are voted into office. It's time for them to give us a break on these empty promises and instead focus on real change that can have a positive impact on our lives. In Tanzania, we have seen this play out time and time again. Politicians promise to improve our education system, create jobs, and improve healthcare, but these promises seem to disappear once they take office. Instead, they focus on their own personal gain, leaving the average citizen to struggle with the same issues they promised to fix. It's time for us, as citizens, to demand more from our politicians. We need to hold them accountable for the promises they make during their campaigns. If they can't deliver on their promises, then they should be held responsible and should not be allowed to continue holding public office. We also need to start holding ourselves accountable for who we elect into office. Too often, we vote along tribal or party lines without considering who the best candidate is for the job. We need to start looking at a candidate's track record and their plans for the future before casting our vote. Furthermore, politicians need to realize that they are not above the law. Corruption and embezzlement seem to be common practices among many politicians in Tanzania, and this needs to end. We need politicians who are willing to put the needs of their constituents first and who are committed to serving the people, not just themselves. In conclusion, it's time for politicians to give us a break on empty promises. We need real change and we need it now. As citizens, we need to demand more from our politicians and hold them accountable for the promises they make. We also need to hold ourselves accountable for who we elect into office and start looking at a candidate's track record and plans for the future before casting our vote. It's time for Tanzania to move forward and for our politicians to start working for the people they were elected to serve.","Listening to politicians campaigning you a picture you get is that after October, Tanzanians will be living in heaven. Candidates’ promises paints a flawless Tanzania in which no one will labour for anything. If you critically look at things which politicians in the campaign trail promise they are going to accomplish if elected, you will be petrified. Anyone with sober mind will be horrified and left wondering on how and when these politicians are going to fulfil these pledges. It seems also that even those who are defending their seats have forgotten that in 2010 they issued a lot of promises majority of which they have not accomplished. They now go out to dish out even more promises. While Mwalimu Nyerere used to tell Tanzanians that they will develop only through hard work, our candidates are competing to show that they have solutions to all problems and these solutions do not entail people working, let alone working hard, to resolve their problems. Candidates are promising each and everything but none of them have been heard telling Tanzanians that they will have to toil for them to earn their daily bread. Making promises to the effect that people will not be required to work in order to better their lives amounts to making them complacent. And this will not only affect the individuals but the entire nation. For the nation to make strides it needs hard working people who will be able to first change their personal lives and then contribute for the national economy. Crave for victory should not blind the candidates and push them to give promises which in actual fact are not reasonable. We should only look back into 2010 and take stock of what was promised and what has been accomplished for us to be able to gauge what promising mean to the individuals and the nation. The promises we have been hearing would need a lot of money to be implemented. But we are not told where this money will come from. Other candidates have started to cite natural gas as one source of money with which they will accomplish their promises. But we know that a better expert’s guess is that the next leadership will leave the office before the country starts to see real money from the natural gas. So, there is no point in cheating the public that gas will provide enough money for implementation of these many plans which we are hearing. Politicians should campaign knowing that this country or its people are not going to end tomorrow. They should practice considerate politics which respect the fact that cheating would only give them satisfaction but subject the country and its people to pointless argony.

The decision comes after a tumultuous few months for Labour, with internal divisions and criticisms over Corbyn's leadership. However, the move has been met with mixed reactions, with some praising Watson's experience and skills, while others see it as a betrayal of Corbyn's grassroots movement.

12,"Sheriff's Department Says San Diego County Roads are Among the Safest in California The San Diego Sheriff's Department has released a report stating that the roads in San Diego County are among the safest in California. According to the report, San Diego County has one of the lowest rates of traffic accidents and fatalities in the state. The report attributes the low accident rate to a number of factors, including well-maintained roads, effective traffic enforcement, and community education efforts. The Sheriff's Department also noted that the county has a comparatively low incidence of DUI-related accidents and fatalities. Sheriff Bill Gore praised the efforts of the department's traffic division, stating that ""their dedication to keeping our roads safe is evident in the results we see year after year."" The report also highlighted several initiatives undertaken by the department over the past year to promote traffic safety. These include increased DUI checkpoints, public education campaigns targeting distracted driving, and expanded use of automated license plate readers to aid in tracking stolen vehicles and locating wanted suspects. Despite the positive news, Sheriff Gore emphasized that there is still room for improvement. ""While we are proud of the progress we have made, we are always looking for ways to do better,"" he said. ""Our goal is to make San Diego County roads even safer for everyone who uses them."" The report comes as California and other states have seen a rise in traffic fatalities in recent years. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there were over 36,000 traffic fatalities in the United States in 2019, an increase of 2% from the previous year. San Diego County, however, continues to buck this trend. The report notes that the county's traffic accident rate has remained steady over the past several years, even as the number of vehicles on the road has increased. The Sheriff's Department says it will continue to monitor and implement strategies for improving traffic safety in the county.","The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said it was a matter of public safety when deputies opened fire from a helicopter on a wrong-way chase suspect on the 215 Freeway. On Friday, a suspect led authorities on a dangerous high-speed chase through surface streets in Fontana and San Bernardino before he drove the wrong way in the northbound lanes of the freeway. He reached speeds as high as 100 mph and deputies deemed him a threat to public safety. Lt. Mitch Datillo said there is a lot for deputies to take into account before firing from a helicopter. ""If you're near schools, if you're in residential areas. We have had times where we fully intended that it was getting to that level and we could not deploy, based on the backdrop and the public safety there,"" he said. But when the suspect jumped out of his SUV after being shot, the car continued to move and slammed head-on into another SUV, injuring three people. A relative of that family told Eyewitness News that he questions the decision by deputies to open fire from the air. While shooting from a helicopter is rare, it does happen. In 2004, a deputy with the Orange County Sheriff's Department opened fire from their helicopter on a suspect who was firing at deputies at a recycling plant near Irvine. Eyewitness News spoke with use-of-force expert and Inyo County Sheriff's Deputy Ed. Obayashi, who said he agrees with the decision to shoot, based partly on the fact of the suspect's speed while heading in the wrong direction on the freeway. ""It could have been worse,"" he said. ""That constitutes an immediate grave danger to the public and that justifies deadly force."" The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Special Enforcement Bureau is authorized and trains deputies to shoot from a helicopter. Ventura County sheriff's deputies are not trained, but after hearing about the deadly chase, officials said they may consider changing the policy and training deputies."
13,"The fight against cancer has been ongoing for decades, and while significant advancements have been made in the field of cancer research, the battle is far from won. Thankfully, there are individuals and organizations who have dedicated themselves to the cause of eradicating cancer once and for all. Recently, a group of people was recognized for their exceptional efforts in the field of cancer research and advocacy at the annual Research and Hope Awards ceremony held in New York City. The honorees included researchers, healthcare professionals, advocates, and donors who have all played a critical role in the ongoing fight against cancer. One of the honorees of the event was Dr. David Agus, a renowned oncologist and author who has made significant contributions to the field of cancer research. He has conducted extensive research on personalized medicine, where treatment is tailored to the specific genetic makeup of a patient's tumor, leading to more effective treatment and better outcomes. Dr. Agus's work has helped pave the way for new cancer therapies, enabling doctors to personalize treatments based on individual patients' genetic vulnerabilities. His research has also led to significant breakthroughs in the fight against cancer and is a shining example of the difference research and innovation can make. Another honoree was the organization, Stand Up To Cancer, which has raised over $600 million to fund cancer research since its inception in 2008. The organization has funded countless clinical trials and research projects aimed at finding new treatments and cures for various types of cancer. Stand Up To Cancer has also empowered cancer patients and their families through increased awareness, education, and advocacy, providing them with critical resources and support throughout their cancer journey. The organization's dedication to advancing cancer research has helped accelerate progress in the field and has given hope to millions of cancer patients worldwide. Another notable honoree at the event was Ms. Stephanie Davis, who has been an incredible advocate for cancer research for many years. Davis, whose father passed away from cancer, has dedicated her life to raising awareness and funds for cancer research through her foundation, The Will Foundation. The Will Foundation has funded numerous cancer research projects and programs, with a particular focus on improving therapies for pediatric cancer. Ms. Davis's unwavering commitment to the cause of cancer research has inspired many others to join the fight against cancer, giving hope to those who have been affected by this devastating disease.

14,"Pop sensation Pink and fellow singer Demi Lovato have been making headlines in recent days after rumors of a feud started swirling around Hollywood. Sources close to the celebrities have been fueling the speculation, leaving fans wondering if there is any truth to the rumors. According to some sources, Pink slammed Demi during a recent interview, causing a stir in the music industry. The alleged comments stemmed from an incident in which fans accused Demi of lip-syncing during a live performance. Although the accusations against Demi remain unproven, Pink reportedly took issue with the claims, leading her to make some remarks aimed at Demi during her interview. Fans were taken aback by Pink’s comments, with many wondering if there is more to the story than meets the eye. Despite the rumors, fans of both Pink and Demi seemed to be divided over the issue. Some fans have been quick to defend Demi, speculating that Pink may be feeling threatened by the young star’s growing popularity. Others, however, have taken Pink’s side, claiming that Demi’s performance left a lot to be desired and that Pink was merely expressing her opinion. The controversy comes at a critical time for both artists, with each currently working hard on new projects. Fans have been eagerly awaiting Pink’s upcoming album, which is set to drop soon, while Demi’s successful acting career looks set to continue with her upcoming appearance in the fourth season of the popular series “Glee”. Despite the tensions, both Pink and Demi have remained relatively quiet on the subject, with neither offering any direct comments to the media. This hasn’t stopped fans from speculating, however, with many taking to social media to voice their opinions on the matter. It remains to be seen whether the alleged feud between Pink and Demi is anything more than just a rumor. With both artists continuing to work hard on their respective projects, it’s likely that fans won’t have to wait long to see what the future holds. Regardless of what the future may hold, one thing is for certain – both Pink and Demi have a legion of fans who will continue to support them no matter what happens. Whether they are friends or enemies, one thing is for sure – both Pink and Demi have a talent and passion for music that will continue to inspire fans around the world for years to come.","AKM-GSI Will the VMAs drama ever end?

15,"Bayern Munich's Dutch winger, Arjen Robben, has been sidelined due to a groin injury that could keep him out of the squad for the next few matches. The club confirmed the injury in a statement released on Wednesday. Robben has been a key player for Bayern and his absence will surely be felt by the team. The winger sustained the injury during the team's training session on Tuesday and was immediately sent for medical evaluation. While the severity of Robben's injury is yet to be confirmed, sources suggest that it may take him a few weeks to recover. This comes as a huge setback for Bayern, who is currently leading the Bundesliga table by six points ahead of RB Leipzig. Robben has been a consistent performer for Bayern, scoring two goals and providing two assists in six league appearances this season. His absence will surely be a blow, but Bayern has other quality players who can step up in his absence.","Arjen Robben reacts during the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying round football match between Netherlands and Iceland. © AFP Munich: Dutchman Arjen Robben returned with a groin injury from the European Qualifiers and will be out of action for four weeks, German record football champions Bayern Munich confirmed on Sunday. The new captain of the Dutch national team did not only suffer a surprising 0-1 defeat against Iceland but he also sustained a muscle injury in his left adductors, according to Bayern's club doctor Volker Braun, reports Xinhua. Hence, the 31-year-old winger will miss the decisive European Qualifier encounter against Turkey but also a number of Bundesliga and European Champions League matches for Bayern. The German giants sit currently on the second place of the Bundesliga standings after reaping three wins in as many games. They host Augsburg at the fourth round in Bundesliga on September 12."
16,"In a move that raises questions about the underlying safety of vehicles produced by General Motors (GM), Houston-based Potts Law Firm has filed 90 new ignition switch claims in St. Louis. The claims are in relation to a defect in the ignition switch of GM vehicles that is believed to have led to numerous accidents and deaths. The defect, which can cause the ignition to shut off while driving, disabling the airbags, has been linked to at least 124 deaths and nearly 300 injuries. The Potts Law Firm, which specializes in product liability and personal injury litigation, has been at the forefront of the legal battle against GM over the ignition switch defect. The firm has already won numerous cases against the automaker, securing millions of dollars in compensation for victims and their families. According to the firm’s founder, Derek Potts, the new claims filed in St. Louis include cases involving fatalities, catastrophic injuries and economic losses suffered by owners of GM vehicles. The plaintiffs in the cases include individuals from across the United States who were injured or lost loved ones in crashes involving GM vehicles with defective ignition switches. “GM has known about the ignition switch defect for years, but failed to take action to protect the public,” Potts said in a statement. “Our clients and their families are paying the price for GM’s negligence, and we intend to hold the company accountable.” The new claims come just weeks after GM agreed to pay $900 million to settle criminal charges related to the ignition switch defect. The settlement, which was announced on September 17, also included an admission by GM that it had misled regulators and the public about the extent of the problem. The ignitions switches at issue are found in Chevrolet Cobalts, Saturn Ions and other small GM cars. While GM initially tried to downplay the seriousness of the defect, it was ultimately forced to recall millions of vehicles worldwide and pay billions of dollars in damages. Despite the recalls and settlements, however, GM’s problems may be far from over. According to Potts, dozens of other firms are also pursuing litigation against the automaker over the ignition switch defect. “GM faces enormous financial liability for the harm it caused, and we believe that our clients are entitled to compensation for the losses they have suffered,” he said. “We will continue to fight for justice on their behalf.”","]]> ST. LOUIS , Sept. 18, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Attorneys from the Houston and Kansas City offices of the Potts Law Firm, LLP , have filed a new lawsuit against auto manufacturing giant General Motors LLC (NYSE: GM) in St. Louis City Circuit Court on behalf of 90 individual victims of a deadly ignition switch defect that led to the recall of more than 28 million GM vehicles worldwide and has caused more than 120 deaths and thousands of injuries. The new claims for serious injuries and wrongful death follow this week's announcement that GM will pay a $900 million criminal settlement as part of a deferred prosecution agreement with U.S. Department of Justice for misleading the government and the public about the company's handling of the faulty ignition switches. The Potts Law Firm represents hundreds of individuals and their families in lawsuits against GM in Missouri courts and other jurisdictions across the U.S. The new claims filed in St. Louis allege that the GM ignition switches caused vehicles to shut off while being driven, prevented protective airbags from inflating, and caused seatbelts to malfunction. The new filing is Patricia Foreman , et al. v. General Motors LLC . Overall, the firm represents nearly 150 ignition switch victims in St. Louis . Accomplished trial attorney and Potts Law Firm Managing Partner Derek Potts represents the families of Tabatha Rogers , 26, and Tara Yates , 27, who died in 2014 when their car unexpectedly careened off a level stretch of highway. Their case is tentatively set for trial in January 2016 in St. Louis . Ms. Rogers lost control of her 2001 Pontiac Grand Am on the day after Valentine's Day on old State Highway 35 in Sevier County, Tennessee . The car hit an embankment before becoming airborne and striking a utility pole. Ms. Rogers died at the scene and Ms. Yates died shortly after at a nearby hospital. Mr. Potts says he plans to prove that a faulty GM ignition switch caused the fatal crash. ""We believe the evidence clearly shows that these young women would still be here today if not for an ignition switch that General Motors knew was defective,"" says Mr. Potts. ""It is extremely telling that airbags in their car didn't inflate at any point despite this violent, fatal wreck.""

17,"The Coalition government's plan to reduce the dividend tax credit is set to hit many Australian investors hard, with some set to lose thousands of dollars per year. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the proposed changes to the dividend imputation system, which would see cash refunds for excess franking credits scrapped. This means that individuals and Self-Managed Superannuation Funds (SMSFs) with no tax liability will no longer be able to claim tax back on imputation credits from dividend payments. The move has been met with strong opposition from retirees, investors and opposition parties, who argue that it will unfairly target those who rely on dividend income and undermine the incentive to save. Labor leader Bill Shorten has also pledged to repeal the legislation if elected, a move that could potentially save retirees thousands of dollars each year. According to a report from the Parliamentary Budget Office, the proposed changes could cost SMSFs around $5 billion each year, with some retirees facing losses of up to $2,000 per year. The government claims that the move is necessary to tackle the budget deficit, stating that the current system amounts to a ""gift"" to all taxpayers and costs the government around $6 billion per year. However, critics argue that the changes will disproportionately affect self-funded retirees and other low-income earners, who rely heavily on dividend income. ""The proposed changes to franking credits will be a significant hit to around 840,000 Australians,"" said Matt Linden, Senior Adviser to Industry Super Australia. ""These are predominantly self-funded retirees, with average balances of around $600,000. The vast majority of these people will never receive the age pension, so they are completely self-reliant."" Opposition leader Bill Shorten has also criticised the government's plans, describing them as a ""tax grab"" that will hit retirees the hardest. ""This is a real blow for retirees who have worked hard all their lives and relied on franking credits to bolster their incomes,"" he said. ""These people are not wealthy, they are not big investors, they are just ordinary Australians, many of whom have already retired."" However, the government has defended its plans, arguing that the current system is unsustainable and unfairly benefits high-net-worth individuals. ""There are some individuals who are receiving much larger refunds than they paid in tax,"" said Treasurer Josh Frydenberg. ""This is not what the system was designed for."" The proposed changes have divided opinion among financial experts, with some in favour of the move and others warning of a potential negative impact on the Australian economy. ""The changes would make the Australian tax system more consistent with international practice,"" said Saul Eslake, economist and Vice-Chancellor's Fellow at the University of Tasmania. ""There is no reason why Australia should be different from other countries in this regard."" Meanwhile, others argue that the changes could lead to a reduction in investment, potentially affecting share prices and the wider economy. ""The potential negative impact of these changes on investor sentiment is a concern,"" said Adrian Raftery, tax expert and Professor at Deakin University. Overall, the proposed changes to the dividend imputation system are likely to remain a point of contention in the lead up to the upcoming federal election, with both major parties vying for support from retirees and other stakeholders. As the debate continues, it is clear that many Australians will be closely watching the outcome, with the fate of their retirement savings and income potentially hanging in the balance.","Factional unanimity in the ALP could facilitate any move to dump Bill Shorten as leader. Source: AAP Australians woke to a new Prime Minister on Tuesday morning and feedback from opinion pollsters has been coming in thick and fast. The new incumbent, Malcolm Turnbull, is preferred by up to 70 per cent of voters according to the Morgan Poll and by a staggering 94 per cent of Coalition voters according to ReachTEL. Turnbull is opposed by a somewhat stressed Labor leader, Bill Shorten, who is supported as alternative prime minister by only 24 per cent of voters, according to Morgan, with more than a quarter of ALP voters preferring Turnbull as PM. No wonder Shorten wants to meet Turnbull to discuss the China free-trade agreement — he’s probably after a joint shot for his campaign brochure. Even more tellingly, ReachTEL shows a clear majority of Greens voters — the ones supposed to deliver 90 per cent of their prefer­ences to Labor — support Turnbull over Shorten. This majority support for Turnbull from Greens voters came in a poll held after Turnbull was politically mugged on the way to Yarralumla and forced to hand control of waterways to the Nationals, a move that will cost votes for Nationals candidates at the next election, leading to more of their state and federal seats progressively being knocked off by challenges from Labor, the Greens and independents. ReachTEL also estimates that the election of Turnbull as PM means the swing in Western Australia’s Canning by-election today should be about minus 5 per cent, instead of the 10 per cent predicted by all polls before the leadership spill. A week ago, an upset Labor win in Canning was possible and this result would have been consistent with the seat’s former position as an ALP marginal during the Hawke and Keating years. A 5 per cent swing against the Coalition would equal the personal support attracted by Canning’s former Liberal MP, the late Don Randall, suggesting the Liberals effectively retained all of their party vote. That in turn would imply the Howard battlers are firmly in the grip of the Coalition 12 months out from the next election, in Canning and comparable seats across the country, such as Lindsay in NSW or Longman in Queensland. This conclusion is confirmed by a ReachTEL national poll showing a two-party preferred vote of 50 per cent for the Turnbull-led Coalition, with a Galaxy poll showing 51 per cent. This is an increase of 4 per cent to 5 per cent over the figures under Tony Abbott, and I suspect the Coalition’s standing will improve ­further, given the former prime minister’s net dissatisfaction scores and the likely positive scores for Turnbull. A rough guide to the impact of Abbott on his party vote can be obtained by dividing his net dissatisfaction scores by about five, and this corresponds to an interim sugar hit to the Coalition vote of about 6 per cent. How long the hit lasts depends to some extent on how quickly disaffected conservatives in the Coalition stop sabotaging the new PM before he has had a chance to save their seats from their own poor judgment. It would help if Turnbull’s backers stopped provoking Abbott loyalists by boasting about their hatchet job on the ousted PM as this is a story that appeals to political insiders but not to voters. Cheering on yesterday’s men among the conservatives is yesterday’s man for the ALP, Shorten, who less than a week ago was cruising to a certain victory for Labor with about 54 per cent of the two-party preferred despite net satisfaction ratings almost as bad as those of Abbott. Complacency on the part of Labor and the timidity of its leadership left the party reliant on the visceral dislike of Abbott among key groups to insulate Labor from the Greens in the ALP’s inner-city seats and to make gains in marginal urban seats, especially in Victoria and South Australia. This strategy became redundant within 24 hours of Abbott’s demise as many of the middle-class and professional voters Shorten thought were in the bag switched their support to the new Turnbull government. Now Shorten is Turnbull’s greatest asset and the Prime Minister should do everything he can to ensure the Opposition Leader survives until the next election. My profiles of elections back to 1966 make it clear that Labor gains broad-based community support when it develops credible economic and social policies for working families in provincial cities and outer suburbs, and for middle-class families in marginal urban seats. Labor has been able to build on this foundation and go on to win elections when it has chosen leaders capable of articulating these policies during an extended period of opposition and making them relevant to key groups in marginal seats. Shorten’s insipid leadership means Labor has done neither — and now it may be too late. The party’s first problem is the rules put in place by Kevin Rudd to protect the leader from caucus challenges. If Shorten’s net satisfaction scores don’t improve and the ALP’s vote begins to decline towards 45 per cent, Labor will be looking to dump him as quickly and as quietly as possible. But the rule changes make it potentially harder — unless there’s a complete agreement across all the factions to ignore the rules, in effect, and let the caucus get on with it. This means a challenge could become a protracted and public fight, which would hurt Labor’s vote even further. If the factions agreed Shorten had to go, his replacement would be difficult to find as the factional gene pool in the ALP is so shallow, there are no natural leaders who seem capable of dominating Turnbull in parliamentary or public debates. Even with a competent leader, Labor and the union movement have a long-running problem in rebuilding the support base they once had among skilled blue-collar men in Labor’s safer urban seats and in outer urban marginals such as Canning. To become PM you need to be able to control a majority of seats on the floor of the House of Representatives, and it helps to win more than 50 per cent of the vote, but you don’t need it if you can win more than 50 per cent of the votes in more than half the seats. If you win the votes in the right seats the swing pendulum also becomes meaningless because it’s ­really only a retrospective device to measure what happened and does not predict what can happen. In 1998, the ALP needed a two-party preferred swing of about 4 per cent to win a majority of seats on the pendulum and it actually managed a swing of 5.1 per cent, yet that left it still needing a swing of 0.8 per cent to win. This is because winning votes in your opponents’ key seats reshuffles the seats along the pendulum even if the swing doesn’t change. John Howard achieved this in 1998 by winning support from traditional Labor-voting welfare recipients and skilled blue-collar tradies in seats such as Canning. Profiling of elections back to 1966 shows that the Labor vote from tradies trended downwards from 1980 and split about 50-50 between Labor and the Coalition in 2004. The tradies profile for Labor bounced back a little in 2007 and 2010, but once more split 50-50 in 2013. Should that remain the case next year, the Coalition is likely to continue to maintain a lead of about 6 per cent among men. The decline in support for the ALP among blue-collar men during the 1980s and 90s was counterbalanced by an increase in the ALP vote among women. The female ALP vote rose in proportion to the increase in women’s workforce participation rates, which went up from 34 per cent in 1961 to 53 per cent in 1993. The two-party preferred ALP vote among women pulled ahead of the equivalent figure for men in the early 80s, with many crossing to Labor via the Australian Democrats. The ALP’s primary vote from women is now consistently about six points ahead of its primary vote from men. Politically this means that, since 2001, you would be likelier to find a safe Labor seat dominated by female clerks than by male tradies, and you would be just as likely to find a Labor seat dominated by female professionals as male tradies. This increased participation in the workforce by clerical and professional women has had a big pay-off for unions. Just as Labor’s power base became more feminised and shifted its centre of gravity from traditional outer urban seats to move closer to the goat cheese circle, so too did the power base for the union movement. While the proportion of male union members in the private sector continues to decline, the proportion of female union members in the public sector has remained steady, although it temporarily rose in tandem with Rudd and Wayne Swan’s stimulus in 2009. Public sector jobs in administration, education and health are keeping the union movement afloat, and these three industries in both sectors now account for 52 per cent of all union members. These workers have been easily persuaded by their union officials to support quotas for union members in hospitals and schools, and this focus on membership growth rather than outcomes for patients and students requires a lot of public spending and commensurately higher taxes, which of course hit private sector blue-collar jobs for blokes. This is why Labor was incapable of cutting public spending under Rudd and Julia Gillard, and why the ACTU has been desperate to secure the election of another big-spending Labor government under a weak leader who considers themselves to be dependent on union support. The evidence, however, shows that although more than half of the extra million jobs created by Labor were in public administration, education and health, there was no political return for Rudd in 2013 in terms of bigger swings to Labor from electorates containing larger numbers of voters working in these industries. Labor’s lead among female voters comes from the seats domin­ated by the 50 per cent of employed women in full-time jobs. They voted Labor in 2013 and swung to Labor, irrespective of their industry or union membership. The other 50 per cent of working women in the more vulnerable part-time jobs live in the aspirational middle-class seats that voted strongly for the Coalition and swung to Abbott. These tend to be the women who temporarily have given up full-time work to have children and who are seeking to re-enter the workforce by juggling childcare and effective marginal tax rates to help pay off a family mortgage and send their children to the best school they can afford. They have high levels of debt and spending, and they tend to cluster in similarly priced housing estates in marginal seats. They were political gold when I first profiled them in the early 70s and they are still political gold in the present undernourished Labor market. The challenge for Turnbull in selecting his new ministry is primarily to protect his base vote among Howard battlers. He can do this by selecting an industrial relations minister who can relate directly to blue-collar working men, and a welfare minister who doesn’t poke sticks at the huge numbers of welfare recipients clustered in outer urban and provincial seats, as these voters don’t consider living in relative poverty as an entitlement. To regain a degree of parity among middle-class and professional women, Turnbull clearly needs to select more of them as members of his cabinet — including women who understand what it’s like to hand over a crying toddler at the childcare centre or comb the headlice out of their four-year-old after kindy, all to pay off the mortgage, save for school fees and help provide a better life for their families. If he can do that, balance the budget and generate 220,000 jobs a year, winning the next election against whoever is leading the ALP at the time should be a cinch. I wish him well. However you vote at present, given the state of our economy and our labour ­market, we all need Turnbull to succeed.

18,"It's a Mad world at the Melbourne Bar, as long as you're a man The Melbourne Bar, located in the bustling city of Melbourne, is a popular destination for many patrons. However, recent reports have shed light on the bar's discriminatory practices. It seems that the bar only allows men to enter its doors, leaving women out in the cold. This has caused many to question how such practices could be allowed to continue in a modern society. According to sources, the Melbourne Bar has a strict policy of only allowing men inside, leaving women to either wait outside or go elsewhere. This policy has sparked outrage in the community, with many calling for the bar to change its ways. One woman who tried to enter the bar, only to be turned away, spoke of her disappointment. ""It's ridiculous that in this day and age, a bar can still operate with such discriminatory policies. I was shocked when I was told that I couldn't come in simply because I'm a woman,"" she said. The bar's policy has also caught the attention of local authorities, who have promised to investigate the matter. The Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission has released a statement saying that it will be looking into the allegations made against the bar. ""The commission takes any allegations of discrimination very seriously and will be investigating the matter to determine if any laws have been broken,"" the statement read. Discrimination against women is not only illegal, it is also morally wrong. The fact that a business like the Melbourne Bar still operates with such discriminatory policies is concerning and highlights the need for more action to be taken to address gender equality issues in our society. The bar's policy not only affects women, but also harms men. The idea that men should only socialize with other men is outdated and perpetuates harmful stereotypes. It reinforces a toxic masculinity that is damaging to both men and women. Furthermore, excluding women from the bar only contributes to the creation of an unsafe and intimidating environment for those men who do enter. By creating a space that is exclusively for men, the bar is sending a message that it is okay for men to behave in ways that are disrespectful to women. It's time for the Melbourne Bar to change its ways and start treating all people equally. Gender should not be a barrier to entry at any establishment, and it's unacceptable that a bar operating in the heart of a modern city should still use discriminatory practices. This issue is not isolated to the Melbourne Bar. Across the world, women face discrimination on a daily basis. From wage inequality to sexual harassment, there is still a long way to go for gender equality to be achieved. The Melbourne Bar's policy is just one example of how far we still have to go. It is important that we continue to push for change and challenge discriminatory practices wherever we see them. Every person deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their gender. The Melbourne Bar has a choice: to continue with its discriminatory policies or to take steps to create a more inclusive environment. Let's hope that the owners choose the latter and help to create a world where everyone is welcome, regardless of their gender.","Have you ever felt like trading in the politically correct strictures of the mordern office for the world of Mad Men? Have you ever felt like trading in the politically correct strictures of our modern day office environment for the world of Mad Men? It still exists, apparently, if you are a Melbourne barrister. That was the gist of a very non-PC marketing campaign by the trouble-prone financial services shop, IOOF. A male adviser at its subsidiary, Shadforth Financial Group, sent the email soliciting for financial planning business from Melbourne's barrister community. According to an article in Lawyers Weekly, it had a very specific idea about who our ""typical barrister"" is. Let's just say that the girls and boys have very specific roles. According to the article, ""After marrying their 'school sweetheart' in their 30s, he suggested barristers in their 40s are likely to find themselves in the following position – 'Your wife is a 'home engineer', managing two children under 10, and you are finding the 'cottage' which was never quite finished is becoming a little crowded'."" Things are better by the time this archetypal barrister hits his 50s. His career is established and ""your wife has gone back to part-time work and the money flow is good for a while"". The report said several barristers had complained about this stereotype of a very male Bar with stay-at-home wives. ""Are we not thrust back to the beginnings of Mad Men?"" an anonymous QC told the publication. A Shadforth​ spokesperson told Lawyers Weekly: ""This does not reflect the view of Shadforth​ and is not the Shadforth​ way."" It won't be help Shadforth's​ parent, IOOF, which needs all the legal help it can get. The ASX-listed company has faced a Senate grilling, and an investigation from ASIC over allegations of front running, insider trading and faulty research reports. Degree of pain CBD would like to admit that we might have been a tad unappreciative of just what the Hawke-Keating era minister, John Dawkins, achieved during his all-too brief stint chairing education dunce, Vocation. Much has been written about the disastrous unravelling of its business, and carnage for investors who were flogged the stock at more than $3 a pop. It is now worth 10¢. Good thing they have the luxury of three different class actions at their disposal. But they should have known better. The risks were all reported in the previous annual report signed by Dawkins, according to his replacement in the chair, Doug Halley. In this year's report, Halley referred to last year's effort saying: ""Our annual report also referred to risks that might restrict Vocation's ability to deliver on its strategy. With hindsight, two of these risks – the company's dependence on the support of government funding, and damage to its brand – were prescient."" That is one way of putting it. There is some good news for investors. The new chief executive, Stewart Cummins, said he plans new initiatives to get the company back on track like, ""build a strong management team"" and upgrade its systems ""to provide accurate management information"". Wow, why didn't they think of this before the IPO in December 2013. The most sobering information is that the company paid out a $9.5 million dividend pre IPO, and another $6.5 million in 2014. That is $16 million in cash dividends for a company now worth $23 million. NAB's Poach ASIC's national media manager, Andre Khoury, will be playing on the other side of the fence, taking up a position with NAB next month. But NAB confirmed that he will not be working with its wealth boss, Andrew Hagger. It is an important point given Hagger has been moonlighting for ASIC thanks to the bank's wealth fiasco. In March this year, a Senate committee heard how Hagger has had to check no fewer than five ASIC media releases that had been sent to the bank in draft form. ""Our practice of sending media releases to external entities has been that, with a negotiated outcome – and only with a negotiated outcome such as an Enforceable Undertaking – ASIC will generally provide the party with our media release shortly ahead of publication,"" explained Khoury's current boss, Greg Medcraft​.

They unceremoniously dumped its plan to spin-off, and list, mobile phone game maker, iCandy. Fatfish​ said that, after consulting with iCandy's​ board, the ASX, and its own investors, it remains ""committed to pursuing the proposed spin-off and listing"" of iCandy​. To avoid another rejection by shareholders at the next meeting, it proposes to retain a larger stake in iCandy​ and distribute fewer shares to its shareholders. Mind you, its investors might have been reacting to the restatement of Fatfish's accounts last week by its auditors from MSI Ragg Weir. It appears the backdoor listing of the Fatfish business in July last year, via Atech Holdings, did not meet certain accounting standards. This means the purchase of one particular Fatfish​ business should have been accounted for as a cost rather than as ""goodwill on acquisition"". This basically doubled the company's net loss for the year ending December 31, 2014, from $6.5 million to $12.5 million. It reported revenue of $507,310 for that year.

19,"The leader of Iran's parliament has come forward to defend the country's nuclear deal, calling it ""acceptable"" despite recent criticism from the US. However, the US's interpretation of the agreement has been called into question by Ali Larijani, who serves as Iran's Parliament Chief. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Larijani said that the nuclear deal was ""fair and completely acceptable"" to Iran. He went on to say that the country was fulfilling all of its obligations under the agreement and had been doing so since the agreement was signed in 2015. Larijani's comments come in response to criticism from US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly called the nuclear deal a ""disaster"" and threatened to withdraw from the agreement altogether. Trump's latest criticism of the deal came earlier this month, when he accused Iran of violating the ""spirit"" of the agreement. But Larijani rejected Trump's claims, saying that the US's interpretation of the deal was flawed. He pointed out that the agreement did not require Iran to immediately cease all of its nuclear activities, but rather set a schedule for gradually reducing its uranium enrichment capabilities over the course of several years. He also reminded reporters that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had verified that Iran was complying with the agreement's terms. Larijani's defense of the nuclear deal comes at a time of heightened tension between the US and Iran. Earlier this year, Trump imposed new sanctions on Iran in response to the country's ballistic missile program, sparking anger in Tehran. The two countries have also been at odds over the ongoing civil war in Syria, where Iran has backed the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Despite these tensions, Larijani emphasized the importance of maintaining the nuclear deal. He said that the agreement had brought stability to the region and had prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. ""The nuclear deal has had positive impacts not only for us, but for the world as a whole,"" Larijani said. ""We hope that the US will also see the benefits of this agreement and will continue to abide by its terms."" Larijani's comments were echoed by other Iranian officials, who have called on the US to honor its commitments under the nuclear deal. Last week, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that his country could quickly ramp up its uranium enrichment capabilities if the US withdrew from the agreement. ""We have a plan for any possibility and we are ready for any scenario,"" Rouhani said in a speech. ""But we hope that they will not make a mistake."" The nuclear deal has been a contentious issue since it was signed in 2015, with some critics arguing that it does not go far enough in limiting Iran's nuclear capabilities. The agreement has also come under fire from some US lawmakers, who have accused the Obama administration of making too many concessions to Iran in the negotiations. Despite these criticisms, many experts agree that the nuclear deal has been successful in preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. The IAEA has repeatedly verified that Iran is complying with the agreement's terms, and the other countries that signed the deal – including the US, Russia, China, and European powers – have so far upheld their commitments. As tensions between the US and Iran continue to simmer, the fate of the nuclear deal remains uncertain. But Larijani and other Iranian officials have made it clear that they view the agreement as essential for maintaining stability in the region. ""We believe that the nuclear deal is a matter of national security for Iran,"" Larijani said. ""We will continue to honor our commitments under the agreement, and we hope that the US will do the same.""","The leader of Iran's legislature has definite views on his country's nuclear deal with world powers. Ali Larijani says the agreement is good enough. He adds that United States' reading of that deal, particularly when it comes to sanctions, is not good at all. And he's hoping that the agreement brings change in his country — though not as much as many Iranians would want. The lawmaker expressed those views to NPR during a visit to New York. While he is not one of the clerics who hold ultimate power in Iran, he is a consummate insider. He was a top national security official before his election to parliament. His brother leads the judiciary, and the family has important business interests. He is considered a true conservative in his country, and his views open a window into Iran's complex governing elite. Larijani supported the negotiations that led to the agreement, which places limits on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of global economic sanctions. He called the final terms ""acceptable."" ""I believe that we can use this deal as a step we can take to move forward. And at the same time, it is not flawless,"" he said. Indeed, Larijani expects lawmakers in Iran's sometimes contentious assembly to complain. Critics In The Iranian Legislature The assembly speaker met with NPR at a New York hotel. He was dressed in a suit and no tie, in the style of the Islamic Republic. He's in his 50s, old enough to recall all the years from the 1979 Islamic revolution to this historic moment. He has held positions in the revolutionary government since its early years. He now leads a legislature that, like Larijani himself, is considered conservative. He says many lawmakers are skeptical of the deal. He pointed to provisions he considered unequal. The U.S., for example, can make sanctions snap back into place if it thinks Iran breaks the deal. ""But that is not true for us. We cannot return to the situation that we were in the past,"" he said. Larijani sees many of Iran's concessions — like removing the core of a reactor – as permanent. His concerns are the opposite of those voiced by American critics. U.S. skeptics worry Iran is temporarily setting back its nuclear program to get out of sanctions forever; Iranians argue they're setting back their program for sanctions relief that may be temporary. Larijani's anxiety was evident in our conversation. ""If something ... happens in the U.S. Congress, or if there are new types of sanctions on us, then they should not expect us to go — to implement. Or if the Americans don't stay true to their obligations on their part, they shouldn't expect us to do it."" His remark pointed to one of the sticky points in this agreement. It's designed to lift nuclear sanctions against Iran. The U.S. says it offers Iran no assurances about sanctions imposed for non-nuclear issues. U.S. Says Sanctions Remain An Option The United States has insisted it will keep up the pressure against Iran on other issues. In an NPR interview in August, President Obama underlined this point:""We'll still have our sanctions in place with respect to non-nuclear activities like sponsorship of terrorism or violation of human rights."" That matches what Secretary of State John Kerry told NPR shortly after negotiating the deal. He said the U.S. was, ""absolutely"" free to punish Iran for acts like supporting the militant group Hezbollah. So how would Iran respond if the U.S. imposes new sanctions, or reimposes old sanctions, for issues other than nuclear issues? Larijani suggested that could lead to trouble. ""There are different points mentioned in the text that need to be read carefully,"" he said. ""The text said that no country will go after new sanctions."" If Iran views the other side as violating the deal, ""we will respond accordingly."" The two sides may agree on what the nuclear deal says on paper. But arguments loom over what it really means in practice. ""I think there are some people who want to wreck the deal, so they are trying to find new ways to make holes or to perforate the deal, but we are not going to do this,"" Larijani said. But, he added, ""if anybody wrecks the deal in any way, then we will know how to respond to it."" Will Reforms Follow? Larijani's answer to one question was particularly revealing, both in what he said and what he did not say. This was the question: Is there a specific economic, political, or social reform that is likely to become reality now? After all, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has indicated that he would like reforms inside Iran to follow a nuclear deal. ""I think he meant, mostly he meant, economic reforms,"" Larijani answered. ""So, I see very much eye-to-eye with him in this matter,"" Larijani said. ""I think we can make it possible for the economy to thrive."" He dismissed questions about political or social reforms. He said nothing of easing Iran's constraints on personal freedom, or the media, or the Internet. He argued instead that Iranian society is more free than that of its neighbors. Asked if Iran might now free political candidates who've been under house arrest since a disputed election in 2009, Larijani said only that it was up to the justice system. Asked if Iran might free several imprisoned Americans, such as the journalist Jason Rezaian , Larijani suggested that the United States should trade Iranian prisoners for them. A Way To Move Forward Larijani cautioned that the nuclear deal alone might not transform Iran's relations with the West. ""Iran and the U.S. have this past history that is very dark,"" he said. Larijani recited the Iranian view of that history. He didn't mention moments on Americans' minds, like the 1979 hostage crisis, or Iran's calls to eliminate Israel, or Iran's past secret nuclear activities. He talked instead of 1953, when the U.S. supported a coup in Iran. In the 1980's the U.S. supported Iran's mortal enemy, Saddam Hussein of Iraq. Working through this history, the soft-spoken Iranian gradually became more heated. ""I'm not saying that we should live in the past, but we should not try to find dramatic solutions,"" he said, ""and if we see that there is a change in the U.S. attitude toward us, then we can do something with each other."" As translated by his official interpreter, Larijani went on to say: ""You know, these days we are supposed to paving the ground for the ratification and the implementation of the deal. We have to prepare the public opinion for this, but everyday it seems that your secretary of defense [Ash Carter] wakes up in the morning, opens the window, he shouts something at Iran and says that the military option is still on the table. So what does this mean? If you really want to do — to have war, then just go with it. Why are you just talking about it all the time? Why is it that you just talk about it? I mean, does — does it solve anything? Is it of any use?"" A Farsi speaker employed by NPR heard Larijani's wording slightly differently—he did not literally say ""go with it""—but added that the interpreter properly captured Larijani's meaning and tone. A provocative question had led to Larijani's outburst: would he like to invite U.S. lawmakers, many of whom disapprove of the nuclear deal, to visit Iran? Larijani concluded his long answer by saying, in effect, that this is not possible yet. He described the nuclear agreement as a test for the United States — just as the United States has posed the agreement as a test for Iran."

23,"In today’s fast-paced world, people are talking more than ever before – from voice-activated virtual assistants to video conferencing software and social media. But in the midst of all this noise, are we actually listening to what we are saying? Research shows that we spend an average of 70% of our waking hours communicating with others, yet only about 25% of that time is spent listening. This means that the majority of our interactions are one-sided, with little focus on understanding the perspective of the other person. One major contributing factor to this issue is the rise of digital communication, which often prioritizes speed and brevity over meaningful conversation. Short, snappy messages and soundbites may be convenient, but they can also lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations. Another factor is the social pressure to appear confident and knowledgeable, which can result in people talking more than they listen. This can be especially detrimental in professional settings, where communication is key to success. So, how can we become better listeners? One approach is active listening, where we make a conscious effort to pay attention to what the other person is saying, and respond appropriately. This means avoiding distractions, asking questions, and repeating back what we have heard to confirm understanding. Another helpful strategy is empathy, where we try to understand how the other person is feeling and what their perspective is. This can help us to build stronger connections and improve our communication skills. In conclusion, while communication is a vital part of human interaction, it is important to remember that listening is just as important as speaking. By actively listening and empathizing with others, we can not only improve our communication skills but also build better relationships with the people around us.","DO YOU ever find that just when you're about to arrive at the end of your tether, something or someone pops up and manages to reassure you that people are good. Whether you are debating or merely observing a debate about religion or politics, these two topics have to be the most draining. It was a bit like that this week reading the social media spew following the Liberal Party spill. Going by the letters to the editor and the online commentary, the issue of Syrian refugees is a topic that like no other manages to nullify empathy and decency. Reading some of the bile that people write can be truly depressing. Then we have our own Sunshine Coast councillors squabbling about overtime fees passed on to funeral directors by the council should families grieve too long by their loved ones' graveside. ""It's user pays. The funeral director doesn't have to pass it on,"" half of the councillors tried to defensively spout. I have to ask myself, at what point in life do you stop hearing what you are actually saying? Do they know what they sound like? Thankfully, my faith was restored, first when a majority of councillors voted to waive two funeral overtime fees, and, more importantly, when a local man phoned the paper during the week after reading the story of a local Lyme disease sufferer in need of a new wheelchair. ""I'll pay for it, but I don't want anyone to know it was me,"" the man said. That was it. No agenda, no big-noting himself, just a thoroughly decent man doing decent things. If only more people would think about what they give out."

25,"The Los Angeles Dodgers' shortstop position has been a vital piece of the team's success in recent years. Corey Seager has held the starting shortstop position for six seasons, but his days as the team's starter may be coming to an end. Seager was drafted by the Dodgers in 2012 and made his debut in 2015. He quickly became a standout player, winning the National League Rookie of the Year award in 2016, and was named an All-Star and Silver Slugger award winner in 2017. Seager was a key player in the Dodgers' 2020 World Series win, earning the Championship Series MVP award in the process. However, Seager's performance has been inconsistent in recent years. He suffered multiple injuries, including Tommy John surgery in 2018, which forced him to miss significant playing time. In 2021, he is batting just .238 with a .683 OPS and three home runs in 44 games. The Dodgers have depth at the shortstop position with Chris Taylor and Gavin Lux both capable of filling in. Taylor has played multiple positions for the Dodgers, including shortstop, and has been a valuable utility player. Lux, a top prospect who made his debut in 2019, has also shown promise at the position. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has acknowledged the team's depth at shortstop and how it may affect Seager's playing time. ""We have a lot of great players, and we're trying to put together the best lineup to win every night,"" Roberts said. ""Corey is obviously a great player, but we have a lot of options."" Seager is set to become a free agent at the end of the season, and his future with the team is uncertain. The Dodgers have a history of not offering long-term contracts to players who have suffered injuries, and Seager's injury history may deter them from offering him a lucrative contract. If Seager does not sign with the Dodgers, his replacement at shortstop could be Lux or Taylor, or the team could look to acquire a new starting shortstop through free agency or a trade. Despite the uncertainty surrounding Seager's future, he remains a valuable player for the Dodgers. He has shown flashes of his previous All-Star form, and his experience and leadership are assets to the team. In the end, Seager's days as the Dodgers' starting shortstop may be numbered, but his contributions to the team will not be forgotten. The Dodgers have a plan in place for the future of the shortstop position, but it remains to be seen what that plan will entail.","With his home run in the third inning Saturday, Joc Pederson climbed the franchise leaderboard for most home runs by a rookie: Mike Piazza	1993	35 Joc Pederson	2015	25 Del Bissonette	1928	25 PHOENIX >> Corey Seager’s torrid start isn’t enough to guarantee the rookie shortstop a spot in the Dodgers’ starting lineup once Jimmy Rollins returns. Rollins has been unable to hit or play the field in five games this week because of a tender right index finger. Meanwhile Seager is batting .448 with an on-base percentage of.568 through his first nine major league games. He went 4 for 4 with a home run and stole a base in the Dodgers’ win Saturday. He’s reached base in all nine of his plate appearances the last two days. Once Rollins returns, however, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said the plan for Seager “always has been to play him some at short and give Jimmy days, give (Justin Turner) days at third. He’s played more than we thought from the standpoint of injuries and he’s done a good job. While he’s been praised for his defense and leadership, Rollins also ranks last among qualified National League shortstops in batting average (.220) and on-base percentage (.279). The 36-year-old is available to pinch run, but hasn’t been cleared to bat or play the field. Mattingly said there’s no timetable for Rollins to return. Seager, meanwhile, continues to impress. His home run was the second-hardest hit by a Dodger this season at 110 mph. “He just doesn’t make me nervous,” Mattingly said. “He’s got that (Adrian Gonzalez) heartbeat. It’s slow. He’ll live to be 108, I bet.” Mattingly has shunned any questions about potential playoff roster scenarios so far. But with the Dodgers’ magic number to clinch the division nearing single digits (14), the battle for the final NLDS roster spots will soon be a main focal point of the season. Even if he doesn’t supplant Rollins as the starting shortstop this season, Seager could still make an impact as a reserve. “He’s going to be really good,” Mattingly said, “and he is really good.” Puig not in the house Why isn’t Yasiel Puig at Chase Field? Good question. “I expected him to be here, honestly,” Mattingly said. Puig is rehabbing a strained right hamstring at Camelback Ranch in nearby Glendale. He hasn’t played since Aug. 27. While the team hasn’t reported any setbacks in Puig’s rehab, “he’s not working out on the field; he’s working out in water and the Alter-G.” As baseball activities go, Puig isn’t doing any less than pitcher Brandon McCarthy, for one, who’s out for the season following Tommy John surgery on his right elbow. But McCarthy is with his teammates in the clubhouse and the dugout during games. Puig, who’s rehabbing a half-hour away, is not. “Everybody’s invited,” Mattingly said. “All I’m saying is he’s welcome.” Mattingly said that Puig will return to Los Angeles with the team when it flies home tomorrow night. Also Kiké Hernandez (strained left hamstring) ran on the field prior to the game. … Howie Kendrick (strained left hamstring) will get 10 at-bats Monday and Tuesday at Dodger Stadium in live batting practice. He is still unable to run at full speed, though “his time was pretty good, faster than the day before,” according to Mattingly. … Condolences to the family of Dodger Stadium chef Dave Pearson, who died at age 75. He had been battling lung cancer."

27,"A lawsuit is hovering over the construction of the AirEvac heliport that is being built in Boone County. The case, which was filed last week in Boone County Circuit Court, raises concerns about the heliport's potential impact on the surrounding area and wildlife. According to the lawsuit, the construction of the heliport is likely to cause significant environmental damage to the area around it. The plaintiffs are concerned that the noise and disturbance caused by the helicopters taking off and landing could have adverse effects on nearby wildlife, including birds and mammals. Moreover, the lawsuit alleges that the construction of the heliport could violate several zoning and land-use regulations in the area. The plaintiffs argue that the heliport is not compatible with the surrounding residential and agricultural uses of the land. Additionally, they assert that the construction of the heliport would impair the historic and scenic view of the area. The lawsuit names Air Evac Lifeteam, the company building the heliport, as the defendant in the case. The plaintiffs are seeking injunctive relief to halt the construction of the heliport and require the defendant to comply with applicable zoning and land-use regulations. Boone County Judge, Robert Hathaway, acknowledged the lawsuit in a statement to the Harrison Daily Times. He affirmed that the court will review the case and determine whether the construction of the heliport violates any applicable regulations. He also noted that the court's decision on this issue could have broader implications for similar land-use decisions in the county. The Air Evac Lifeteam, which provides emergency air medical services for critically ill or injured patients, said in a statement that it is committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations related to the construction and operation of the heliport. The company also emphasized the importance of the heliport as a lifesaving facility that will improve access to emergency care for residents of the area. The heliport construction has been a contentious issue in Boone County since it was first proposed. Proponents argue that it will improve access to life-saving medical care for residents of the county and surrounding areas. Opponents argue that the environmental and land-use impacts of the heliport's construction are too great to justify its construction. While the lawsuit is pending, the construction of the heliport has been halted. It is unclear at this point how long the case will take to resolve or what the ultimate outcome will be. In the meantime, local residents and officials will continue to debate the merits of the project and the impact it could have on the area. As the legal battle over the heliport's construction wages on, the fate of the project and the potential implications for future land-use decisions in the county remain uncertain.","Glenn Fast has filed suit against the city of Harrison, city officials and AirEvac asking a judge to void the building permit for AirEvac’s heliport currently under construction adjacent to Fast’s Tower Manor property on Main Street.

By adding the new feature, Facebook aims to provide its users with more nuanced ways to respond to posts, particularly those that deal with sensitive topics such as death or illness. The company plans to test the new buttons in a few countries initially, starting with Ireland and Spain. If the trial proves successful, the feature will be rolled out more widely.","Facebook may finally be getting a button that lets you quickly express something beyond a ""like."" Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Tuesday that people have been asking for a ""dislike"" button on the social media site for years. Speaking at an event at Facebook's Menlo Park, California, headquarters that was streamed live online, Zuckerberg acknowledged that ""like"" isn't always appropriate for some posts — about a tragic news event, for example — when people might want to express empathy. Zuckerberg said the company, however, has veered away from making a ""dislike"" button, which could be used to vote down other people's posts. He said the new button is ready to be tested soon and could be rolled out broadly depending on how it does. ___ Online: Highlights of Zuckerberg's Q&A: http://bit.ly/1W1dCam"
29,"New Inflation Estimates Offer First Look at Impact for Taxpayers in 2016 It's that time of year again – tax season. As taxpayers begin to gather their financial documents, the news has come out with a new set of inflation estimates that offer the first look at how the cost of living has changed in 2016. Not only will these estimates help taxpayers budget for the upcoming year, they will also impact tax brackets and deductions. According to the latest numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased by 2.1 percent in 2016. This index measures the average change in prices paid by urban consumers for goods and services, including housing, food, and transportation. Of course, not everyone's cost of living is the same. That's why the BLS also calculates inflation estimates for various income groups. For example, the inflation rate for households earning less than $20,000 per year was only 1.3 percent, while the rate for households earning $50,000 to $75,000 was 2.2 percent. So what does this mean for taxpayers? The most direct impact will be on tax brackets. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) adjusts tax brackets each year to account for inflation. For 2016, the standard deduction for single taxpayers rose from $6,300 to $6,350, while the deduction for married couples filing jointly increased from $12,600 to $12,700. The personal exemption also increased from $4,000 to $4,050. However, these increases may not be enough to keep up with the rising cost of living. As a result, more taxpayers may find themselves in higher tax brackets than in previous years. This could lead to higher tax bills for some individuals and families. Another area where taxpayers may feel the impact of inflation is in the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). This is a separate tax system that requires certain taxpayers to calculate their tax liability twice – once under the regular tax system and once under the AMT system – and pay the higher amount. The AMT was originally designed to ensure that high-income taxpayers with significant deductions and other tax breaks pay their fair share of taxes. However, the AMT was not indexed to inflation when it was first introduced in 1969. As a result, more and more taxpayers are finding themselves subject to the AMT each year. The BLS estimates that the income threshold for the AMT will increase from $54,300 in 2015 to $54,700 in 2016. While this may help some taxpayers avoid the AMT, it will not eliminate the need for reform. Finally, taxpayers may also feel the impact of inflation when it comes to tax credits and deductions. Certain tax credits, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit, are adjusted each year to account for inflation. However, other deductions, such as the standard mileage rate for business use of a vehicle, may not be adjusted enough to reflect the true cost of living. In conclusion, the new inflation estimates offer a first look at how taxpayers will be impacted in 2016. While some taxpayers may benefit from the increased deductions and credits, others may find themselves in higher tax brackets or subject to the AMT. As always, it is important for taxpayers to work with a qualified tax professional to ensure that they are taking advantage of all available deductions and credits while minimizing their tax liability."," Tags: News: Software | AEX:WKL This was published: 17 Sep 2015 - 06:27 pm &nbsp Tweet &nbsp An early glimpse at the income tax picture for 2016 is now available from Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US. The new information includes estimated ranges for each 2016 tax bracket as well as projections for a growing number of inflation-sensitive tax figures, such as the personal exemption and the standard deduction. Projections are based on the relevant inflation data recently released by the U.S. Department of Labor. Inflation Adjustments - Background Since the late 1980s, the U.S. Tax Code has required that federal income tax brackets be adjusted for inflation annually, and inflation adjustments have been inserted into the Internal Revenue Code in recent years with increasing frequency. For example, the Code now requires over 50 other inflation-driven computations to determine deduction, exemption and exclusion amounts in addition to the 40 separate computations needed to inflation-adjust the tax bracket tables each year. Media Assistance Expert analysis plus additional details regarding the following projections and tax topics are available for media members interested in speaking with federal tax experts at Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US. For interview requests, please contact Laura Gingiss ( laura.gingiss@wolterskluwer.com ), 847-267-2213 or Eric Scott ( eric.scott@wolterskluwer.com ), 847-267-2179. Key Tax Savings, Non-increase Estimates for 2016 : Projections based on the Department of Labor's inflation figures for the 12-month period between August 31, 2014, and August 31, 2015 suggest most taxpayers will experience modest savings, compared to 2015 tax filings. For example: Because of the income ranges bracketing the marginal tax rates have increased, a single filer with taxable income of $50,000 should owe $22.50 less next year due to the adjustments to the income tax rate brackets between 2015 and 2016. A married couple filing jointly with a total taxable income of $100,000 should pay $45 less income taxes in 2016 than they will on the same income for 2015 because of indexing of their tax bracket for 2016. The dependent standard deduction, used on the returns of individuals claimed as dependents on another taxpayer's tax return, remains at $1,050 for 2016. The additional standard deduction for those 65-years-old and older or who are blind will remain at $1,250 for 2016, as will the $1,550 additional amount for single aged 65 or older or blind filers. Inflation-adjusted Tax Increase Estimates for 2016: The personal exemption amount gets bumped up by inflation by $50, to $4,050 for 2016, up from $4,000 in 2015. The standard deduction for single, married filing jointly, and married filing separately filers is expected to remain the same for 2016. The standard deduction for heads of household is expected to rise from $9,250 for 2015 to $9,300 for 2016. Any increase in the standard deduction, of course, can produce lower taxes by decreasing the taxpayer's taxable income. Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US projects the following for 2016 alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemptions: For married joint filers and surviving spouses, the exemption will be adjusted upward to $83,800, up from $83,400 for 2015. For unmarried single filers and heads of households, the 2016 exemption will be $53,900, up from $53,600 for 2015. For married single filers, the exemption will increase to $41,900, up from $41,700 in 2015. The 2016 year represents the third year that the 39.6-percent tax bracket for higher-income taxpayers, enacted by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), will be imposed. For 2016, Wolters Kluwer projects that the minimum income amounts at which this top tax rate will kick in will rise to: $466,950 (from $464,850) for married joint filers $441,000 (from $439,000) for heads of households $415,050 (from $413,200) for unmarried filers $233,475 (from $232,425) for married separate filers These inflation-adjusted amounts also trigger a 20-percent tax on that portion of taxable income attributable to net capital gains and qualified dividends that exceed these bracket amounts. The estate and gift tax applicable exemption was first set at a $5 million level back in 2011. The amount has been adjusted for inflation by Congress and is now projected at $5,450,000 for 2016. A spousal portability election can now effectively protect double that amount against estate and gift tax ($10,900,000 for 2016). The 2016 foreign earned income exclusion will increase to $101,300 for 2016, up from $100,800 for 2015. The income phaseout range for married joint filers making Roth IRA contributions will be $184,000 to $194,000 for 2016, an increase from $183,000 and $193,000 for 2015. Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US 2016 Tax Projections * As cited earlier, Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US projections for indexed amounts are based on the relevant inflation data released by the U.S. Department of Labor. The IRS usually releases official numbers by December each year. Tax bracket projections are provided for illustrative purposes only, and should not be used for income tax returns or other federal income tax related purposes until confirmed by the IRS later this year.

31,"According to a new study, calcium supplements have little effect on bone health. The results were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The researchers analyzed data from over 6,000 participants, who took either calcium supplements or a placebo for a period of six years. The study found that there was no significant difference in bone mineral density or fracture risk between the two groups. The study's lead author, Dr. Mark Bolland, from the University of Auckland, said the findings suggest that people should focus on getting enough calcium from their diet rather than taking supplements. ""There is little point in taking calcium supplements to maintain or improve bone density,"" Dr. Bolland said. ""We already knew that calcium supplements increase the risk of kidney stones and gastrointestinal symptoms, but these new findings suggest that the risks outweigh the benefits when it comes to bone health."" According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation, calcium and vitamin D are essential for strong bones. However, the organization advises that people should try to get these nutrients from their diet rather than from supplements. Foods that are high in calcium include dairy products, leafy green vegetables, and canned fish with soft bones. Vitamin D can be found in fatty fish, mushrooms, and fortified foods such as milk and cereal. The researchers noted that their study only looked at the effects of calcium supplements on bone health and did not consider the potential benefits for other conditions, such as preventing heart disease or cancer. However, the findings add to a growing body of evidence questioning the use of calcium supplements. Previous studies have suggested that they may increase the risk of heart disease and do little to prevent fractures in older adults. The authors of the new study called for more research to explore the potential harm and benefits of calcium supplements. Until then, Dr. Bolland recommends that people focus on getting their calcium from their diet and from other sources, such as sunlight exposure for vitamin D. ""Calcium supplements should be used with caution, if at all,"" Dr. Bolland said. ""We need to be cautious about the widespread use of these supplements until we have a better understanding of their risks and benefits.""","Taking calcium supplements or eating more dairy to improve bone health has little or no effect, according to new research. There is scant evidence that taking calcium supplements prevents fractures and no evidence that increasing calcium through the diet prevents fractures or breaks either, experts said. The research, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), collected data from dozens of studies on the issue. According to the NHS, adults need 700mg of calcium a day. It is recommended that people get all the calcium they need from their daily diet. The NHS Choices website warns that taking high doses of calcium (over 1,500mg a day) could lead to stomach pain and diarrhoea. It says taking supplements containing less than this amount are unlikely to cause any harm. In the latest study, experts from New Zealand concluded that efforts to increase calcium intake to improve bone health had no overall effect. ""Our analyses indicate that dietary calcium intake is not associated with risk of fracture, and there is no evidence currently that increasing dietary calcium intake prevents fractures,"" they said. They said calcium supplements have "" an unfavourable risk:benefit profile"", meaning they could do more harm than good. ""Collectively, these results suggest that clinicians, advocacy organisations, and health policymakers should not recommend increasing calcium intake for fracture prevention, either with calcium supplements or through dietary sources."" The experts studied a range of trials on the issue, including people aged 50 and over getting their calcium from milk or dairy, or taking calcium supplements with or without vitamin D. In an accompanying editorial, Professor Karl Michaelsson from Uppsala University in Sweden, said most over-50s will not benefit from increasing their intake of calcium, particularly through supplements, as some recommendations suggest. ""The weight of evidence against such mass medication of older people is now compelling, and it is surely time to reconsider these controversial recommendations,"" he said. Professor Juliet Compston, a National Osteoporosis Society trustee, said: ""There is not much in these studies that is new. We already know that calcium supplements increase bone density, but on their own do not reduce fractures. ""However, a recent analysis concluded that calcium and vitamin D did reduce hip and non-vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women and older men."""

33,"As the Dallas Cowboys gear up for the upcoming season, fans are buzzing with questions about the team's lineup. One of the most hotly debated topics is who will start at running back. Another question that's been asked is whether the fifth wide receiver on the roster is currently up to par. In this edition of our mailbag, we'll tackle both of these questions. First up, the running back situation. Ezekiel Elliott is undoubtedly the team's star running back, but there's been speculation about who will take the number two spot. Tony Pollard had a decent rookie year, finishing with 455 rushing yards and three touchdowns. However, Dallas decided to add some competition in the draft by selecting former Memphis standout, Kenneth Gainwell, in the fifth round. While it's still early in the preseason, Gainwell has been turning heads in camp. He's shown great speed and versatility, and his pass-catching ability has been especially impressive. If he continues to impress, it's possible that he could overtake Pollard as the primary backup to Elliott. It's also worth noting that Elliott has dealt with injuries in the past, so having a reliable backup is crucial. Moving on to the wide receiver position, the Cowboys currently have five receivers on their roster who are expected to compete for playing time. Amari Cooper, CeeDee Lamb, and Michael Gallup are without a doubt the top three, but there are questions about who will round out the group. Many fans are hoping that former 2019 sixth-round pick, Cedrick Wilson, will win the job. Wilson showed flashes of potential last season, but slipped behind Noah Brown on the depth chart towards the end of the year. However, it seems that Wilson has been putting in work during the offseason and has come into camp looking sharp. He's already made a few impressive catches and has garnered praise from coaches and teammates alike. In conclusion, it's still early in the preseason and a lot can change between now and the start of the season. However, it's clear that the Cowboys have some talented players vying for these important positions. Fans should keep a close eye on both the running back and wide receiver competitions as they develop over the coming weeks.","PAUL MEEK SAN ANGELO, TX I was impressed with the acceleration and cutting D-Mac showed (albeit limited number of runs) in this last game. On the heels of this performance, how do you feel the RB competition shakes out? David: Am I alone in thinking that it really and truly doesn’t matter? No matter who the Cowboys send out for the first snap on Sept. 13, he isn’t going to get 392 carries like DeMarco Murray did last fall. I really do believe this will be a committee. Maybe McFadden will lead the team in carries, maybe it’ll be Randle – maybe there’ll even be a new running back in the mix. But multiple ball carriers are going to have a chance to make an impact, one way or another. Bryan: I have gone on record in saying that I believe that Darren McFadden CLINT BOYTE LEXINGTON, KY With no single receiver really stepping up this offseason to grab the No. 5 spot, could you see the Cowboys bringing in someone like Ryan Broyles in a case of maybe he just was never really given a chance? David: I can’t say for sure whether the Cowboys have looked at Broyles – sorry, Sooner fans. That said, I won’t be remotely surprised if the Cowboys’ No. 5 receiver is not currently with this team. None of the guys on the roster have done a great job of stepping up and claiming the job, in my opinion. Jason Garrett and Stephen Jones love to talk about how they’re always looking to improve the roster. If there’s a guy out there who’s a step up from the current options, it’s a safe bet they’ll take a look. Bryan: I am going down that road that the 5th receiver on this club is on another team. As far as it being Ryan Broyles – I don’t think that’s the case. What needs to happen is for this front office located a guy much like they had in Laurent Robinson. To make that happen, this front office might have to flip a draft pick, which I would be willing to do. ©2014 Dallas Cowboys. All rights reserved.

34,"Taranaki-based investment firm Super Fund and infrastructure investment firm Infratil have announced their decision to sell their shares in Z Energy, according to recent reports. The two firms are said to be selling off their combined 41 percent stake in Z Energy, which is worth an estimated NZD 900 million. This news comes as a bit of a surprise as both Super Fund and Infratil were set to take over Z Energy last year, but the deal fell through due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the termination of the deal, the two firms decided to hold onto their shares in the company, but it appears that they have now had a change of heart. Z Energy is New Zealand's largest fuel company and has faced tough times due to the pandemic's impact on demand for fuel. However, the company reported a net profit of NZD 72 million in the second half of 2020 despite the challenging business environment. Super Fund and Infratil's decision to sell their shares in Z Energy is part of a wider trend of institutional investors selling off their holdings in fossil fuel companies. This is because of the increasing concern over the environmental impact of these companies and a shift towards investment in more sustainable and climate-friendly assets. The sale of the shares is expected to take place in the coming weeks and will likely attract significant interest from other investors. It remains to be seen what impact the sale will have on Z Energy's future, but it is clear that the energy sector in New Zealand is going through a period of significant change.","Z Energy shares closed near a record high before the Super Fund's sell-off announcement. Z Energy has requested a share trading halt after cornerstone shareholders Infratil and the Government-owned Super Fund signalled they would be selling off shares in the fuel company. Infrastructure company Infratil said it would start to sell its 20 per cent stake - 80 million shares - from Tuesday evening. The New Zealand Superannuation Fund said it planned to reduce its one-fifth shareholding in the company by 4pm on Wednesday through a sale of shares to financial institutions. The Super Fund announcement was made shortly after the NZX closed on Tuesday so did not impact Z Energy's share price on the day, which closed near a record high at $6.63. However, it said it would retain more than a 10 per cent share in the business ""reflecting [its] confidence in Z Energy's business strategy and management team"". Z Energy shares have been bolstered by a proposed $785 million takeover of rival Caltex, announced in June. Super Fund chief investment officer Matt Whineray said the current market environment provided an opportunity to reduce the fund's large investment in Z Energy ""and realise further value from what has been a highly successful investment"".

35,"Hockey mum on multinational tax revenue. Treasurer Joe Hockey has refused to reveal how much revenue the Australian government is receiving from multinational companies. Hockey stated that he did not want to make the figures public because he did not want to unfairly damage the reputations of the companies. The information was requested by the Senate economics committee as part of an investigation into corporate tax avoidance. However, the committee will still receive a confidential briefing from the Australian Taxation Office.","TREASURER Joe Hockey will introduce ""world leading"" legislation to parliament this week aimed at ensuring multinational companies pay their fair share of tax. IT'S the result of working with the UK government and embedding tax office staff into 30 companies the government believes are dodging their tax obligations. But Mr Hockey declined to say how much potential revenue his draft laws would raise, telling 3AW radio on Monday: ""I would rather under promise and over deliver."""
36,"Police officers in Jersey City quickly caught two men who were allegedly involved in an attack at a local car wash. The suspects, who have been identified as 25-year-old John Doe and 28-year-old Jane Smith, were taken into custody just hours after the incident took place. According to reports, the attack occurred at a car wash on West Side Avenue on Tuesday afternoon. The victim, whose name has not been released, was reportedly spraying down his vehicle when he was approached by Doe and Smith. Eyewitnesses say that an argument broke out between the three individuals, which quickly escalated into physical violence. Doe and Smith allegedly began punching and kicking the victim, who suffered several injuries during the attack. Despite their efforts to flee the scene, local police were able to track down Doe and Smith within hours of the attack. Both suspects were charged with assault and are currently being held in custody. The victim was taken to a nearby hospital, where he received treatment for his injuries. His condition is currently unknown. This incident has sparked concern among locals who frequent the car wash, with many expressing their shock and disbelief at the violent attack. One eyewitness, who wished to remain anonymous, described the incident as ""shocking and terrifying."" ""I never thought something like this could happen here,"" the witness said. ""It just shows that you can never be too careful."" Local law enforcement officials have urged anyone with information about the incident to come forward and speak to police. They are taking this incident very seriously and are working to determine the exact circumstances surrounding the attack. This incident serves as a reminder that violence can happen anywhere, at any time. It is crucial that members of the community remain vigilant and aware of their surroundings, and that they report any suspicious behavior to the authorities. The Jersey City Police Department and the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office are continuing their investigation into the attack. Anyone with information is urged to contact the authorities immediately. As the investigation progresses, many locals are left with a sense of unease and concern for their safety. The community is hoping for swift justice in this case, and for measures to be taken to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.","Two Jersey City men armed with a handgun were arrested Wednesday afternoon and charged with a brazen daylight attack at a car wash, Jersey City spokeswoman Jennifer Morrill said. Jersey City Police responding to the report of an aggravated assault at a car wash on Broadway at around noon quickly identified and arrested the two men, and also recovered a loaded handgun and drugs, Morrill said. Johnny Rojas, 33, of Romaine Avenue, was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, terroristic threats, possession of a handgun, and numerous narcotics charges, including possession and possession with intent to distribute. Alexis Diaz, 33, of Duncan Avenue, was charged with possession of a handgun, terroristic threats, and numerous narcotics charges, including possession and possession with intent to distribute. The victim, a 26-year-old Griffith Street resident, told police two men approached him while he was washing a black SUV and asked him the whereabouts of his cousin, whom they claimed owed them money, Morrill said. Rojas and Diaz then attempted to punch the man, with Rojas lifting his shirt and showing a black handgun to the victim. The Griffith Street man then fled to the entrance of the business and called police, Morrill said. The man provided a description of his attackers to a police dispatcher, as well as the white Infiniti they fled the scene in. Plainclothes officers in the Street Crimes Unit who were working in the area, as well as West District patrol, responded to the Romaine Avenue address to which the vehicle was registered, Morrill. Police saw the vehicle parked at the home and eventually spotted Rojas and a third individual, Hector Poll-Ortiz, walking on Broadway. When officers approached the two men, they saw the handle of a handgun sticking out of Rojas' waistband, Morrill said. When one officer yelled ""gun,"" Rojas attempted to turn around and flee but was forced to the ground. A loaded, black Remington semi-automatic handgun was recovered from Rojas, who was also in possession of $468 in cash and the keys to the Infiniti, the spokeswoman said. Meanwhile, Diaz was spotted walking nearby with cuts on his hand. Due to the proximity of the crime location and the apprehension of Rojas, officers detained Diaz, who was later identified as the second attacker from the car wash. While the car was being impounded, officers found six bags of suspected CDS cocaine in the cup holder in the middle console, Morrill said. Poll-Ortiz, who was not charged in connection with the car wash attack, was arrested on an open Hudson County Sheriff's Office warrant and was turned over to that agency for processing, Morrill added."
37,"The city of Yokohama is buzzing with excitement as it welcomes the Scottish Rugby Team ahead of the much-anticipated 2019 Rugby World Cup that kicks off tomorrow. Scotland, one of the favourites to lift the Webb Ellis Cup, has arrived in Yokohama, where they will play their opening match against Ireland at the International Stadium tomorrow.

The team will be based at Hartpury College for the next few days ahead of the start of their World Cup campaign at Kingsholm Stadium in Gloucester on Wednesday when they face Japan. The ceremony was a celebration of Scotland Rugby's achievements and included their friends and family as well as members of the local community. They arrived to a greeting from a choir from Isbourne Valley School performing official tournament anthem `World In Union` in front of an audience including figures from World Rugby, England Rugby 2015 and the Rugby Football Union. Paul James, leader of Gloucester City Council, presented the team with a special mini Scrumpty as a gift from the city. He said: ""It is an immense honour to welcome the Scotland Rugby team to the city and a huge privilege for Gloucester to be a host city for the third largest sporting event in the world."" Following welcome speeches from chairman of England Rugby 2015 Andrew Cosslett and Scotland manager Gavin Scott, each member of the team was presented with a Tournament cap and Rugby World Cup 2015 participation medal. There were four cap and medal bearers who were selected from local clubs and educational institutions, representing the legacy of Rugby World Cup 2015. Speaking during the ceremony, Scotland captain Greig Laidlaw who also plays for Gloucester Rugby, said: ""I am so proud to stand here as Scotland captain. It has been months, if not years, of hard work in preparing for this event. ""To all the people of Gloucester it is great to be here. I joined the club just over a year ago and I have really enjoyed getting to know the city. ""I have been explaining to the boys how much you love rugby and they could see it as we drove through the city. But I have one small plea. ""Japan will be playing in cherry and white on Wednesday so for once please could you put that to one side. It would be much appreciated. ""We look forward to seeing you all at Kingsholm on Wednesday."" The ceremony culminated with a beat-boxing performance by local act Duke. Gloucester Cathedral is among 17 landmark venues across England and Wales chosen to host Welcome Ceremonies. It is predicted to be the biggest boost for the UK's travel and tourism industry since the London Olympics three years ago, pumping almost £1billion into the economy during the next month and a half."
38,"A prisoner at Whitemoor, a maximum security prison in Cambridgeshire, has reportedly been kept in solitary confinement for over two years. The inmate, known only as ""Prisoner A"", had been placed in the Close Supervision Centre (CSC) due to his behavior, but has remained there far longer than the intended 13-week limit. According to a report by the BBC's Panorama, Prisoner A has been kept in a small, windowless cell for 23 and a half hours a day, with limited access to exercise or social interaction. The report also claims that Prisoner A has attempted suicide multiple times and has been seen self-harming. The use of solitary confinement beyond the 13-week limit has been criticized by human rights groups such as Amnesty International, who call it ""cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment"". The United Nations has also condemned the use of prolonged solitary confinement and stated that it should be used only as a last resort and for the shortest time possible. The Ministry of Justice has defended the use of the CSC, stating that it is a necessary measure to manage the most dangerous and disruptive prisoners. However, they have also acknowledged that the system needs improvement and have pledged to review the use of solitary confinement and the treatment of prisoners in the CSC. The case of Prisoner A sheds light on the ongoing debate over the use of solitary confinement and raises questions about the effectiveness and ethics of the practice. While it may be necessary to isolate dangerous or disruptive prisoners for the safety of other inmates and staff, the long-term effects of solitary confinement on mental health and well-being cannot be ignored. The UK government has already faced criticism for the treatment of prisoners and the state of the prison system as a whole. Overcrowding and understaffing have created a volatile environment in some prisons, leading to an increase in violence and self-harm among inmates. The use of solitary confinement only exacerbates these issues. It remains to be seen what action will be taken in response to the case of Prisoner A and the wider debate over the use of solitary confinement. However, it is clear that changes need to be made to ensure that the treatment of prisoners aligns with basic human rights and dignity. The use of prolonged solitary confinement should be a last resort, and alternatives such as therapy and education programs should be explored to promote rehabilitation and reduce reoffending.","An inmate at a maximum-security prison has been kept in segregation for two-and-a-half years, according to a report. The Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) for HMP Whitemoor revealed that it detained seven of the 24 prisoners held in segregation for more than six months across England's high-security jails as of June 1 this year. Whitemoor prison near March, Cambridgeshire Inspectors said a staffing ""merry-go-round"" meant inexperienced staff were needed to work on the segregation unit and management was ""poor"". Prison rules enable a governor to arrange for a prisoner to be segregated - kept away from other inmates - for up to 72 hours before seeking authorisation from the secretary of state. Inmates can be segregated if they are deemed to be in danger, to prevent danger to other prisoners or as punishment for disruptive behaviour. The IMB cited a United Nations protocol which defines solitary confinement for more than 22 hours a day as torture and said m any inmates in segregation at the Cambridgeshire jail were often confined for longer. The report, covering the year to May 2015, said: ""Although often faced with challenging prisoners, requiring officers to get into and out of personal protection equipment, on most days staff were able to offer a full regime. ""It was not however unusual for some curtailment to be necessary, meaning that residents might miss showers, corporate worship, phone calls and exercise. At its worst, for example on 10 occasions in April, the Seg (segregation unit) had to be locked down."" The regime in place was ""much the same"" as that which HM Inspectorate of Prisons found in 2011 to be ""inadequate"", inspectors added. ""One of the other problems noted by Inspectors was the poor management arrangements for the Seg. Whilst there have been definite improvements, with greater adherence to procedures and standards, and consistency of decision-making, new prison-wide staffing arrangements meant that the custody manager responsible for the Seg was more frequently away from the unit, for example acting as orderly officer, managing detail or on nights,"" the report said. "" We do not blame Whitemoor managers for this merry go-round, which results from centrally-imposed staffing norms."" A high-profile terrorist prisoner recently won a legal challenge at the UK's highest court against his segregation at HMP Whitemoor. Kamel Bourgass, an Algerian who is serving 17 years for conspiracy to commit public nuisance by using poisons or explosives in relation to the 2002 Ricin terrorist plot, was segregated for extended periods. The Supreme Court ruled in July his confinement, for periods or more than a month, was unlawful beyond the initial 72-hour period. Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved."

40,"The trial of a suspect in the Los Alamos standoff, which occurred in 2018, is currently underway. Deputies who were involved in the incident testified in court on Tuesday, providing key details of the tense confrontation that lasted for several hours. The suspect, 31-year-old John Smith, is facing multiple charges, including assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer and making criminal threats. The standoff began on October 11, 2018, when Smith allegedly held his girlfriend and her two children hostage in their home. When deputies arrived at the scene and attempted to make contact with Smith, he opened fire on them. During the trial, deputies recounted their experiences during the standoff, which lasted for over five hours. Deputy James Davis testified that he was the first to respond to the scene and that he observed Smith holding a gun to his girlfriend's head. Davis attempted to negotiate with Smith, but he refused to release the hostages. Deputy Jeffery Hicks, who arrived on the scene shortly after Davis, described how he and other deputies attempted to breach the front door of the home, but were met with gunfire from Smith. Hicks testified that he narrowly avoided being shot and that the situation was extremely dangerous. Other deputies who were involved in the standoff also testified, including Deputy Gabrielle Martinez, who was part of the SWAT team that ultimately brought the standoff to an end. Martinez described the tense moments leading up to Smith's surrender, noting that she heard him crying before he finally gave up his weapons and allowed the hostages to be released. The trial is expected to continue for several more days, with additional witnesses and evidence to be presented. Both the prosecution and the defense are expected to make their case for whether Smith is guilty of the charges against him. Smith remains in custody, with his bail set at $1 million. The outcome of the trial could have far-reaching consequences for both Smith and the community of Los Alamos, where the standoff took place. As the trial continues, residents are closely following the proceedings, hoping for justice and closure in this tense and disturbing case.","Santa Barbara County Sheriff's deputies testified Friday that they were aware that a Los Alamos man accused of making threats against his sister owned multiple guns when they went to his house to interview him in March, an incident that turned into an hourslong standoff with the department's special enforcement team. Ronald Joseph Carrari, 56, is charged with making criminal threats and resisting arrest stemming from the March 20 incident. His sister, Christina Carrari, had called the Sheriff's Department to report that he had threatened her. Four deputies responding to the report went to Ronald Carrari's house south of Los Alamos, where he refused to come out of the house because the deputies did not have a warrant. Two of the responding deputies testified Friday that Ronald Carrari had said he was going to get his guns. ""I heard him say, 'You got your guns, I'm getting mine,'"" Deputy Jonathan Fleming said. However, Fleming and Deputy Bobby Fortier also testified that they had actually seen him holding a gun. A search of his home yielded eight guns, including one that is apparently illegal under California law, a Taurus handgun that fires .410 shotgun shells, making it a short-barreled shotgun. At some point during the incident, Ronald Carrari, audibly upset, called 911, expressing fear that deputies were going to kill him and saying that the Sheriff's Department had a ""vendetta"" against him. After being arrested under suspicion of making criminal threats and resisting arrest, Ronald Carrari bailed out of jail. He was rearrested after being accused of threatening his sister again several days later. The two incidents apparently stemmed from Christina Carrari limiting the hours that her brother could visit their ailing mother, although Ronald Carrari had a history of not getting along with other members of the family, and his father and his developmentally disabled brother had recently obtained restraining orders against him. Christina Carrari testified that her brother was allowed to visit their mother between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., which she said were ""her best hours."" Other family members were not subject to the visitation hours. Christina Carrari testified that this was due to Ronald Carrari's prior behavior. ""He was upsetting mom as well as wreaking havoc with all of us,"" she said. Their mother died March 18. The second incident in which Ronald Carrari is accused of threatening his sister occurred at a memorial service for their mother. Ronald Carrari allegedly placed a memorial planter box with threatening messages written on it outside of the Union Hotel, where the service was being held. Testimony will continue Wednesday morning."
41,"Singapore-based electronics company IPS has recently released a new gaming monitor with exceptional viewing angles. The high-quality display panel provides a wide viewing angle for gamers who want to fully immerse themselves in their favorite games. The IPS gaming monitor boasts an impressive resolution of 1920x1080 pixels, which enhances visual clarity and displays in-depth images that pop with vibrant colors. The monitor's 24-inch display is large enough to enjoy game immersion without being too large that it compromises the desk space for gamers. The viewing angle on the IPS gaming monitor is simply exceptional, providing high-quality image and gameplay from various positions. The IPS panel technology used to create the monitor ensures that the viewing angle is consistently uniform, regardless of the position of the monitor or the viewer’s angle of view. The IPS technology used in the monitor results in a sharper contrast between dark and light areas of the screen. Brightness and color accuracy remain consistent, even at extreme angles which is an anomaly when compared to other monitors in the market. One of the major complaints gamers have with their current monitors is the limited viewing angle, rendering the image black or washed-out when viewed from the side or above. However, the IPS gaming monitor eliminates this issue, allowing gamers to play from multiple angles vertically and horizontally without any visual degradation. The monitor's quick response time of 1ms ensures a blur-free, seamless gaming experience with no lag. With a refresh rate of up to 144Hz which is faster when compared to some of its counterparts, the IPS gaming monitor can keep up with even the most demanding games. This monitor’s ergonomic design is the icing on the cake. The tilt feature permits angles up to 15° and comes with a height adjustment feature, allowing gamers to adjust the viewing angle based on their comfort level. Furthermore, the monitor's slim design means it will not take up too much desk space, creating room for gamers' other essentials like controllers, a keyboard, and gaming mice. ""Gaming monitors are quickly becoming mainstream as gamers are increasingly seeking an immersive gaming experience,"" said John Tan, a local tech enthusiast. ""The IPS gaming monitor packs impressive features that gamers want in a monitor, most notably the fantastic viewing angles. It's a great upgrade for gamers who want to raise the bar on their gaming experience without having to compromise on their gaming gear’s aesthetics."" In conclusion, the IPS gaming monitor proves to be an excellent buy for gamers, offering a wide-angle viewing experience that creates stunning visuals with no image degradation. With its quick response time and refresh rate, the monitor is ideal for gamers who require quick reflexes and no downtime. Its ergonomic design is also tailor-made to cater to gamers' needs. The IPS gaming monitor is a worthy investment and is now available for purchase in the Singapore market.","The Asus MG279Q is one of two models in this roundup - the other is the Acer XB270HU - to use in-plane switching (IPS) technology. The other monitors use twisted nematic (TN) panels, which have inferior viewing angles. Hence, if viewing angles are your biggest concern, you should be looking at these two models. The Acer and the Asus differ mainly in the variable refresh rate technology used. Asus supports AMD FreeSync, while Acer uses Nvidia's G-Sync technology. The variable refresh rate range on the Asus is between 35Hz and 90Hz. This is not as wide as the Acer (30Hz to 144Hz) and the BenQ XL2730Z (40Hz to 144Hz). However, it is probably adequate as most games should be running at frame rates within this range. If your games fall outside this range, you can probably tweak their graphics settings to bring them back within the range to benefit from FreeSync. Physically, the monitor is fairly slim, with a 13mm-wide bezel. Overall, my impression is that the monitor is not overly loud and should appeal to non-gamers too. You can pivot the Asus 90 degrees for a portrait orientation or swivel it by up to 60 degrees to its sides. It has a pair of built-in speakers and two USB 3.0 ports at the bottom rear of the display. Navigate the on-screen display (OSD) settings with a joystick. The monitor includes six predefined settings, or profiles, that are optimised for different usage modes, from watching movies to playing a first-person shooter game. A demo feature helps you decide whether the selected profile is suitable. It splits the screen into two, with one half showing the original display setting and the other the chosen profile, so that you can see both side by side. A crosshair overlay can be turned on to help gamers aim in shooting games. Screen brightness topped out at 270 nits, making it one of the brightest models I have tested. However, colour accuracy was average with a score of 3 out of 5 compared to 4.5 for the Acer. Several handy features for gamers Gamers will like this BenQ XL2730Z monitor. Not only does it support AMD FreeSync for a smooth gaming experience (with a compatible AMD graphics card), but also it has a number of features that cater to gamers. For example, you can hang your headset on a retractable hook at the left of the display. A carry handle makes it easier to take the monitor to LAN gaming parties. You can plug your headset into the monitor, as it has headphone and microphone jacks. On-screen display (OSD) settings let gamers adjust the headset volume or mute the headset microphone. The BenQ's screen can pivot 90 degrees to a portrait orientation. It lets you swivel 45 degrees to the sides - more limited than other monitors I've tried. The monitor comes with a unique feature that I find useful. The OSD settings can be adjusted using an external controller dubbed the S Switch. The wired round puck, which comes with large buttons and a scroll wheel, fits neatly into a circular indent at the base of the monitor stand. I find the S Switch easier to use than traditional OSD buttons on other monitors. You can also save up to three different sets of display settings, and switch quickly between them using the S Switch. Gaming-centric features include a Black Equalizer mode, which attempts to brighten dark areas of the screen so that you can spot concealed enemies more easily during a game. There is also a motion-blur reduction feature that helps reduce the amount of smearing during fast action games. But both features have their downsides. The Black Equalizer mode makes everything look overexposed and affects colour accuracy. Turning on blur reduction leads to a reduction in screen brightness. So use them with discretion. The AMD FreeSync feature on this BenQ monitor works for refresh rates from 40Hz to 144Hz - the widest range among the three AMD FreeSync monitors in this round-up. Its closest rival is the Asus MG279Q, which has a FreeSync range of 35Hz to 90Hz. The viewing angle is decent, but not as wide as on monitors that use in-plane switching display technology. Nevertheless, the BenQ's twisted nematic screen has good colour accuracy - as long as you do not use its Black Equalizer mode. Lower screen resolution is a letdown The biggest flaw in this Philips monitor is its 1,920 x 1,080-pixel screen resolution. While this resolution is adequate for a 24-inch monitor, it is not good enough for a 27-inch display. In comparison, the other monitors in this roundup have screen resolutions of at least 2,560 x 1,440 pixels. To be fair, the lower screen resolution may be useful for gamers with less powerful computers. They can run games smoothly at the native resolution without having to reduce their graphics settings. On the other hand, the Philips monitor does not look as sharp as its rivals when it comes to browsing the Internet or reading a document. Viewing from the sides and the bottom is poor, though not unexpected, given that this monitor uses a twisted nematic (TN) panel instead of in-plane switching (IPS) technology. There is one upside though: TN screens usually have low response time and input lag. As a result, games, especially first-person shooters, feel responsive. Philips has tried to inject a bit of flair into the design. The display has a red strip in front and its stand has an opening for cables to pass through. You can rotate the screen by 90 degrees to portrait orientation, and swivel the display to the right or left by 65 degrees. However, the bezel looks chunky at around 25mm at the top and 20mm at the sides. A laptop-style external power brick is required. Like most Nvidia G-Sync monitors, the Philips monitor has a single DisplayPort connector. There are no HDMI or DVI inputs. But there is an integrated USB hub with four USB 3.0 ports at the back. Touch-sensitive buttons operate the on-screen display settings. The settings are fairly basic with no profiles for specific tasks. There is an option to display a crosshair on the screen to help players in first-person shooter games. But this lone gamer feature feels like a token gesture. In my test with a colourimeter, the Philips covered 99 per cent of the sRGB colour space. Colour accuracy was decent, but not as good as some of its competitors. At $999, the Philips is one of the least expensive Nvidia G-Sync monitors in the market, though AMD FreeSync models are around the same price. However, the IPS-based Acer XB270HU arguably provides better value despite being more expensive at $1,099. Friendly price tag but there's a catch Of the five monitors in this round-up, Samsung U28E590DS is the only model with an ultra high-definition (also known as 4K) resolution. Its rivals have a screen resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 pixels or fewer. Yet, it is one of the more affordable monitors at $899. Only the BenQ XL2730Z is cheaper ($888). But there is a catch. The Samsung monitor uses a twisted nematic (TN) panel with viewing angles that are not as wide as other displays based on in-plane switching (IPS) technology. The bottom viewing angle is especially bad, with significant colour shift. Samsung has tried to remedy this inherent weakness in TN displays with an image enhancement feature dubbed Samsung Magic Angle. This feature offers five different profiles, each designed to alleviate the poor viewing angles of the display for specific scenarios. For instance, Group View is intended for multiple viewers while Lean Back tries to improve the viewing experience when looking at the display from below. In practice, Magic Angle works pretty well - so much so that I could almost forget that this is a monitor with a TN display. The Samsung scored well in our colour accuracy test. I also like that it comes with a joystick for users to adjust the on-screen display settings. It is easier to use than the usual buttons. However, you will need a high-end gaming system to get the most out of this monitor. Unlike its rivals, the Samsung has a very limited FreeSync range (40 to 60Hz). This means that unless your game is running between 40 and 60 frames per second, it will not benefit from FreeSync. To achieve such consistent frame rates in the latest games at 3,840 x 2,160 pixels requires a powerful computer, such as one with dual graphics cards. It is not a deal-breaker if you have a high-end system, but keep this in mind if you are buying the monitor solely for the FreeSync feature. Other flaws that may put you off: The monitor lacks pivot and swivel functionality and it also has no USB ports."
42,"The first presidential debate of the 2020 election cycle took place on September 29th, and it's safe to say that it was nothing short of chaotic. President Donald Trump faced-off against Democratic nominee Joe Biden in a debate that was filled with interruptions and personal attacks. Trump's performance during the debate has been a hot topic for discussion since the event, with pundits and analysts weighing in on his performance. So, how did Trump do in the debate? From an objective standpoint, Trump failed to deliver a coherent message or argument during the debate. Instead, he chose to interrupt and attack Biden at every opportunity. His demeanor was aggressive and confrontational, which led to a lack of productive discussion on important issues facing the nation. On the other hand, Trump did manage to raise some valid points on topics such as the economy and healthcare. However, these points were largely overshadowed by his negative behavior throughout the debate. Overall, it's difficult to argue that Trump performed well during the debate. His aggressive style and lack of focus made it difficult for him to make a lasting impact on voters. The chaotic nature of the debate meant that important issues were not discussed, and Americans were left wondering what the future of their country will look like. In conclusion, Trump's performance during the first presidential debate was unimpressive, and it remains to be seen whether or not he will be able to improve in future debates.","(Before It's News) How did Trump do in the debate?

43,"Homeowners looking to save money on their annual insurance premiums may want to consider skipping some cosmetic repairs, according to industry experts. Home insurance rates are based on a number of factors, including the condition of the property. However, many homeowners may not realize that cosmetic features, such as chipped paint or an outdated kitchen, can also have an impact on their insurance rates. By forgoing some of these types of cosmetic repairs, homeowners could potentially lower their insurance costs. “While cosmetic features may be desirable to homeowners, they do not necessarily affect the safety or structural soundness of a home,” said John Doe, an insurance expert with XYZ Insurance. “By focusing on the elements that have a greater impact on safety and structural integrity, homeowners can potentially reduce their insurance costs.” Of course, homeowners should not neglect necessary repairs and maintenance that pose a safety hazard, such as a leaky roof or faulty electrical wiring. These types of repairs are not only important for insurance purposes, but also for the overall safety and livability of the home. However, for homeowners who are looking to cut costs, skipping unnecessary cosmetic repairs can be a smart move. “Many homeowners do not realize how much of an impact these types of repairs can have on their insurance rates,” said Jane Smith, a real estate agent with ABC Realty. “By being strategic about which repairs they choose to make, they can potentially save hundreds of dollars a year in insurance premiums.” It’s important to note that not all insurance companies will take cosmetic repairs into account when setting rates. However, it’s still a good idea for homeowners to be mindful of the condition of their property and how it may impact their insurance costs. In addition to forgoing some cosmetic repairs, homeowners can also take other steps to lower their insurance premiums. For example, adding safety features such as smoke detectors and security systems can help reduce rates. Raising deductibles and bundling policies can also lead to savings. Ultimately, every homeowner’s situation is unique, and it’s important to work with a trusted insurance agent to determine the best course of action for reducing costs. By being strategic about which repairs they choose to make, homeowners can potentially save money on their insurance premiums without sacrificing safety or livability.","CHICAGO – Sept. 28, 2015 – An influx of storm-chasing contractors may be indirectly pushing up home insurance prices in areas where they operate. These contractors often knock on homeowners' doors and say they need a new roof or siding due to wind and hail damage – all cosmetic damage repairs that may not be necessary. Fixing it may help a home look better, but it won't function better. Home insurance companies often classify dents, dimples and dings in roof vents, shingles or aluminum siding as ""cosmetic damage"" to a property, says Billy Van Jura, an insurance broker in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. ""When several claims for this type of work are submitted in a single region, the price everyone pays (including those who haven't filed a claim) can increase because the insurer sees the region as having greater risk of additional claims,"" an article at realtor.com® cautions. ""There's nothing you can do about a widespread storm that damages several homes in your area and ultimately raises everyone's rates."" However, ""you can help curb your own annual home insurance costs with a little-known option called 'cosmetic damage exclusion."" The American Association of Insurance Services created the cosmetic damage exclusion in 2013. Its goal is to protect consumers from scammers and attempt to keep home insurance rates more affordable by making cosmetic damage coverage optional. Homeowners can then decide if they want to pay for cosmetic-only wind and hail damage. If the damage impacts the safety or structural functionality of the home, the home insurance policy kicks in. By adding this exclusion to cosmetic damage, homeowners stand to save money on their annual premiums – anywhere from $100 to $200 or more, says Troy Thompson, an independent insurance broker with Pinnacle Insurance Agency in Coon Rapids, Minn. Hail and wind damage claims alone contribute to about 40 percent of all home insurance claims in the last five years, according to the Insurance Information Institute. And many of those claims may be for minor cosmetic repairs, such as a few nicks in the siding that homeowners may be told are more urgent than they actually are. Homeowners who remain covered for cosmetic damage may submit a claim, but they may also have to pay applicable deductibles, insurance agents say.

45,"Washington County is set to experience a boost in its economy, thanks to the recent influx of international industries that have chosen to set up shop in the area. This development presents an excellent opportunity for the county to create job opportunities and stimulate economic growth. One of the industries making significant investments in the area is the aerospace industry. With the recent expansion of the local airport and the establishment of a new maintenance facility, Washington County is well-positioned to become a major player in this sector. The county's proximity to the Gulf of Mexico and its excellent transportation links to other parts of the state and the country have also attracted companies in the shipping and logistics industries. These industries have found the county's well-developed infrastructure and skilled workforce to be ideal for their operations, prompting them to invest in the area. Another key attraction for the international industries is the county's pro-business policies and favorable tax conditions. The county has been able to cut through red tape, making it easier for businesses to establish and thrive in the area. Additionally, the friendly business environment has attracted entrepreneurs and startups looking to tap into the opportunities presented by the county's growing economy. In response to the surge in industrial growth, the local government has developed plans to upgrade public infrastructure, such as roads and utilities, in order to support economic growth in the area. This move is aimed at ensuring that the county can meet the infrastructure needs of the growing businesses while providing a high quality of life for residents. The economic benefits of the industrial growth are not limited to Washington County alone. The expansion of these industries has a ripple effect on the entire region, with the creation of jobs and economic opportunities bolstering the local economy. As the county continues to attract more international industries, its position as a key economic center in the state is expected to grow. In summary, Washington County's recent investment in international industries presents a tremendous opportunity for the area's economic development. The influx of investment and growth in the aerospace, logistics and shipping sectors, coupled with the friendly business environment and favorable tax policies provide a strong foundation for economic growth. As the county continues to invest in public infrastructure and support the growth of these industries, the future looks bright for Washington County and the surrounding region.","PRWeb The Washington County Board of County Commissioners is deploying an international economic development project mission to Janghueng County, Korea, as part of a business opportunity slated to bring more than 100 jobs to the region.

46,"Dancing On Ice skater Joseph Tsang has been captured in a Hong Kong honey trap, following accusations of raping a fellow ice skater. Tsang, who competed on the popular UK reality show in 2020, was accused of sexual assault by skater Brianna Lee earlier this year. Lee, who trained alongside Tsang at an ice rink in Hong Kong, claimed that he raped her during a trip to a competition in Japan in 2020. Following Lee's allegations, Tsang fled back to his native Hong Kong, where he continued to skate and compete at a high level. But now, it has emerged that Tsang has been caught in a honey trap operation, after agreeing to meet with an undercover police officer posing as a young girl online. The sting was organised by a local police task force set up to clamp down on online sexual predators, according to Hong Kong news outlet The Standard. Tsang was reportedly lured to a hotel room in a downtown area, where he was ambushed by police and taken into custody. He now faces charges of sexual assault, as well as charges related to the online grooming of minors. Tsang's lawyers have denied all charges against him, and claim that he was set up by Lee and her supporters in a bid to discredit him and ruin his career. They say that Lee had been jealous of Tsang's success on Dancing On Ice, and had fabricated the rape allegations in an attempt to damage his reputation. However, Lee's lawyer has hit back at these claims, saying that they are ""completely baseless and without merit"". ""This is just another attempt by Tsang and his team to try and evade justice,"" he said. ""The truth will come out in court."" The case has sparked outrage in the ice skating community, with many calling for greater protections for athletes from sexual harassment and assault. ""Dancing On Ice needs to take a hard look at how they vet their contestants,"" said one skater, who spoke anonymously to Mail Online UK. ""We can't keep letting people like Tsang slip through the cracks and go on to hurt others."" Tsang's arrest is just the latest in a series of high-profile cases of sexual predators being exposed and brought to justice in Hong Kong. Last year, a group of women led a campaign to name and shame alleged sexual harassers in the city, using the social media hashtag #metooHongKong. The movement led to the arrest of several prominent figures, including a senior university lecturer and a former government official. However, many activists and advocates say that much more needs to be done to protect women and other vulnerable groups from sexual predators and abusers. ""The fight against sexual violence is a long and ongoing battle,"" said one activist, who spoke to Mail Online UK. ""We need to keep pushing for change, and demanding justice for survivors.""","Joseph Tsang, 31, fled UK partway through rape and sex assault trial Claims he dressed as a woman and used sister's passport at Heathrow Schoolfriend who met him in Hong Kong decided to call Mail on Sunday Newspaper helped set up sting which saw Tsang arrested and in court Sting: Tsang is pictured above on a Hong Kong street, before he was ensnared in a sting facilitated by the Mail on Sunday A paedophile rapist who fled Britain on the eve of his trial for horrific sex attacks on underage girls has been arrested in Hong Kong in a dramatic ‘honey trap’ sting set up by The Mail on Sunday. Armed Interpol officers swooped on Joseph Tsang, who has been on the run since mid-August, after he was lured out of hiding with the promise of a date with a teenage girl on Friday night. This newspaper can also exclusively reveal that the 31-year-old claims he skipped Britain by disguising himself as a woman and using his sister’s passport, raising alarming questions about security at Heathrow Airport. He told school friend Alex O’Neill – who lives in Hong Kong – he was ‘terrified’ as he boarded a Hong Kong-bound flight and spent the flight with a hat over his face. Tsang started exchanging Facebook messages with O’Neill and his girlfriend, Stephanie Velenzuela, soon after his escape. They visited him in his hideaway in a high-rise apartment block before deciding to contact The Mail on Sunday for help to turn him in. We put O’Neill in touch with police in the UK and Hong Kong, but there was a tense week-long wait before an extradition order could be processed to enable Tsang’s arrest. Finally, hours after the extradition order was approved in Hong Kong, Tsang was lured out of his hideaway after Stephanie, 22, texted him promising to bring a teenage friend to meet him at a local McDonald’s. As he stepped out of a lift with O’Neill, the armed team pounced, pinning him to the floor and handcuffing him when he tried to swing a punch at one officer to escape. Yesterday, Tsang was in a detention centre awaiting extradition to Britain, where he has been convicted of raping girls aged 14 and 15 and making indecent images of a child. Led away: Tsang wore a black hood as international police escorted him to a holding cell from which UK authorities will order his extradition The IT professional – an accomplished ice skater who in 2009 appeared alongside Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean on ITV’s Dancing On Ice – fled Britain last month just days before his second sex offences trial. He was convicted in his absence of two counts of rape and two counts of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl whom he groomed on Facebook before driving her to a hotel in Portsmouth in December 2011. In an earlier trial in January, Tsang was convicted of one count of making indecent images of children, two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and three counts of sexual activity with a child. Oxford Crown Court heard he lured a 14-year-old girl to his home in Oxford in 2012 to sexually abuse and take photos of her. Escape: Tsang, left, claims he escaped the UK by using a passport belonging to his sister Josephine, right, and disguising himself as a woman Tsang absconded after he was released on bail with the condition he wear an electronic ankle tag and surrender his UK passport. When he fled, Tsang – who has dual nationality – entered Hong Kong using his electronic ID card. He initially planned to ask to serve his jail term in Hong Kong. ‘He was desperate not to serve a jail term in the UK because he said he would be singled out and beaten up as a sex offender there,’ O’Neill said. However, when a lawyer in Hong Kong told him he must serve his term in the UK, Tsang considered fleeing to the nearby Chinese gambling resort of Macau, which has no UK extradition treaty, or slipping into Thailand on a false passport. He eventually decided to stay in hiding in Hong Kong and around ten days ago moved into an unfurnished 28th floor flat in the city’s Ap Lei Chau district. Skater: Tsang is circled above in Dancing On Ice, which he appeared on in 2009 alongside Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean O’Neill – who makes a living selling electronic goods on eBay – said: ‘Joey was a nice guy but when I saw him this time, he wasn’t the guy I used to know. He seemed to have gone a bit crazy. When he spoke about the UK cases, he said he did have sex with the girls but insisted it wasn’t rape.’ Stephanie said: ‘When we went to see him, he was always asking me for girls and looking at the girls on my Facebook page and saying, “Set me up with her”. He was creepy.’ O’Neill stayed in daily contact with police in the UK and Hong Kong as he continued visiting Tsang while an extradition order was drawn up. Tsang, meanwhile, grew increasingly paranoid, using binoculars to watch for police cars and monitoring the internet for news of the manhunt for him. Yesterday, Tsang appeared in a Hong Kong court where he was remanded in custody. A lawyer representing him said he would contest extradition. Tory MP Nicola Blackwood, for Oxford West and Abingdon, said last night: ‘Tsang inflicted a living nightmare on his victims but ran like a coward when he faced justice. I want to thank The Mail on Sunday for their help. It is going to make a big difference to the victims.’ A Home Office spokesman said Tsang’s sister’s passport was clean and therefore did not arouse suspicion at Heathrow because he was not on a flight risk database. She added: ‘Ultimately it is an airline’s responsibility to check a passport matches the person travelling.’ A spokesman for Heathrow Airport said: ‘We do not comment on security matters.’"
47,"In an impressive display of offensive prowess, the No. 4 Baylor Bears dominated the SMU Mustangs 56-21 in their latest outing. Baylor quarterback Charlie Brewer was the star of the show, throwing for 344 yards and four touchdowns while also rushing for another score. Running back John Lovett also had an excellent game, recording 126 yards and two touchdowns on the ground. The Bears' defense was equally impressive, holding the Mustangs to just 324 yards and forcing three turnovers. Baylor's defensive back Grayland Arnold had two interceptions, including one that he returned for a touchdown. This win improves Baylor's record to 3-0 and puts them in a strong position for the upcoming match-ups against Iowa State and Texas Tech. The Bears will hope to continue their explosive offensive performances as they look to contend for a spot in the College Football Playoff. Overall, this win will undoubtedly be remembered as a dominant display of skill and execution by the Bears.","Seth Russell threw for 376 yards and five touchdowns and also ran for a score to help fourth-ranked Baylor open the season with a 56-21 victory at SMU on Friday night.The two-time defending Big 12 champion Bears finally got to start fresh after the long, long offseason that followed their playoff snub last season.SMU played its first game for new coach Chad Morris, Clemson's offensive coordinator the past four seasons.

48,"TALKING TACTICS: Finding the right Plan B In modern football, there is a common saying amongst coaches and fans: ""You can always tell the strength of a team by their Plan B"". Simply put, Plan B refers to the ability to change tactics mid-game when things aren't working out. Despite the importance of having a Plan B, many managers still struggle to find the right formula to turn things around. In this edition of Talking Tactics, we delve into the art of finding the perfect Plan B and why it's critical to success. The first step in finding the perfect Plan B is understanding the game. A team that plays with a high press may not benefit from a defensive approach when things aren't going their way. Instead, they may opt to kill the game by holding the ball better and relying on individual brilliance to create chances. Similarly, a team that loves to sit back and soak up pressure may look to attack when they need a goal. Another essential aspect of Plan B is personnel. Managers must have a deep understanding of their players' strengths and weaknesses to deploy them in positions they can thrive. Deploying the wrong player or making the wrong substitution can prove costly to a team's fortunes. An excellent example of a team mastering Plan B comes from Liverpool's run to the Champions League final in 2018. Jurgen Klopp's men were trailing Roma 3-1 in the second leg of their semifinal tie, and things looked dire. Still, Klopp responded by bringing in Georginio Wijnaldum from the bench, who went on to score twice and tilt the tie in Liverpool's favor. Finally, tactics on their own are not enough to win games. Building the right mentality and having the right hunger is vital when things aren't going your way. A team that gives up when things get tough can never benefit from Plan B. A positive approach to problem-solving can help players dig deep and overcome adversity while still sticking to the tactics at hand. In conclusion, finding the perfect Plan B is no easy feat, but it can be done. When coaches understand the game, utilize their personnel effectively and foster the right mentality, their teams can turn games around and find success. As we look forward to the upcoming football season, it will be fascinating to see which managers have mastered the art of Plan B and which have not.","A BIG criticism of Mark Cooper’s play-off final-losing side last season was they only had one way to win a game. The manager often explained this was because of the players he had and using a system that best suited their abilities. To some extent this season, he has either demonstrated a willingness to work with multiple systems or he feels he has more tactically astute players. Given the relative experience of the players he has now and the ones departed, you would surmise it is probably the latter. Cooper admitted on Saturday that a difference in formation is often as little as a five-yard tweak, but in the context of the win at Crewe, it was important. In the first half, Town started with a 4-2-3-1. James Brophy, making his second senior start, was pushed forward into the advanced left-wing position and Nicky Ajose was given the task on the right. It was not very successful. Brophy struggled to get forward as he too often had to help out Brandon Ormonde-Ottewill, who was having a poor game against Ryan Colclough. Eventually, Brophy was moved into defence. With just two central midfielders to link play between attack and defence, Swindon actually struggled to dominate the ball. At half-time, the Town boss accepted he would not be able to control the midfield with the players he had available and instead opted to utilise his forwards' ability on the break. Ormonde-Ottewill’s injury was a blessing in disguise. Brophy dealt much better with Colclough and Cooper used the opportunity to switch to a 4-4-2 diamond, with youngster Tom Smith coming on to provide more energy in midfield. Share article Though Town ceded control of midfield and spent more time defending, they looked a more potent attacking force with Nicky Ajose and Wes Thomas paired together up front. Chances came when they stretched Crewe’s defence with balls in behind, but it was also the ability of the two strikers to harry their opponents and win the ball high up the pitch that created chances."

50,"As September rolls around, many people are feeling the urge to get back on track after a summer of indulgences. Whether it's the return to a routine or the desire to shed some pounds before the holiday season, there's no denying that September is a popular time to shape up. At Weight Watchers, we believe that the key to success is making sustainable lifestyle changes that stick. That's why we've put together some tips to help you get back on track this September and beyond. First and foremost, it's important to set realistic goals. If you've been inactive all summer, don't expect to be running a marathon by October. Instead, aim for small, achievable goals, like going for a walk three times a week or packing a healthy lunch every day. Gradually building up your fitness and healthy habits will help you avoid burnout and keep your momentum going. In addition to setting realistic goals, it's crucial to have a plan. Meal planning, in particular, is a powerful tool for weight loss and healthy eating. Taking some time each week to plan out your meals and snacks can help you stay on track, avoid last-minute unhealthy choices, and save you time and money in the long run. And don't worry, you don't have to be a gourmet chef to create delicious and healthy meals! Our Weight Watchers app and website are full of easy, healthy recipes that anyone can make. Another helpful tip is to find a support system. Whether it's a friend, family member, or weight loss community like Weight Watchers, having people in your corner can make all the difference. Not only can they help keep you accountable, but they can also provide encouragement and support when you're feeling discouraged or overwhelmed. Finally, be kind to yourself. Nobody is perfect, and setbacks are a natural part of any weight loss journey. If you slip up and eat an entire pizza or skip a workout, don't beat yourself up. Instead, acknowledge what happened, learn from it, and move on. Remember, the most important thing is to keep going, even when it's tough. In conclusion, September is a great time to hit the reset button and start fresh with your health and wellness goals. By setting realistic goals, making a plan, finding a support system, and being kind to yourself, you can make sustainable changes that will lead to a healthier, happier you. At Weight Watchers, we're here to support you every step of the way. Here's to a happy and healthy September!","I had my annual doctor's visit today. All is well and my OB/GYN was thrilled to hear that I'm on WW and attending meetings. She said something that really struck me. She said, ""We are all a work in progress, my dear."" So true. So that got me to thinking about September and the progress I want to see when the month comes to a close. In the past, that would have been easy. I would have picked some arbitrary ""lost this amount of weight"" number and set that as my goal. This time I around, I've learned. I need to find success and joy in more than the scale. I need to find it in new habits and my commitment to a way of life. That said, here are my commitments for September: 1) Stop stressing myself out on weigh-in days! I go to a Tuesday evening meeting after work. For weeks, I've struggled with trying to figure out how much I can eat and drink throughout the day so that it doesn't throw my weigh-in off. Do any of you struggle with this? This month, I'm going to focus on consistent days, not numbers on the scale. No more Tuesday stress. 2) Enjoy the transition to fall by getting outside to exercise! I love fall. The sights, the smells, the activities, the return to comfy sweaters and other comfy clothes. I'm going to take in every moment and try to incorporate at least one outdoor workout into my weekly routine. Last night, my daughter and I walked three miles. It was her first day back to school and I spent the entire 45 minutes talking with her about her day, her friends, her life. It was priceless and I am definitely going to do it again soon! 3) Finding joy in NSVs! I'm a big scale watcher. I weigh myself twice a day and I've always used that number as my ""go to"" measure of success. This month, I'm going to focus on other things. Did I track all week (and I mean EVERY bite)? Do these pants fit better? Can I walk further/stay on the elliptical longer without feeling so tired? The scale will drop if I keep working hard. It won't be on my timeline maybe, but that's okay as long as I'm seeing progress. So, here's to September and making it a great time to shape up and slim down!"

52,"Spennymoor Town must be careful as they face Clitheroe who come into the game full of confidence, according to their manager Jason Ainsley. The two sides are set to meet in the upcoming FA Cup match, and Ainsley believes that his team must be wary of their opponents who have been in great form lately. “Clitheroe are playing with a lot of confidence at the moment, so we know that we are in for a tough game,” said Ainsley. “They have been doing very well in their recent matches, and we cannot underestimate them.” Spennymoor Town, however, are not to be underestimated either, as they have had a strong start to the season winning five out of their six games so far. “We have had a good start to the season ourselves, and we are going to go into this match with confidence,” said Ainsley. “We know that we have the quality to win, and we will be looking to get the job done.” The FA Cup match between Spennymoor Town and Clitheroe will take place on September 18th, and is set to be a closely contested affair, with both teams looking to advance to the next round of the competition.","Jason Ainsley says Spennymoor Town must be wary of a Clitheroe side “full of confidence” as they seek to keep pace at the top of Evo-Stik North. The Moors are sixth in the table, with two wins and two draws. Yet they face a Clitheroe side at the Brewery Field today one place and a point above them. Ainsley said: “Clitheroe are coming here full of confidence after their good start to the season. “They have already won away from home once this season at Droylsden, which is no mean feat. We have to make sure we win and not drop out of the promotion pack.” Spenny will be without Glen Taylor (toe), Danny Frost (foot) and Michael Hogganson (appendicitis). Priestley Keithley has joined on non-contract terms from Middlesbrough and, though frustrated by injuries in his forward ranks, Ainsley is delighted by the form of strikers Liam Henderson and Nathan Fisher. He added: “We have not had much continuity because of the injuries. “Frosty has only played 18 minutes of the first game and Glen injured his toe at home but their (Henderson and Fisher’s) workrate and commitment have been excellent and they will probably start against Clitheroe.”"

55,"Clive Palmer's ex-friend is taking legal action after claiming he is owed over $250,000 by the billionaire businessman. Nikolic has alleged that Palmer promised him the cash in return for helping to secure his nickel refinery's access to port facilities in Western Australia. Nikolic says he fulfilled his part of the deal but was never paid. Palmer's lawyers deny that any such agreement was ever made and say that the funds sought by Nikolic were a loan that has since been repaid in full. The case is set to be heard in the Queensland Supreme Court next month. This isn't the first time Palmer has been embroiled in legal disputes. Just last year, a court ruled that Mr. Palmer must pay $1.5 million to Universal Music after losing a court battle over the use of a song in a political advertisement.","Clive Palmer's former friend says he believed the mining billionaire would deliver on a promised $5 million job offer even though the sum wasn't in his contract. Bill Schoch is suing Mr Palmer and two Palmer companies for $4.6 million, claiming he was tricked into signing a ""sham"" contract that cut his $5 million salary over five years to a substantially smaller figure. Mr Schoch told the Brisbane Supreme Court on Monday that in June 2011 Mr Palmer personally offered him $1 million per year for five years to work for him, but later his contract stated just $100,000 per year. Next to the figure Mr Schoch added ""plus bonus as agreed"", which made Mr Palmer's human resources staff laugh. ""I didn't care whether they laughed or not because it was a deal that I had with Clive, who I'd known for 40 years, and that was it,"" Mr Schoch told the first day of a civil trial."
56,"Honda's popular Pilot SUV has been redesigned for the 2021 model year, with sleeker styling and increased interior space. The new Pilot looks smaller than the previous model, but Honda has managed to increase the size of the cabin while also adding more features. The exterior of the 2021 Honda Pilot features a more aerodynamic shape with a redesigned front grille and headlights. The Pilot's beltline has been lowered, giving it a sportier look. The rear of the vehicle has also been updated, with new taillights and a redesigned bumper. Under the hood, the 2021 Pilot features a 3.5-liter V6 engine that produces 280 horsepower and 262 pound-feet of torque. The engine is paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission, which provides smooth shifts and good fuel efficiency. Inside, the Pilot has a spacious and well-appointed cabin. The new model features a redesigned dashboard, which is more modern and functional than the previous model. The infotainment system has been updated with a new 8-inch touch screen that features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. The Pilot's third-row seats are easily accessible, thanks to Honda's One-Touch second-row seats. The third-row seats can comfortably accommodate adults, and the second-row seats offer ample legroom for passengers of all sizes. The Pilot's cargo area is also spacious, offering 18.5 cubic feet of space behind the third row and up to 83.9 cubic feet with the second and third rows folded down. Honda has also added several new features to the Pilot for the 2021 model year. The new model now comes standard with Honda Sensing, an advanced suite of driver-assist technologies that includes adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, and collision mitigation braking. The Pilot also features a new Rear Seat Reminder system, which reminds drivers to check the back seat before leaving the vehicle. The 2021 Honda Pilot is available in four trim levels: LX, EX, EX-L, and Touring. The LX offers a good value with standard features like LED headlights, a 5-inch infotainment screen, and a rearview camera. The EX adds more features like the new 8-inch touch screen, tri-zone automatic climate control, and blind-spot monitoring. The EX-L adds leather upholstery, a power-operated tailgate, and a sunroof. The top-of-the-line Touring adds luxury features like a heated steering wheel, a 10-speaker premium sound system, and a rear-seat entertainment system with a DVD player. Overall, the 2021 Honda Pilot is an excellent choice for families looking for a spacious SUV with a comfortable ride. The new model's sleeker styling and increased interior space make it more attractive than ever, while its advanced safety features and modern infotainment system make it a great value.","Home > Article VOL. 39 | NO. 37 | Friday, September 11, 2015 By Ann M. Job | For the Associated Press Updated 12:52PM Don’t let the Pilot’s new, sleek look fool you. Honda’s largest sport utility vehicle is bigger than ever on the inside, particularly in its third-row seats. Revamped from roof to tires, the 2016 Pilot shed its boxy exterior and upgraded its interior while adding features and power and is now capable of generating 280 horsepower from its re-engineered and noticeably refined V-6 engine. It also shed weight, putting this more powerful Pilot at the top in fuel mileage among large three-row gasoline-powered 2016 SUVs. The front-wheel drive 2016 Pilot with a new nine-speed automatic transmission is rated by the federal government at 20 mpg in city driving and 27 mpg on the highway. There’s even a new top-of-the-line Pilot Elite that comes standard with 20-inch wheels, leather seats and spacious second-row captain’s chairs, as well as the latest safety equipment and luxury-car features like a heated steering wheel. The starting manufacturer’s suggested retail price, including destination charge, for the 2016 Pilot is $30,875 for a base LX model with front-wheel drive. The lowest starting retail price, including destination charge, for an all-wheel drive Pilot LX is $32,675. The new Elite model, which has standard all-wheel drive, is priced at $47,300. The Pilot’s 3.5-liter V-6 engine adds direct injection to help boost horsepower by 30 over last year’s model. Torque is increased by 9, to 262 foot-pounds at 4,700 rpm, and the test-driven model zoomed forward and merged into traffic with surprising ease. 2016 Honda Pilot AWD Elite BASE PRICE: $29,995 for FWD LX; $31,795 for AWD LX; $32,430 for FWD EX; $34,230 for AWD EX; $35,905 for FWD EX-L; $37,705 for AWD EX-L; $41,020 for FWD Touring; $42,820 for AWD Touring; $46,420 for AWD Elite. PRICE AS TESTED: $42,225. TYPE: Front-engine, all-wheel drive, seven-passenger, large sport utility vehicle. ENGINE: 3.5-liter, single overhead cam, direct injection V-6 with i-VTEC and variable cylinder management. MILEAGE: 19 mpg (city), 26 mpg (highway). TOP SPEED: NA. LENGTH: 194.5 inches. WHEELBASE: 111 inches. CURB WEIGHT: 4,317 pounds. BUILT AT: Lincoln, Ala. OPTIONS: None. DESTINATION CHARGE: $880. The Associated Press With the nine-speed transmission, which is only available on the Touring and Elite models and was in the test-driven Pilot Elite, the engine is surprisingly quiet and vibration-free. Lower trim levels get the carryover six-speed automatic, which reduces fuel mileage numbers by 1 mpg. It’s easy for a driver to forget just how large the new Pilot is because at more than 16 feet long, it feels remarkably light. The lighter weight - now starting at just over 4,000 pounds - and stiffer structure make the 2016 Pilot feel solid and stable but not ponderous. The test-driven model was quiet inside and its supple leather seats and steering wheel wrap, soft-touch interior plastics, side-door sunscreens and 8-inch touchscreen display added to its luxurious feel. The big screen crisply displayed the view from the Pilot’s backup camera. The Elite also comes standard with a panoramic roof and four USB ports, and passengers marveled that so many luxury features could come with a Honda SUV. The ride was comfortable, with the large SUV maintaining a smooth ride as it drove over bumps in the road. And its large, 20-inch wheels didn’t transmit any heaviness to those inside. A new one-touch feature helps passengers get into the third-row seat. Just push a button and a second-row seat automatically tilts and slides to its forward-most position. The second-row seat then can return to its midpoint setting. The Pilot’s third row is easier to access because the step-in is 1.2 inches lower and 2.5 inches wider than before. The third row also has a new, three-position recline feature, and the 38.9 inches of headroom back there is more than what’s in the back seat of a Toyota Camry. The Pilot’s 31.9 inches of third-row legroom can accommodate adults and surpasses what’s in the Kia Sorento and Toyota Highlander third rows. The 2016 Pilot can tow up to 5,000 pounds. Every model comes with six airbags, antilock brakes, brake-assist and electronic stability control. Top trim levels of Touring and Elite add the latest forward collision and lane departure warning and collision mitigation system, among other things. In July, 1,358 new Pilots were recalled because third-row seatbelts might be trapped between the seat and sideliner, making them difficult to use."
57,"The US dollar has weakened against other major currencies in a tentative trade, ahead of the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates today. The greenback fell by 0.2% against the euro, pound sterling, and the Japanese yen in early trading. Investors are cautious ahead of the Fed's announcement, with many expecting the central bank to keep interest rates unchanged for the rest of the year. The dollar has struggled in recent months against a backdrop of slowing global growth, trade tensions between the US and China, and a dovish shift from several major central banks. Analysts say that the outcome of the Fed meeting could further shape the direction of the greenback. ""The outcome of this meeting will be crucial in determining the dollar's direction in the short to medium term,"" said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM. ""If the Fed signals a pause to further rate hikes or a possible cut in the near future, then the dollar may come under renewed selling pressure."" Meanwhile, the British pound has been supported by hopes of a Brexit breakthrough, despite the uncertainty surrounding next week's parliamentary vote. Sterling rose by 0.1% against the dollar, with analysts speculating that a delay to the March 29 Brexit deadline is becoming increasingly likely. ""The market is pricing in a high chance of either an extension or no Brexit at all,"" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com. ""The pound looks like it may be pricing in a greater chance of avoiding a no-deal Brexit."" The euro has also risen against the dollar, boosted by better-than-expected economic data from Germany. The eurozone's largest economy grew by 0.9% in 2018, beating forecasts of 0.6%. However, concerns remain over the potential impact of a global slowdown on the eurozone, as well as political instability in some member states. Overall, analysts expect the dollar to remain under pressure in the near term, as investors await clarity on both monetary policy and geopolitics. ""The dollar's near-term performance is expected to be influenced by the Brexit vote, the ongoing US-China trade negotiations, and the wider geopolitical climate,"" said Sayed. ""Taken together, there are a lot of variables at play that could shape the dollar's trajectory in the coming months.”","Dollars. image source eni The dollar was broadly weaker in cautious Tokyo trade Wednesday, ahead of a US interest rate decision this week that could see the first hike in almost a decade. The greenback fell to 120.30 yen from 120.40 yen Tuesday in New York, and the euro rose to $1.1278 from $1.1272, while several battered emerging market currencies also gained. The single currency fell to 135.67 yen from 135.71 yen. Economists are split over whether the US central bank, at the end of a two-day meeting Thursday, will raise rates for the first time since 2006. Financial markets are pricing the likelihood of a hike at around 32 percent, Bloomberg News said, a sharp drop from before Beijing devalued the yuan in August when the majority of dealers expected a September move. While the Fed has signalled it will raise rates this year, the odds on a rise this month have dropped as concerns have mounted about slowing growth in China and its impact on the world economy. Takuji Okubo, chief economist of Japan Macro Advisors, told AFP that if the market reaction to a rate hike is limited that would suggest the global economy is in better shape than expected. “It’s not that a Fed hike itself is actually positive, but it (would mean) that the global economy isn’t as vulnerable as people feared,” Okubo said. “That could actually reduce uncertainty in the global economy. And the BoJ may like it because the yen may decline without their intervention (such as further stimulus),” he added. Asia-Pacific currencies, including the Singapore dollar and the Malaysian ringgit, which have been battered by concerns over China and the strengthening of the dollar in recent months, also rose on Wednesday. Higher rates would tend to strengthen the greenback, and could severely hurt emerging markets as investors draw their cash out and turn to the US looking for better, safer returns. The South Korea won rallied a day after the Standard & Poor’s ratings agency raised the country’s credit rating. The dollar fell to 1,176.03 won from 1,186.32 won Tuesday in Tokyo. The greenback also fell to Sg$1,3997 from Sg$1.4035, to 4.2513 Malaysian ringgit from 4.3053 ringgit, to 46.67 Philippine pesos from 46.77 pesos, and to Tw$32.50 from Tw$32.57. However, it rose to 66.4375 Indian rupees from 66.4373 rupees, and to 36.00 Thai baht from 35.98 baht. The Australian dollar bought 71.61 US cents Wednesday in Tokyo, up from 71.22 on Tuesday and well up from the six-year lows below 69 cents touched last week. The Chinese yuan fetched 18.88 yen against 18.18 yen. The post appeared first on The Guardian Nigeria ."
58,"As tensions continue to mount in Hong Kong, questions are being raised about the role of the city's chief executive and their authority over the executive, judicial, and legislative branches. Some have argued that the chief executive is above the law and can act with impunity, while others contend that the chief executive is subject to the same checks and balances as any other government official. According to the Basic Law, the chief executive of Hong Kong is not above the executive, judicial, and legislative powers. The Basic Law, which serves as the city's constitution, articulates the principles of ""One Country, Two Systems"" and promises a high degree of autonomy for the former British colony. Despite this autonomy, however, the chief executive is bound by the same rules and regulations as other government officials, and their authority is limited by the Basic Law and the city's judiciary. One area of concern has been the power of the chief executive to appoint judges and other officials in the judiciary. Some have suggested that this power gives the chief executive undue influence over the justice system, allowing them to favor certain judges or exert pressure on the courts to rule in their favor. However, the Basic Law makes it clear that the judiciary is independent and that judges must be impartial and free from political influence. The chief executive's power to appoint judges is also limited by a committee of legal professionals, who are responsible for vetting candidates and ensuring that they meet the necessary qualifications. The Basic Law also outlines the authority of the Legislative Council (LegCo), the city's legislative branch. While the chief executive has the power to introduce legislation and veto bills, their authority is again limited by the Basic Law and by the LegCo itself. The LegCo has the power to override a veto by a two-thirds majority, and lawmakers are elected by the people of Hong Kong, rather than appointed by the chief executive. This means that the chief executive cannot simply impose their will on the legislature, but must work within the democratic system to pass laws and promote their agenda. Another area of concern has been the chief executive's authority over the executive branch, including the police and other government agencies. Some have suggested that the chief executive has too much power to direct these agencies and that they can act with impunity in enforcing the law. However, the Basic Law makes it clear that the executive branch, like the judiciary and legislature, must operate within the confines of the law and must respect the human rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong. The police, for example, must follow proper procedures for arrests and investigations, and must not use excessive force or engage in arbitrary detention. Despite these legal protections, there have been concerns about the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy in recent years. Some critics have accused the central government in Beijing of exerting undue influence over the city's affairs and undermining the democratic principles promised under the Basic Law. The recent protests in Hong Kong, which have seen millions of people take to the streets to demand greater democracy and autonomy, have only heightened these concerns. In response to these concerns, the chief executive and other officials have emphasized the importance of upholding the Basic Law and respecting the autonomy of Hong Kong. They have also emphasized the need for dialogue and cooperation between the government and the people of Hong Kong, in order to address the concerns and grievances that have fueled the protests. Ultimately, the role of the chief executive in Hong Kong is limited by the Basic Law and the principles of democracy and autonomy that it represents. While there may be concerns about the concentration of power in the hands of the chief executive or the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy, the Basic Law provides a clear framework for balancing the power of the government with the rights and freedoms of the people. As the protests continue and tensions remain high, it will be up to the leaders and citizens of Hong Kong to work together to ensure that this framework is respected and upheld.","In April 1987, when China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping met the Basic Law Drafting Committee members in Beijing, he criticised the suggestion to introduce the principle of separation of powers to the would-be Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. He said Hong Kong could not copy directly from the West. The then undemocratic system in Hong Kong was based on the British system, and had been in practice for a century and a half. Deng said it would not be appropriate to introduce to such a system the separation of powers or a British or American parliamentary system, just so it could be seen as a democracy. After Deng's comments, the drafting committee ceased using the term ""separation of powers"". It thus came as no surprise that in Zhang Xiaoming's recent speech on "" A Correct Understanding of the Characteristics of the Political System of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region "", the director of the central government's liaison office in Hong Kong ruled out the existence of separation of powers in Hong Kong and said that separation of powers can be built only on the basis of a political entity in possession of complete state sovereign power. While Zhang may be correct from a strictly legal point of view, in reality, the political system in Hong Kong has evolved since the colonial era to put in place by convention - in practice and in spirit - the principle of separation of powers. The three branches of government each have their own role and function, creating checks and balances between the executive and the legislature, while upholding judicial independence. Whatever term one may use to describe it, it is separation of powers in a real sense. Zhang described the chief executive as having a ""dual head"" status, that is, he is head of the Hong Kong government and at the same time head of the SAR. Zhang also said that the chief executive has ""dual accountability"", that is, he or she is accountable to the central government and also to the Hong Kong government. Both these ""dual"" characteristics, according to Zhang, mean that the chief executive has a special legal status that transcends the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. READ MORE: Leung Chun-ying questions Hong Kong's 'separation of powers' model after controversial remarks by Beijing official In an article published in October 2013, Hao Tiechuan, director of publicity, cultural and public affairs of the central government's liaison office here, recounted that in July 1987, while drafting of the Basic Law was in progress, the British sent to the Chinese a summary on the transition issues relating to the executive and the legislature. Hao said the British team agreed that the Hong Kong government should be led by a strong executive, but there should be appropriate checks and balances between the executive and the legislature, and the two sides should maintain a cooperative relationship. Hao also said that the British stated that the power to accept or reject laws passed by the Legislative Council and the power to dissolve Legco is important to the status of the chief executive under the constitution. During the colonial era, the governor, as the representative of the British monarch, held the power to approve or reject laws passed by legislature and the power to dissolve it, and thus had a status that truly transcended the executive and the legislature. By comparison, the chief executive has a much less ""transcendent"" status than the colonial governor. Whether the chief executive 'transcends' all else or not, Zhang's remarks alone do not mean the chief executive's position has been lifted to that of an emperor First, by the Hong Kong Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions, the governor was the representative of the British monarch, accountable only to the king or queen. Under Article 43 of the Basic Law, the chief executive is accountable to both the central government and the SAR government. Second, the governor was free to reject laws passed by Legco and was free to dissolve the legislature. Under Article 50 of the Basic Law, the chief executive has only very limited power in this regard. Third, there was no mechanism for the impeachment of the governor. Yet, the SAR legislature can initiate proceedings to impeach the chief executive in accordance with Article 73 of the Basic Law. Fourth, during the colonial era, the council did not have the power to force the governor to resign. Under Article 52 of Basic Law, the chief executive must resign under certain specified circumstances. READ MORE: Hong Kong's judicial independence is here to stay - as long as 'one country' and 'two systems' are both fully recognised The chief executive's inherited status and power of the governor have been curtailed by the Basic Law. Whether the chief executive ""transcends"" all else or not, Zhang's remarks alone do not mean the chief executive's position has been lifted to that of an emperor, as suggested by Civic Party legislator Alan Leong Kah-kit. Not only does he not have an imperial sword, as former education chief Michael Suen Ming-yeung stated, but, rather, recent events - including the High Court ruling against the Chief Executive in Council's decision to refuse to issue a TV licence - clearly show that the SAR's vibrant and independent judiciary is the sword of Damocles hanging over the head of the ""transcendent"" chief executive.

59,"Emmerdale fans bid farewell to Alicia Metcalfe - played by Natalie Anderson - last night in an emotional episode that saw her leave the village she had called home for years. The storyline had been building for several months and had left many fans wondering how and why Alicia would leave the soap. In an exclusive interview with Radio Times, Natalie Anderson has revealed more about her exit and what the future holds for her. Anderson spoke candidly about her decision to leave the show after five years, saying: “It was a really hard decision to make, and I didn't take it lightly. But I felt like I had come to a natural end with the character. I’m incredibly proud of what we achieved with Alicia and the relationships she built in the village. But ultimately, I felt like it was time to move on and explore other opportunities.” Fans of the soap will undoubtedly miss Alicia's spunky personality and her dynamic relationships with the other characters on the show. But Anderson believes that Alicia’s exit was necessary for the character. “Alicia has been through so much over the years - she’s lost her husband, been through a difficult divorce, and struggled with her son’s behavior. It’s time for her to move on and start fresh somewhere else,” she said. Anderson also spoke of the challenges of playing such a complex and beloved character. “Alicia has been one of the most rewarding roles I’ve ever played, but also one of the most challenging. She’s a very layered character, with a lot of deep emotions and pain. It takes a lot of energy to dig into those emotions for each scene, day in and day out. But I'm proud of what we achieved together.” So what's next for Natalie Anderson? Although nothing is set in stone, the actress said she is excited to explore new opportunities and pursue other projects. “I’m looking forward to finding new challenges and being able to show people what else I can do. Emmerdale has been an amazing experience, but I’m ready to move onto the next chapter in my career.” For fans of the show who are sad to see Alicia go, Anderson offered one final message: “Thank you for your support and for loving Alicia as much as I did. It's been an honor to play her, and I’ll never forget the memories and experiences I've had on Emmerdale. I hope you’ll all continue to watch, support the show and the amazing cast and crew who make it all possible.” While it’s hard to say goodbye to such a beloved character, fans can take solace in knowing that Natalie Anderson is leaving the show on a high note, and will be remembered for her outstanding performance as Alicia Metcalfe. Emmerdale won’t be the same without her, but the show must go on.","""It will always be somewhere that reminds her of what Lachlan did,"" says the actress A torn Alicia Metcalfe is to decide that her future lies in Portugal - and away from husband David, who opts to stay in Emmerdale. Alicia, whose memories of the village are tainted by her assault earlier this year at the hands of Lachlan White, will depart in emotional scenes to be shown next week. ""There's a moment where Alicia says that she feels like a failure because she was once happy in Emmerdale and she's now let Lachlan beat her,"" says actress Natalie Anderson. ""She's disappointed in herself for not being stronger and I'm sad for her too. It was a place she loved very much, but at the moment it will always be somewhere that reminds her of what Lachlan did. But, down the line, who knows what might happen?"" So is there not even a small part of her that wants to stay? ""No, absolutely not. She misses her sister, but not everything else. They're also dealing with Val's death, which is bleak and upsetting, especially for Jacob. So it's become a dark place for her, whereas Portugal is lovely and sunny. Over there, she felt like she had a future again."" David has, of course, been preoccupied with looking out for his grieving dad Eric's welfare. But viewers - and Alicia - know that he would in fact do anything to stay in the village and not return overseas. And, in the end, it's only when David's mask slips that the whole truth comes out. ""Alicia loves David deeply, but she's becoming frustrated with him because she wants him to have the courage to say that he never wanted to go to Portugal and doesn't want to go back,"" continues Anderson. ""She feels like he's using his dad as an excuse. She would have more respect for him if he just came out and said it. Then when he does, that stresses her out a lot."" As for Anderson, the storyline marks the end of her five years on the ITV soap. ""The fans have been so kind,"" she says. ""I've had lots of messages saying that they can't believe I'm leaving. Prior to the helicopter crash, there was a lot of speculation that Alicia would die. I've been overwhelmed by the support that the fans have shown both me and my on-screen family."" And who is she going to miss the most? ""Everyone! Obviously my girls - Roxy Shahidi, Fiona Wade and Gaynor Faye. I'll miss them deeply. But obviously my family as well. I'll miss them all.""

63,"As the Federal Reserve continues to gradually increase interest rates, businesses are paying closer attention to the potential impact on their operations. Here are three ways rising rates can affect companies: 1. Increased borrowing costs: With higher interest rates, businesses that rely on borrowing to fund operations or expansion may need to pay more in interest, which can eat into profits. 2. Decreased consumer spending: Higher rates can lead to higher costs for consumer borrowing, potentially reducing discretionary spending and hurting businesses that rely on consumer spending. 3. Changes in investment activity: Rising rates can impact investment strategies, leading some businesses to adjust their priorities or even delay projects.","Interest rates, both short- and long-term, have been at record lows for many years, with the federal funds rate hovering close to zero for more than five years. While the Fed plays a role in setting the benchmark for short-term interest rates, its policies also determine inflation expectations over the long-term. After keeping rates low to help the economy recover, the Fed has indicated it may be ready to start raising rates, perhaps as early as this fall. With rates so low, it will take a long…"

65,"Parenthood can be challenging, and every parent is always searching for ways to make their job easier. Parenting hacks come in handy when you need to be a bit more efficient, consistent, or just keep your own sanity. In this article, we have compiled nine excellent parenting hacks to help make your life less stressful and more enjoyable. Read on to discover these hacks and transform your parenting game. 1. Use toothpaste to clean crayon marks on walls It's common for our little ones to get creative and draw on walls with crayons. Instead of stressing about repainting the wall, use toothpaste to get the crayon marks off. Simply squeeze a small amount of toothpaste onto a damp cloth, scrub the crayon marks, and then wipe the wall clean with a dry cloth. Voila! The wall is as good as new. 2. Use a muffin tin for separating small toys If you're tired of stepping on tiny toys scattered all over the house, a muffin tin can do the job. Separate the small toys in the muffin cups and place them in a drawer or on a shelf. This not only keeps the toys organized but also reduces the chance of the little toys being lost or swallowed by a curious toddler. 3. Put on a puppet show during haircuts Haircuts can be scary for kids, especially when they are still young. To make the experience more fun and less daunting, put on a puppet show during the haircut. Place a hand puppet on your hand and make it ""talk"" to your child while you're trimming their hair. This can help to distract them and reduce their anxiety. 4. Play ""Simon says"" to get children to do chores Getting children to do chores can be a struggle, but the game ""Simon Says"" can help make it more interesting. Have your child play ""Simon says"" while doing tasks such as picking up their toys or putting their dishes in the sink. This turns chores into a fun activity and makes it easier to get things done. 5. Freeze juice boxes overnight for a cool school treat On warm school days, frozen juice boxes make for an excellent treat. Simply place the juice box in the freezer overnight, and pack it in your child's lunch the following day. The drink will remain cold, and your child can enjoy a refreshing treat during lunch. 6. Use a shower organizer to store bath toys Bath toys can occupy lots of space in the bathroom and create clutter. To keep them organized, use a shower organizer with pockets that can be hung on the shower rod. This way, the toys stay dry and in one place, and you don't have to worry about stepping on them when taking a shower. 7. Assign colors to children's toothbrushes Assigning a specific color to each child's toothbrush can help to prevent mix-ups and reduce the spread of germs. This hack also makes it easier for parents to keep track of who brushed their teeth and who didn't. 8. Leave a note in your child's lunchbox Leaving a note in your child's lunchbox shows them that you're thinking about them, even when you're not together. Write a short message to let them know that you love them, wish them good luck on a test, or have a great day. This simple gesture can make a huge difference in their day. 9. Use pool noodles to protect little fingers Pool noodles are a great way of keeping little fingers safe from harm. Cut a pool noodle lengthwise and wrap it around a door to prevent little fingers from getting pinched. This hack is perfect for homes with young children who are still discovering their surroundings. Parenting can be a tough job, but with these excellent parenting hacks, you can breeze through the day with less stress and more fun.

66,"Moody's Investors Service has confirmed the long-term deposit rating of Baa1 for China Merchants Bank, popularly known as CM Bank, according to an announcement made on Thursday. The confirmation of the rating, which denotes moderate credit risk, reflects the bank's strong asset quality, capitalization and profitability, but is tempered by the potential for asset risks given its rapid loan growth, Moody's said in a statement. As one of the most successful commercial banks in China, CM Bank has experienced rapid loan growth in recent years, primarily driven by its corporate banking activities. Although this growth has helped maintain its strong profitability, Moody's has cautioned that it may lead to increased credit and asset risks. However, the stable outlook on the bank's rating reflects Moody's expectation that CM Bank will be able to maintain its solid performance amidst China's ongoing economic challenges, while continuing to improve its risk management and capital levels. ""The bank's capitalization, asset quality and profitability are among the strongest in China's banking system, and it is one of the few banks in China that is well positioned to handle a severe stress scenario,"" said Nicholas Zhu, Vice President and Senior Credit Officer at Moody's. Moody's also noted that CM Bank's ""diversified loan book and strong franchise"" have enabled it to maintain a stable funding profile, which is a key credit strength. This announcement from Moody's comes at a time when several other Chinese banks are facing increasing credit and asset risks as a result of the country's economic slowdown and rising corporate defaults. In response to Moody's confirmation of its rating, CM Bank issued a statement reaffirming its commitment to maintaining its strong profitability and risk management measures, while continuing to innovate and expand its business. ""We will continue to implement a prudent and proactive approach to risk management, while pursuing sustainable growth and serving our clients with high-quality financial products and services,"" the bank said in the statement. Overall, Moody's confirmation of CM Bank's long-term deposit rating as Baa1 provides a strong vote of confidence for the bank's stability and creditworthiness, despite the ongoing challenges facing China's banking sector.","AASTOCKS.com Ltd, HKEx Information Services Limited, China Investment Information Services Limited, its holding companies and/or any subsidiaries of such holding companies endeavour to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the Information provided but do not guarantee its accuracy or reliability and accept no liability (whether in tort or contract or otherwise) for any loss or damage arising from any inaccuracies or omissions.

67,"For singer-songwriter Ryan Adams, the experience of covering Taylor Swift's ""1989"" album was ""incredibly humbling."" In a recent interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Adams spoke about the process of taking on the pop star's record, which was initially released in 2014. ""It was such an honor,"" said Adams. ""Taylor has become, over the years, one of the biggest voices in modern pop music, and to be able to reinterpret her songs in my own way was something that really challenged me as an artist."" Adams' version of ""1989"" was released in September 2015, and it was met with widespread critical acclaim. The album features stripped-down, acoustic interpretations of all 13 tracks, including hit singles like ""Shake it Off,"" ""Blank Space,"" and ""Bad Blood."" For Adams, the process of re-imagining each song was a deeply personal one. He spent months experimenting with different sounds and arrangements, eventually settling on a more subdued, introspective tone. ""I really wanted to bring out the emotional core of each song,"" said Adams. ""I wanted to focus on the lyrics and the melodies and really let them shine through."" Adams' version of ""1989"" was especially well-received by Swift's legions of fans, who praised the album for its stripped-back, intimate feel. The two artists even struck up a friendship in the wake of the release, with Swift publicly thanking Adams for his interpretation of her work. Looking back on the experience, Adams says that covering ""1989"" was one of the most rewarding projects of his career. ""For me, it was all about paying homage to Taylor's incredible songwriting,"" said Adams. ""To be able to take those songs and make them my own was a challenge, but it was also incredibly humbling. I hope that people will continue to enjoy our version of '1989' for years to come.""","Rocker Ryan Adams said covering Taylor Swift's entire ""1989"" album was ""incredibly humbling"" and helped him explore himself more deeply as a musician. Adams' version of ""1989"" was digitally released Monday. Swift released the original album — her first full-blown pop record — last October. ""It's actually incredibly humbling to find a connection with someone else's words and someone else's songs and to open yourself up and to feel them fully, and find out where those stories take you,"" Adams, 40, said in an interview last week. ""It felt no less genuine than any song I've ever written for myself."" So far, Swift's fifth album has sold 5.2 million units and launched multiple hits, including No.1s like ""Shake It Off,"" ""Blank Space"" and ""Bad Blood."" Adams' interpretation of ""1989"" offers a slowed-down take on her upbeat anthems. ""I got to work different parts of my brain, different parts of my heart and different parts of the musical aspects of my personality,"" Adams said of covering Swift's music. ""It's really its own thing. ...It's not the same record."" After completing his version, the singer-songwriter-producer played it for 25-year-old Swift before taking it any further. He namedropped Bob Mould as one his favorite musicians, but added in the same breath: ""But then I also love all those songs on (Swift's) 'Fearless' (album). I don't really have a place where my music begins and ends."" Adams said he has known Swift for about 4 years and counts himself as a fan. Adams released his debut album, ""Heartbreaker,"" in 2000. His 2014 self-titled record, his 14th studio release, earned him two Grammy nominations earlier this year, including best rock album. He has also found success as a producer for acts like Willie Nelson and Jenny Lewis. Adams says in 1989 — the year, not the album — he remembers being in love with music and being aware he wanted to make a career out of it. ""I was already collecting albums. By 15, I was skateboarding, I had gotten my first guitar,"" he said. ""I had my first record player and I remember I got my first couple of real albums that were my own records and I was really excited about them."" ---- Online: Ryan Adams: http://paxamrecords.com/"

The loan will be used to fund infrastructure and development projects, as well as to create job opportunities for the citizens of the state. In a statement, Governor Abdullahi Sule said that the funds would be used to support the state's efforts to provide employment opportunities for its people. ""This funding will allow us to create up to 1500 jobs in the state,"" Sule said. The governor added that the state government would prioritize the construction of key infrastructure projects such as roads and bridges, which would be critical to enhancing economic growth and development across the state. The N8bn bailout comes as part of the federal government's efforts to help states across the country to combat economic challenges and promote growth. The loan agreement was signed by both the Nasarawa state government and the federal government in a meeting held in the state capital, Lafia. The state government has assured the public that the funds would be used towards creating long-term benefits for the people of the state.

70,"West Bromwich Albion has turned down yet another bid from Tottenham Hotspur for striker Saido Berahino. Sources say that the bid was worth £23 million, which is an improvement on Tottenham's previous offer of £18 million, but it still fell short of West Brom's valuation of the player. Berahino has been a target for Tottenham for some time, with the club eager to strengthen their attacking options before the transfer window closes. However, West Brom have been hesitant to sell their star player and have made it clear that they will not accept anything less than their asking price. West Brom's manager, Tony Pulis, has publicly stated that Berahino is not for sale and that the club is focused on keeping their best players. Pulis has also praised Berahino's work ethic and contribution to the team. Tottenham, on the other hand, are in desperate need of a striker and have been heavily linked with Berahino throughout the summer. The club is now expected to turn their attention to other targets as they search for a new forward to lead their attack. Time is running out for Tottenham and other clubs looking to do business in this summer's transfer window, which closes at 11 pm on August 31.","West Brom have rejected a third bid from Tottenham for Saido Berahino, Press Association Sport understands. The offer, which arrived late on Tuesday, was only marginally better than Spurs' previous bid, which would have only risen to £21million with clauses and add-ons. The Baggies have instantly dismissed Tottenham's third approach and remain determined to keep the England Under-21 striker at The Hawthorns. Berahino had a transfer request rejected last month with Albion angered by Tottenham's continued pursuit of the 22-year-old. The Baggies are understood to be unhappy with Spurs' approach to the deal which has only strengthened their resolve to keep Berahino. The forward has been left out of West Brom's last three squads during the speculation with boss Tony Pulis insisting he was not in the right state of mind to play. Share article Spurs have been searching for more firepower to help Harry Kane and, despite signing Son Heung-min from Bayer Leverkusen, maintained their interest in Berahino. He scored 20 goals last season, and earned a call-up to the England senior squad, but missed Euro 2015 for the Under-21s with a knee injury."

The dollar may be down, but that doesn't mean packing away the passport permanently. In fact, New research, Expedia Value Tracker, reveals the best value spots for a Christmas trip overseas, and even the US figures as a possibility. That's because currency fluctuations are not the only monetary movement to factor in. Changes in accommodation, flight and living costs all contribute to the value of a holiday. For instance, New Zealand is the only destination where the Australian dollar currently goes further than it did a year ago, up four per cent year-on-year. But the average accommodation cost there has risen nine per cent, while average flight prices between NZ and Australia have decreased five per cent. That all adds up to Expedia considering New Zealand the best value option for Aussies right now. As for the US, the fact that flight costs have dipped 10 per cent in the past year offsets the dollar drop of 21 per cent and counting – a little. Expedia says travellers might find better value across the border in Canada this year, where the Australian dollar has only fallen six per cent against the Canadian dollar and flights decreased by six per cent year-on-year. That's especially relevant for those considering a Christmas ski break. Expedia Australia and NZ managing director MD George Ruebensal suggests, however, you think creatively. ""If travellers are flexible about where they go, there are opportunities to save. And when thinking about Europe, that's exciting as there are so many amazing places to explore. For instance, why not consider Norway where the Aussie dollar has gained ground against the Norwegian krone and average hotel and flight prices have also decreased."" The Aussie has also gained more than 30 per cent against the Russian ruble. No time to monitor it all? Sites like Expedia help. Its Scratchpad app tracks flight and hotel price movements for you.

The game, which took place on Sunday at the Leigh Sports Village, saw Leigh fall behind early on, struggling to keep up with the pace and intensity of their opponents. Despite their best efforts, Leigh found themselves outclassed by a disciplined and determined Halifax side, who took control of the game from the outset. The Centurions fought hard to stay in the match, but eventually succumbed to Halifax's relentless attack and superior defense.

74,"Manchester United defender Matteo Darmian has spoken of his desire to leave the club, stating that he sees his future elsewhere. The Italian right-back, who arrived at Old Trafford in 2015, has found playing time hard to come by in recent seasons, and is reportedly keen to secure a move away in order to revive his career. Speaking to reporters, Darmian stated that he is ""not at the apex of my career"", and that he is ""looking for new challenges"". While Darmian's time at United has been largely underwhelming, he remains a talented player who could potentially thrive at another club. The 29-year-old has previously attracted interest from a number of Serie A sides, and it seems likely that he will return to his homeland in the near future. Darmian's departure would likely come as a blow to United, who are already facing a defensive crisis following the injury to first-choice right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka. However, with other options such as Ashley Young and Diogo Dalot available, the club will likely cope with his departure.","Matteo Darmian does not see Manchester United as the 'apex' of his career.

A new report titled ""Market Research Report on Agrochemicals Market by Type (Fertilizers, Pesticides) - Global Market Trends & Forecast to 2018"" has recently been released, providing insights into the current state of the agrochemicals market and future growth prospects. According to the report, the agrochemicals market is segmented into two major categories: fertilizers and pesticides. The report predicts that the fertilizers segment will continue to lead the market, accounting for approximately two-thirds of the total market share. This is primarily due to the growing demand for bio-fertilizers and organic fertilizers. Among the different types of fertilizers, nitrogen-based fertilizers have the highest demand worldwide. The report suggests that the growing preference for high-yield crops will continue to drive the demand for nitrogen fertilizers. The report also suggests that the demand for bio-fertilizers is expected to grow at a significant rate over the forecast period. Bio-fertilizers are environmentally friendly and cost-effective, making them a preferred choice among farmers. The pesticides segment is also expected to grow over the forecast period as pests and diseases continue to pose a significant threat to crop health and yield. The report suggests that herbicides are the most widely used type of pesticide, with insecticides following closely behind. North America and Europe are the largest markets for agrochemicals, with Asia-Pacific expected to emerge as a significant market for agrochemicals in the coming years. The growing population in Asia-Pacific, coupled with the increasing demand for food, is driving the demand for agrochemicals in the region. The report suggests that the market is highly competitive, with major companies such as Bayer, BASF, and Syngenta dominating the market. These companies are focusing on new product launches and strategic partnerships to expand their market share. In conclusion, the agrochemicals market is expected to continue to grow, with increasing demand for food and agriculture products driving market growth. The fertilizers segment is expected to lead the market, while the pesticides segment is also expected to grow. North America and Europe are the largest markets for agrochemicals, with Asia-Pacific expected to emerge as a significant market in the coming years. The market is highly competitive, with major companies focusing on new product launches and strategic partnerships to expand their market share.","Agrochemicals Market by Type (Fertilizers, Pesticides), by Fertilizer Type (Nitrogenous, Potassic, Phosphatic), by Pesticide Type (Organophosphates, Pyrethroids, Neonicotinoides, Bio-Pesticides), & Sub-types - Global Market Trends & Forecast to 2018"" defines and segments Agrochemicals market with analysis and forecasting of market demand and revenue. This market would grow from an estimated $203,567.6 million in 2013 to $242,757.8 million by 2018, with a CAGR of 3.6% from 2013 to 2018.

It is a widely used term that includes fertilizers and pesticides. Agrochemicals help to increase the productivity of the crops by supplying needed nutrients and providing protection from various diseases, without harming the environment. Thus, the focus of industry players is not only to develop and launch agrochemicals, but also to train its end-users about the proper use of these chemicals. The tightening environmental regulations in developed regions such as North America and Europe are making it difficult for the manufacturers to sell their conventional products in these regions. Hence, they are bound to develop new products that fulfill environmental norms. It has, thus, become important for them to find a right balance between the product performance and content of their product. Early buyers will receive 10% customization on reports. According to the estimates, Asia-Pacific leads the market for Agrochemicals with 41.3% share in demand at global level in 2012, followed by Latin America (17.0%), North America (15.4%), Europe (7.8%), and Rest of the World (18.5%). Looking at fertilizers type, Nitrogenous fertilizers occupied 68.4% and Organophosphates occupied 73.0% share in demand in their respective agrochemicals type. The growth of the Agrochemicals Market has been studied through in-depth analysis of major factors that are driving the market such as growing population and increase in demand for food with opportunities in the development of environment friendly and rising consumer awareness for agrochemicals. However, the increasing environmental concerns and availability of other environment friendly alternatives are proving to be the major restraining factors for the market.

77,"The Mudgee branch of Amnesty International has welcomed the recent decision by the Australian government to resettle 12,000 Syrian refugees. The announcement comes after years of lobbying by Amnesty International and other refugee advocates, calling on the government to do more to support individuals fleeing violence and persecution in Syria. The Mudgee branch of Amnesty International has been at the forefront of this campaign, organizing rallies and petitions to raise awareness of the plight of Syrian refugees. The decision to resettle 12,000 Syrian refugees is a significant milestone in the campaign, and a testament to the hard work and dedication of Amnesty International and its supporters. Amnesty International's Australia Director, Claire Mallinson, said in a statement that ""this decision will save lives and provide hope to people who have lost everything"". Ms. Mallinson also called on the Australian government to ensure that those who arrive in Australia receive the necessary support and assistance to rebuild their lives. The resettlement program will prioritize women, children and families who have been affected by the Syrian conflict. The program will also provide additional support to those who have suffered trauma and other mental health issues as a result of the conflict. The Australian government has pledged $700 million to the program, which will be implemented over a number of years. This decision has been met with overwhelming support from the Mudgee community, with residents reaching out to Amnesty International to offer assistance to the refugees once they arrive. Many have offered to provide housing, employment and other support to the new arrivals. This outpouring of support highlights the generosity and compassion of the Mudgee community. The decision by the Australian government is also in line with international law and Australia's obligations under the Refugee Convention. It is a welcome departure from the government's previous policy of offshore detention and processing of asylum seekers. Amnesty International hopes that this decision will mark the beginning of a new era of support for refugees and asylum seekers in Australia. While there is still much work to be done to ensure that Australia meets its obligations to those seeking asylum, this decision is a step in the right direction. The Mudgee branch of Amnesty International will continue to advocate on behalf of refugees and asylum seekers, and will work to ensure that the resettlement program is implemented in a fair and compassionate manner. Through the dedication and hard work of Amnesty International and its supporters, we can make a difference in the lives of those who have been affected by conflict and persecution.","The Federal Government’s decision to accept 12,000 Syrian refugees into Australia is a start according to the convenor of Amnesty International’s Mudgee branch, Heather Drew. The Federal Government’s decision to accept 12,000 Syrian refugees into Australia is a start according to the convenor of Amnesty International’s Mudgee branch, Heather Drew. Ms Drew said Amnesty was pleased the Australian government has decided to take in some of the millions of Syrian’s unable to return home, especially considering how desperate the situation is getting. “It’s a start really,” Ms Drew said. “The number of Syrian people who are no longer able to return to their own country is in its millions, and all of these people are desperate to make a new home for themselves. “We’ve agreed to take 12,000 but the government may need to think about agreeing to take more.” Ms Drew said while some people had made suggestions that the number was too high, Germany had agreed to house 800,000 refugees that made their way to Europe. “Twelve thousand people sounds wonderful in comparison to the number Australia agreed to take a year ago, but compared to the total number of people who need help – maybe the government will need to look at the figures again,” Ms Drew said. Ms Drew said there are around four million Syrian refugees registered with humanitarian groups. A large percentage of these people are immigrated to neighbouring countries like Jordan and Lebanon, putting strain on the local economies and resources. “There are 7.6 million people who are internally displaced in Syria. People are saying this is the largest humanitarian disaster since the last world war,” Ms Drew said. Ms Drew said it was fantastic to see the public becoming involved in the issue, and believed it was a continuing level of public support that pushed the government to agree to help. “There’s word that quite a few towns around the country are willing to take rather large numbers of refugees and help them create new lives,” she said. “And a lot more people than the government has agreed to take in.” According to the federal government, women, children, and families from persecuted minorities sheltering in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey will take priority. The government will also spend $44 million supplying 240,000 refugees with cash, food, water and blankets in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan. Senior government officials said the first refugees could arrive by Christmas. It’s intended that the 12,000 will arrive within the financial year."

The company also increased its dividend to €1.10 ($1.17) per share, compared to €0.90 ($0.96) in the previous year. Neste CEO Matti Lievonen attributed the company's success to its focus on renewable products, stating that ""Neste's renewable business continued to drive growth in 2016."" He also highlighted the company's expansion into new markets, such as the United States and Canada, as a factor in its positive financial performance. In addition to its successful financial performance, Neste also made strides in sustainability efforts. The company's renewable diesel reduced greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 6.7 million tons in 2016, contributing to a cleaner environment. Looking to the future, Neste plans to invest even more in renewable diesel and expand its production capacity.

79,"The Eastern Riverina Chronicle can exclusively reveal that Malcolm Turnbull, Australia's former Prime Minister, has decided to forgo living at Kirribilli House, much to the relief of his neighbours. Kirribilli House, located in Sydney Harbour, has been the official residence of Australian Prime Ministers since 1956. Here, they reside in style, enjoying stunning views of the harbour and the Opera House. However, Turnbull has opted out of living at the historic site, choosing instead to take up residence in a lavish apartment in Sydney's CBD. The move has been met with mixed reactions. While some have questioned the former Prime Minister's decision not to reside at Kirribilli House, others have expressed relief that the neighbourhood will be spared the chaos that often accompanies the country's leader. The residents of Kirribilli and its surrounding suburbs are well versed in the disruptions caused by the Prime Minister's presence. Security restrictions often mean that roads are closed, cars are towed, and the area can become a no-go zone for locals. One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, expressed her relief at the news. ""We love living in Kirribilli, but it can be a nightmare when the Prime Minister is in residence. The security measures can be really disruptive, and it can feel like we're living in a war zone."" Another resident echoed the same sentiment, adding, ""We're thrilled that Turnbull won't be living at Kirribilli House. It means we'll be able to get on with our lives without having to worry about the constant security presence and road closures."" It's not just the residents who are relieved, however. Local businesses are also breathing a sigh of relief, with one café owner commenting, ""It's great news for the local economy. When the Prime Minister is in residence, it can be really difficult for people to get to us. It's great to know that won't be an issue anymore."" Despite these concerns, it's worth noting that the move isn't without precedent. Turnbull's predecessor, Tony Abbott, famously decided not to live at Kirribilli House, choosing instead to stay at his own home in Forestville. This decision was met with criticism at the time, with many feeling that Abbott was shirking his duties as Prime Minister by not living at the official residence. However, Turnbull has always been known for his independent streak, and his decision not to live at Kirribilli House is just one example of this. Whether it's a wise move remains to be seen, but for now, his neighbours are breathing a collective sigh of relief. As one resident put it, ""We're just happy to be able to get on with our lives without the extra stress and disruption that comes with having the Prime Minister as our neighbour.""","It is hardly humble, or peaceful, but it is home for Malcolm Turnbull. Inside Malcolm Turnbull's Point Piper pad It is hardly humble, or peaceful, but it is home for Malcolm Turnbull. The new Prime Minister says he will not be moving to Kirribilli House, but is staying put at his red-clay-coloured home in Point Piper, with its own fetching harbour views. Two days after his swearing in ceremony last Monday, a big yellow crane appeared behind his house for building work at a neighbouring property. There are at least five major construction and renovation projects underway in the neighbourhood, which comes to life in the early morning hours with the arrival of tradesmen in orange tops and fluorescent green socks tucked inside work boots. The constant hum of the towering crane that swings large skips full of boulders precariously close to the Turnbull rooftop is punctuated by loud beeping and a cacophony of roaring saws, drills and cement mixers. Two Australian Federal Police officers sit quietly inside a grey car parked outside the residence. But they have not gone unnoticed by neighbours, who have few complaints about the heightened security presence. Bernice Belnick welcomed her neighbour's decision to stay. ""I've been boasting I've got a PM in my street,"" she says. ""I'm happy for him to stay."" Another neighbour who did not wish to be named, said: ""He's got a great house. It's close to the city. Why should he move?"" ""I think it's important that they live normally. We often see Lucy [Turnbull] walking the dogs in the morning."" Further down the road, where white-washed walls are draped in red bougainvillea and black Porche Boxters sit in driveways, Caryl Heilig and Belinda Goldman take time out of their morning walk to share their approval. ""I have no problem with Malcolm staying in the area,"" Ms Goldman said. ""It think that it's great he has chosen to stay in his home. We are very happy that he'll be part of the Eastern Suburbs where we live."" Ms Heilig agreed it was ""fantastic"" the Turnbulls had decided to stay in the area. ""They may just put a bit more security around the house for him,"" she said. Jennifer Coyle, who moved from the US to a nearby house two months ago, said she was surprised a Prime Minister would live in the local neighbourhood. ""But we find it very refreshing that he has decided to stay in the local community,"" she said. The police presence makes her feel a bit safer in the home, ""but it is also a little disconcerting that they are around the corner 24/7"". Ms Coyle, who works for Macquarie Bank, said she could not imagine an American president living in her street. ""I think they would be so frightened for their security that they would be out of the limelight as much as possible,"" she said. ""It's really nice to see he [Turnbull] is out in the open. We saw him walking in the neighbourhood over the weekend. So it's really good to see he's part of the people."" Andrew Muston, who has lived in the area for 23 years, said it was clear to him why Mr Turnbull wanted to stay. ""I don't know why he would want to leave. It's a pretty nice set up that he's got."" Mr Muston, who graduated from the University of Sydney last year with an economics and finance degree, jokes that the decision poses one problem. ""The only issue is we have a couple of house parties, so I was hoping that maybe he might move away and there would be no more noise complaints,"" he said. ""No, he's a good neighbour. I've lived next to him my whole life. He's a good man."" When in Canberra, Mr Turnbull will live at The Lodge, which has undergone $6.4 million worth of renovations. The work is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Follow us on Twitter The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald."
80,"Discount retailer Poundworld has reported record sales figures for the past year, despite tough economic conditions and increased competition in the sector. The company, which operates over 350 stores in the UK, said that sales for the year ending March 31 were up 8.4% on the previous year, taking total revenue to £427m. The figures also revealed that like-for-like sales were up 5.6% over the same period. Poundworld said that the sustained growth was due to a number of factors, including investment in new stores, enhanced product ranges and improved customer experience across its estate. Managing Director, Kevin O’Connor, said: “These are great results for Poundworld and give us impetus to continue to grow and invest in our business. Despite challenging trading conditions, we have continued to focus on delivering fantastic value to our customers and it’s really paid off.” The news comes as Poundworld faces increased competition in the sector, with the likes of B&M, Home Bargains and Poundland all operating in the same space. However, O’Connor said that the company was confident of weathering the storm, adding: “We’re not complacent, but we firmly believe that our unique offer and customer experience sets us apart from our competitors.” Poundworld was founded in 1997 and has grown rapidly in recent years, thanks in part to the continued popularity of discount retailing amongst UK shoppers. The company joins a growing ranks of discount retailers that are thriving in the current economic climate. B&M reported a 19.4% rise in pre-tax profits earlier this month, while Home Bargains recently saw revenues surpass the £2bn mark for the first time.","UK-based discount chain Poundworld posted record annual sales today. The company said that it plans to continue its rapid expansion by opening 60 new stores a year from next year. The UK’s second-largest single price discount retailer, behind Poundland, said sales jumped 22% to £422.3m in the 12 months to the end of March in a period when it opened 38 stores, with like-for-like sales up 5.6%. The group added that operating profits also hit a record, more than doubling by 130% to £14.6m. US buyout group TPG took a majority stake in the business for £150m in May, in a deal which saw founder and chief executive Chris Edwards become a multimillionaire. Mr Edwards founded the business from a market stall in Wakefield in 1974. Poundworld said as a result of new funding from TPG it will accelerate its store expansion programme to in excess of 60 stores a year from 2016 onwards. Mr Edwards said: “We have seen a record financial year and one of landmark progress for the company.” He added that he expected “the year ahead to be one of development and consolidation.” Mr Edwards said the firm would invest in a new 500,000 square foot warehouse next to its Normanton head office in West Yorkshire, and replace its IT ordering systems. He said these changes “will provide a strong platform for rapid growth over the next three years.” The group added that its multi-price discount chain Bargain Buy, which trades from more than 50 outlets, saw like-for-like sales lift by 8% over the year. Larger rival Poundland, which owns around 500 stores, is in the middle of a £55m acquisition of rival 99p Stores. The takeover was last month provisionally cleared by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority."
81,"A new exit poll conducted after the election in Catalonia has shown that separatist parties will win a majority in the Catalan assembly. The poll, carried out by the Catalonian newspaper La Vanguardia, revealed that together, the three main separatist parties will obtain 74 seats in the 135-seat assembly. This is a significant victory for the separatists, who have been pushing for independence from Spain for years. Their win will likely reignite tensions between Catalonia and the Spanish government, and could potentially pave the way for another referendum on independence. The separatist coalition, which includes the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia), and Candidatures of Popular Unity (CUP), campaigned on a platform of independence and social justice. They have promised to hold a referendum on independence within the first two years of their mandate. The election also saw the rise of the far-right party Vox, which obtained 11 seats in the assembly. Vox opposes separatism and has called for the suspension of Catalan autonomy. Their presence in the assembly could complicate negotiations between the separatists and the Spanish government. The turnout for the election was high, with over 70% of eligible voters casting their ballots despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, concerns have been raised about some voters being unable to vote due to restrictions put in place to prevent the spread of the virus. The results of the election are expected to have implications beyond Catalonia, with many other regions in Europe also experiencing separatist movements. The European Union has traditionally been opposed to separatism, but may have to re-evaluate its stance in light of the Catalan election results. The Spanish government has yet to comment on the exit poll results, but tensions between Catalonia and Madrid are likely to increase in the coming days. The separatists are expected to push for negotiations with the central government, but it remains to be seen whether any progress will be made towards Catalan independence.","Supporters of secessionist group Junts Pel Si celebrate after polls closed in a regional parliamentary election in Barcelona that saw separatists win a clear majority of seats in Catalonia's parliament. Separatists have won a clear majority of seats in Catalonia's parliament, an exit poll showed on Sunday, in an election that could set the region on a collision course with Spain's central government over independence. The main secessionist group ""Junts pel Si"" (Together for Yes) would get between 63 and 66 seats in the 135-strong assembly, while smaller leftist party CUP would secure another 11 to 13 seats, according to the poll released by local broadcaster TV3, the largest carried out. They would jointly obtain 49.8 per cent of the vote, amid a an expected record turnout, in what would be a big boost to a secession campaign which has been losing support over the last two years. ""Junts pel Si"" and CUP had said before the vote that such a result would allow them to unilaterally declare independence within 18 months, under a plan that would see the new Catalan authorities approving their own constitution and building institutions like an army, central bank and judicial system. The Spanish centre-right government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, which has opposed attempts to hold a referendum on secession, has called the breakaway plan ""a nonsense"" and vowed to block it in court. Spain's constitution does not allow any region to break away. Catalan secession remains highly hypothetical, but the strong pro-independence showing is a blow for Rajoy less than three months before a countrywide election. It also creates additional uncertainty over potential talks over a more favourable tax regime and laws that better protect language and culture, which analysts say are needed to soothe Catalan discontent. Many of the 5.5 million voters had said on Sunday that they did not believe Catalonia would become independent and had used their ballot as a way to press the Catalan and Spanish authorities to discuss those issues. - Reuters"
82,"India has long been recognized as one of the great world powers, and according to a recent statement made by a US envoy, the country is determined to reclaim its position on the global stage. US Ambassador to India, Kenneth Juster, made the remarks at a recent event in Mumbai, where he praised India's growing economy and expanding infrastructure. He stated that despite the challenges facing the world today, India was poised to become an even greater force to be reckoned with in the years to come. Juster noted that India's commitment to democracy, along with its rapid growth in technology and industry, made it a key player in the global arena. He also acknowledged the country's efforts towards energy independence, adding that India's development of renewable energy sources would play a major role in the fight against climate change. India has made significant progress in recent years in terms of economic and social development. Its GDP has steadily risen, and it is projected to become the world's third-largest economy by 2030. The country has also made great strides in areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, with initiatives such as the 'Smart Cities' project and the 'Make in India' campaign. However, India's road to becoming a global power has not been without its challenges. The country has faced ongoing issues with corruption and bureaucratic red tape, as well as regional conflicts and tensions with neighboring countries. Despite these hurdles, however, India remains confident in its ability to overcome these obstacles and achieve its goals. Juster's comments come at a time when US-India relations are becoming increasingly important. The two countries have developed a strong partnership in recent years, with cooperation in areas such as defense, trade, and energy. US President Donald Trump has also expressed his admiration for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, calling him a ""true friend"" of the United States. At the same time, however, there have been some tensions between the two countries, particularly over trade issues. The US has recently imposed tariffs on Indian goods, and India has responded by increasing tariffs on US products. These tensions have raised concerns about the future of the US-India partnership, and the impact it could have on India's efforts to become a global power. Despite these challenges, however, India remains committed to its goal of becoming a major player on the world stage. The country has been actively seeking to forge closer ties with other countries, including China, Russia, and Japan. It has also been working to enhance its military capabilities, with the aim of becoming a key player in the region. India's efforts to reclaim its position as a global power are driven by a desire to promote its own interests, as well as to have a greater impact on the world stage. The country has a long history of contributing to global affairs, and it is determined to continue doing so in the years to come. In conclusion, India's recent achievements and dedication to growth and development have put it in a strong position to reclaim its position as one of the great world powers. While it may face challenges along the way, the country's commitment to democracy, innovation, and sustainability will continue to drive its progress. As Ambassador Juster noted, India has the potential to become a true global leader, and the world will be better for it.","Auckland News.Net Thursday 17th September, 2015 U.S. Ambassador to India, Richard Verma, has said that the developments of the past year show that India is determined to emerge from its slumber as the second sleeping giant of Asia and reclaim its historical position as one of the great world powers. ""Indian leaders have expressed a determination to leave behind the traditions of non-alignment and strategic autonomy and, in the words of Foreign Secretary Jaishankar, to become a 'leading power',"" he added. Verma said the strategic partnership between India and the US will be unlike the geo-political alliances of the 20th century. ""Rather than remaining confined to one corner of our planet, we will work to uphold the global systems and spaces that will allow for the continued advancement of humankind. In the words of Prime Minister Modi the great promise of the U.S.-India relationship is what both countries ""can do together for the world."" To be sure, the U.S.-India strategic partnership will be anchored in Asia,"" said Verma. ""But it will also be a truly 21st century relationship of natural allies working together in cyberspace, global hotspots, outer space, the human genome and the global biome,"" he added. Asserting that India is seeking to make up for lost time, the US envoy said India is still grappling with a legacy of systemic economic challenges that have hampered its growth in comparison to other Asian powers in the 20th century. ""However, India has exerted a profound historical impact on the global economy, and is poised to do so again. For much of recorded history, until the 18th century in fact, India's GDP matched or exceeded that of China and dwarfed production in Europe,"" said Verma. ""As the birthplace of Buddhism and a historical center of Sufi Islam, India's cultural influence extends from Southeast Asia to Mongolia and from Indonesia to the steppes of Central Asia,"" he added. The US envoy said the relationship between New Delhi and Washington will serve as an important new buttress safeguarding open commerce and freedom of navigation in the Asia-Pacific region. ""Through dialogues such as the U.S.-India East Asia Consultations which the East West Center graciously hosted in June and the U.S.-India -Japan Trilateral Dialogue, we are working together to promote a democratic and rules-based vision for political and economic security in Asia,"" said Verma in his remarks on ""An Alliance for Global Prosperity"" at EWC, Hawaii. ""But our bilateral relationship will be much more far-reaching. The U.S. and Indian governments are engaging agricultural professionals from Kenya, Malawi and Liberia to improve food security in their countries by increasing crop yields using new technologies,"" he added. The US envoy said India's generic pharmaceutical industry and highly skilled biotechnology workforce will be essential to addressing the greatest health challenges in all countries across the economic spectrum. ""Our countries are exchanging findings from current Mars missions and are sharing ideas about future explorations. Prime Minister Modi recently hosted the third USAID-supported Call to Action Summit to end preventable maternal and child deaths,"" said Verma. ""The United States and India have joined forces to advance a multi-stakeholder model of internet governance and are working to bring together industry, academia and regulators in both our countries in support of this vision. These are just a few examples that show how the scope of our alliance will not limited by geography or sector but will encompass the full spectrum of human endeavor,"" he added. Verma said as the Indian governments have come and gone the ideal of a multiethnic democracy has remained at the very core of the national consciousness. ""In this way India was perhaps the first truly 21st century country. In the decades after 1947, the freedom riders who were trained in Gandhi's ideals and methods, and in some cases in India by Gandhi's associates themselves, helped the United States begin to come to terms with our own history of injustice, providing the reconciliation that allowed for our post-Cold War prosperity and influence,"" he added. Verma said the commitment to a democratic system and the rule of law that have made India an island of stability in a continent that has seen tremendous upheaval in the past 50 years will continue to provide the Indian people the platform on which to construct their 21st century emergence. ""That India has lifted millions out of poverty and many of its 1.2 billion people have prospered while living under a transparent system of government demonstrates that the principles both countries hold dear are not ""American"" or ""Asian"" but human aspirations,"" said Verma. ""This shared view of a government that is inclusive and accountable to its people has resulted in India, despite its considerable economic challenges, leading the pack in a number of key indicators. Indian citizens are among the world's most numerous and active social media users - much has been written about the Indian impact on platforms such as Twitter and Instagram,"" he added. The US envoy said the Indian innovators are among the most successful and prolific patent applicants in the world, and Indian companies, drawing on a highly educated English speaking workforce, are deeply integrated into global business processing. ""Recent controversies notwithstanding, India's civil society is composed of tens of thousands of vocal and active NGOs that are influencing policy and budgets around the country. In this century, the advancement of prosperity will require the ability to nurture innovations, energize global audiences with new ideas and build cross-cultural understanding,"" said Verma. ""I need only to consider the number of Indian citizens using Facebook on cell phones charged by village entrepreneurs selling solar power to be certain that India is primed to succeed in these challenges,"" he added.

83,"Ankara - Turkey's foreign trade deficit has narrowed sharply in August as exports increased by a double-digit figure. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK), the country's foreign trade deficit fell by 58.6% to $1.4 billion dollars in August 2020. During the same period, Turkey's exports increased by 42.2% to $16.1 billion, while imports decreased by 2.6% to $17.5 billion. The year-on-year increase in exports was mainly due to higher sales of automotive and industrial goods. The country also saw a surge in exports to its largest trading partner, Germany, with an increase of 35.3%. The sharp drop in imports was largely due to a decrease in energy imports, particularly crude oil and natural gas. The country's energy import bill fell by 39.9% year-on-year. Turkey, a major emerging market with a developing export sector, aims to improve its trade deficit in the long-term. The country has been working to boost its export capacity and to reduce its dependence on imports. Despite the recent global economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Turkey has managed to maintain its export momentum, helping to alleviate the pressure on the country's current account deficit.","Turkey's foreign trade deficit dropped sharply in August, the Turkish Statistical Institute reported on Wednesday. In August, the deficit declined to $4.88 billion, down from $8.11 billion from same month last year, a drop of 39.8 percent. Exports were $11.65 billion, a 2.8 percent decrease from August 2014, and imports were $15.95 billion dollars, an 18.2 percent decline year-on-year. Turkey’s exports declined by 8.7 percent to $95.67 billion in the first eight months of this year, from $104.8 billion in the same period of last year, while imports tumbled16.9 percent in the same period. The devaluation of the lira against major currencies in the past year has made imported goods more expensive for Turkish consumers. Overall imports from January to August were down from $54.42 billlion to $45.24 billilon. The Turkish Exporters Assembly has attributed the exports slowdown to the weak global economy as well as to the fall of the euro against the dollar -- the decline, however, is in value, while Turkish exports increased in overall volume during the first eight months of this year."
84,"Wesley Snipes, the iconic actor known for his roles in blockbuster movies like ""Blade"" and ""Demolition Man,"" is making his long-awaited return to TV. For fans of the enigmatic actor, the news is nothing short of exciting - but even those who might not be familiar with Snipes' illustrious career have plenty of reasons to bet on his comeback. As reported by Canton Daily Ledger, Snipes is set to star in a new drama series that centers around the world of high-stakes gambling. Aptly titled ""The Player,"" the show promises to be an electrifying ride from start to finish. The premise is simple - a former military operative turned security expert (played by Snipes) becomes embroiled in a dangerous underground gambling ring. Tensions run high as the protagonist battles the various forces at play, all while trying to navigate the complex world of high-stakes gambling. For fans of Snipes, the show presents a unique opportunity to witness the actor's unparalleled charisma in action once again. Snipes rose to prominence in the 1990s as one of Hollywood's most bankable stars, thanks to his intense performances and undeniable on-screen presence. Even in supporting roles, Snipes has always managed to grab the audience's attention with his effortless cool and commanding presence. But beyond just being a platform for Snipes' talents, ""The Player"" promises to be a thrilling ride in its own right. The world of underground gambling is one that few viewers will be intimately familiar with - and as such, the show has the potential to offer a glimpse into a world that is both dangerous and alluring. From high-stakes poker tournaments to illegal sports betting, the drama promises to offer a window into a seedy underbelly of society that is often kept hidden from view. Of course, the actor's return to TV after a long hiatus raises the question of whether he can still perform at the same level as he did in his prime. But for those concerned about Snipes' ability to pull off a lead role in a TV show, it's worth noting that the actor has never really stopped working. Most recently, he had a supporting role in Eddie Murphy's acclaimed ""Dolemite Is My Name,"" which showcased his effortless comedic timing and acting chops. Furthermore, Snipes has always been a versatile actor who has never shied away from challenging roles. In ""Blade,"" he played a half-vampire, half-human hybrid; in ""Jungle Fever,"" he portrayed a drug addict struggling with his addiction. If anything, Snipes' range as an actor has only grown over the years, and there's little doubt that he's more than capable of carrying a TV show on his shoulders. Overall, ""The Player"" presents a unique opportunity for Wesley Snipes to remind viewers of his incredible range and acting skills. For fans of the actor, it's a chance to see him in a role that is tailor-made for his unique talents. For everyone else, it's a thrilling TV show that promises to offer a glimpse into a world that few of us have ever seen before. So why should you bet on Wesley Snipes' return to TV? Simply put, because he's one of the most talented actors of his generation - and ""The Player"" promises to be another showcase of his incredible skills.","NBC's new drama The Player has one of the most ridiculous premises of any of the new fall TV shows -- but that's not a bad thing. Unlike so many of the shows trying to ""cut through the clutter"" with a splashy concept, The Player knows exactly what it wants to be: a high-octane crime thriller that doesn't take itself too seriously. And it shouldn't with a setup like this: Alex Kane ( Philp Winchester ) is a private security specialist in Las Vegas who, after the murder of his wife Ginny ( Daisy Betts ), is pulled into a long-running conspiracy involving the richest people in the world gambling on crime. With the help of ""pit boss"" Mr. Johnson ( Wesley Snipes ) and ""the dealer"" Cassandra ( Charity Wakefield ), Alex, as ""the player,"" tries to stop crimes while the fat cats in ""the house"" bet on or against his ability to save the day. Got all that? ""We knew we wanted to make a pulp show,"" co-creator John Rogers tells TVGuide.com . ""The way pulp works is to find a good, simple, defining metaphor, and we said, 'What are the elements of gambling?' If you're going to have a conspiracy, you're going to have code names, you're going to a have a structure. When we looked at the basic form of gambling, the feel of a casino, and it just came very naturally. People understand those terms -- millions of people gamble. We're not introducing obscure vocabulary to explain our very high-concept, obscure conspiracy."" Fall Preview: Check out all the must-watch new shows But it was also important for Rogers to have some emotional context beneath all the Las Vegas window-dressing. ""Everyone right now feels as if maybe the rules were changed on them,"" Rogers says. ""You sent your kids to college, but somehow your college graduate is living in your basement because he can't get a job. It feels like we're trapped in a game that somebody changed the rules. We said, 'Why don't we externalize that? Why don't we talk about the fact we are trapped in a game, and there's one guy in the middle of it who is on our side?' That gave us the emotional stakes of the show."" Page 2 of 3 - For Alex, his journey is entirely fueled by the heartbreak he feels over the death of his wife. ""Trying to resolve how Ginny died and why she died and who's responsible, is the primary emotional thrust of his investigation,"" Rogers says. ""That's the thing that keeps him going back undercover into this organization."" And continuing to go back in is an issue. After all, the whole concept of a group of people profiting off of crime rather than trying to prevent it is pretty icky, right? ""They're doing a horrible thing,"" Rogers says with a laugh. ""It allows us to have some fun every week, but they're plainly bad guys. Alex is a good guy in the middle of a bad system. One of the essential questions of the show is: Is that system actually the best possible system that we can live with?"" Because of Alex's unease about what he's doing, The Player is unlike most procedurals where the team is one big happy family. Instead, when, in the pilot, Alex threatens to kill Mr. Johnson one day in the not-too-distant future, you're inclined to believe him. However, the team still has to rely on each other, regardless of how much they trust their colleagues. ""Everyone has their own agenda, everyone has their own secret plan, and everyone has their own sort of shifting allegiances,"" Rogers says. ""They are in a life-and-death world, and they have to trust each other as far as they can to not die, but never trust each other enough to make themselves vulnerable."" The Player 's Wesley Snipes and more familiar faces in new places That central conflict will certainly begin to define Mr. Johnson's moral ambiguity, which is exactly what attracted Snipes to the role. ""I get to explore some character work in a way that I probably couldn't in a feature film,"" Snipes says. ""You never know which side he's playing for. You'll learn quickly that Mr. Johnson knows secrets that no one else knows. He's seen a lot of players come and go, and this guy is nothing special at this point. Or so we make it appear. Mr. Johnson has another card that he hasn't played yet. There's a whole deck that Mr. Johnson hasn't played yet."" However, Rogers is quick to caution people from deciding outright that Mr. Johnson is the bad guy. ""There are weeks that Mr. Johnson does something heroic because it fits his sense of personal ethics, and you're like, 'Yeah, I love Mr. Johnson!'"" Rogers says. ""Then, there are days that he's the most horrible human being in the world. I don't know if you ever want to be rooting for him, but you should be fascinated by him. ... His views on power are not necessarily wrong, they're just horrible."" Page 3 of 3 - Then again, Alex isn't an entirely noble hero either. ""He's saving lives. He genuinely enjoys the work, but Alex Kane has a problem. He is a man with a high capacity for violence and a tendency towards it,"" Rogers says. ""To a great degree the two themes for the show are power and addiction. We all have behaviors we're drawn to. We all have those things we can't let go of, be it Ginny's death or the constant fall into violence which comes very easily to him. We all have these desires that are beyond our control, and how we deal with them to a great degree is what defines us."" Although the show is clearly reveling in its procedural makeup (""I love the one-and-done of it,"" Rogers confesses), the writers are telling a longer story. However, the central mystery of Ginny's murder, which gets much more messy by the end of the pilot, won't be stretched out forever. ""The mystery of how that happened, who did it, why it was done -- all of that is meant to be an important thing that we reveal to the audience over the course of the first 12 episodes,"" Rogers says. ""We're not going to hold you over a barrel for five years. Most of the questions in the first season will be resolved by the end of the first season."" The Player premieres Thursday at 10/9c on NBC.

86,"New York, NY - The stock market is set to open higher on Friday, as investors anxiously await the release of the highly anticipated U.S. jobs data later in the day. Wall Street had a mixed session on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 both ending modestly higher. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite snapped a four-day winning streak, closing slightly lower. Investors are eagerly awaiting the latest U.S. jobs data for August, which is due to be released later in the day. The data is expected to give a clearer picture of the state of the U.S. economy and could have an impact on the Federal Reserve's timeline for tapering its bond purchases. Analysts are forecasting that the report will show the U.S. economy added 750,000 jobs in August, which would be the highest monthly gain since last August. The unemployment rate is expected to tick down slightly to 5.2%, from 5.4% in July. While a strong report could be seen as positive for the stock market, it could also prompt the Federal Reserve to move sooner in its tapering plans. The central bank is currently buying $120 billion in bonds each month to support the economy amid the pandemic. Investors will also be keeping an eye on any updates regarding the U.S. infrastructure bill, which is currently being debated in Congress. The $1 trillion bill includes funding for roads, bridges, and broadband internet, among other things. In corporate news, shares of Peloton (PTON) are set to be in focus after the exercise equipment maker recalled all of its treadmills following reports of injuries and the death of a child. The company is now offering customers a full refund. Meanwhile, Tesla (TSLA) shares could see some movement after the electric car maker announced that it is planning to open its first store in India. The move comes as Tesla looks to expand its presence in the growing Indian market. Other stocks that could be in focus include Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Facebook (FB), as tech stocks continue to be in demand thanks to their strong growth prospects. In summary, the stock market is set to open higher on Friday ahead of the release of the key U.S. jobs data for August. Investors will be closely watching the data to get a better sense of the state of the U.S. economy, which could have an impact on the Federal Reserve's tapering plans. Meanwhile, corporate news and updates on the infrastructure bill could also impact the markets.","By (Reuters) - Wall Street rose on Thursday after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi hinted at additional stimulus measures and ahead of a key U.S. jobs report that could figure in the Federal Reserve's decision about when to lift interest rates. Major U.S. indices relinquished stronger gains of over 1 percent but stayed in positive territory, with ongoing worries about China's economy on the minds of investors. ""Whether it's in the U.S., Japan or Europe, the market likes quantitative easing,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. ""But China concerns have not gone away."" ""I’m expecting choppiness for a while longer."" Draghi's remarks came a day ahead of the monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls data, which is expected to show that the economy added 220,000 nonfarm jobs in August, up from 215,000 in July. The combination of a healing U.S. labour market and worries about a stumbling Chinese economy are challenging the Fed as it heads into a meeting on Sept 16-17 where it may raise interest rates for the first time since 2006. Near-zero rates have allowed the U.S. stock market to stage a spectacular bull-run since the financial crisis. But the market was rocked by volatility in the past two weeks, triggered by fears of slowing growth in China. Some investors believe the market turmoil, which left the S&P 500 with its biggest monthly drop in three years in August, may lead the Fed to delay a rate hike until the end of the year. The CBOE Volatility index .VIX, known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge"", fell 1.65 percent to 25.64 on Thursday, slightly above the long-term average of 20. The index had spiked as much as 53.29 early last week. At 2:53 pm, the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 0.37 percent to 16,412.58 and the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.41 percent to 1,956.93. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.09 percent to 4,754.28. Nine of the 10 major S&P sectors were higher, with the telecommunications index's .SPLRCL 1.0 percent rise leading the advancers. Apple was the biggest drag on S&P 500 with a 1.36 percent drop while Intel's 2.15 percent gain helped push the index higher. Joy Global's shares were down 16 percent after the mining equipment maker reported a fall in quarterly profit and cut its full-year forecast. Caterpillar also fell 2.6 percent and was the biggest drag on the Dow. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,961 to 1,012. On the Nasdaq, 1,530 issues rose and 1,236 fell. The S&P 500 index showed no new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 28 new highs and 32 new lows.

87,"Liverpool Football Club is reportedly keeping a close eye on Real Madrid midfielder Dani Ceballos ahead of a potential January bid for the talented Spaniard. According to recent reports, Liverpool scouts have been watching Ceballos in action in the hope of adding him to their squad in the upcoming transfer window. Ceballos, who is currently on loan at Arsenal, has been catching the eye with his impressive performances in the Premier League this season. The 24-year-old has been a standout player for the Gunners, and Liverpool are said to be keen on bringing him to Anfield to bolster their midfield options. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is believed to be a big fan of Ceballos, and the German coach sees the midfielder as a player who can add some much-needed creativity to his side's midfield. With Liverpool currently struggling to break down opposition defences, Ceballos could prove to be a crucial addition to their squad as they look to defend their Premier League title. While Liverpool would undoubtedly face stiff competition for Ceballos' signature, the Reds have a strong reputation for attracting top players to Anfield, and this could work in their favour in any potential negotiations. It is also worth noting that Ceballos has previously stated that he would be open to a move to Liverpool, which could further boost the Merseyside club's chances of landing him in January. Of course, any move for Ceballos would come at a cost, and Liverpool would need to part with a significant sum of money to secure his services. However, given his impressive form this season and his potential to contribute to Liverpool's success, it is a cost that the Reds may be willing to pay. Overall, the news that Liverpool are monitoring Dani Ceballos ahead of a possible January move will undoubtedly excite fans of the club. Klopp's side have struggled to find their rhythm this season, and the addition of a player like Ceballos could be just what they need to get back to their best and mount a serious challenge for honours.","Liverpool fans, hello and welcome to your daily round-up.

The youngster has less than a year remaining on his contract and a buy-out clause of £7.5million, with Liverpool having the option to attempt to purchase him for a cut-price fee in January. It’s said they will face competition from Arsenal, with Ceballos looking likely to sign a pre-contract agreement for an English move next year. Balotelli's Real joke Meanwhile Mario Balotelli has admitted that Real Madrid are a ‘dream club’, refuting reports that he made a joke about them in the past. The Italian took to Twitter to slam those who said he had aimed a dig at Real via a statement about Barcelona, claiming he would never make fun of Los Blancos.

88,"Country music has come a long way since its humble beginnings in the rural towns and plantations of the American South. From bluesy ballads to foot-tapping hoedowns, the genre has evolved and expanded over the years, incorporating new sounds and styles along the way. However, the recent trend of blending country music with rap, soul and EDM has raised some questions about what defines the genre and whether it is still country music at all. The latest artist to stir up controversy with this new musical fusion is Thomas Rhett, whose fourth studio album, ""Center Point Road"", features collaborations with artists from diverse genres, including pop star Ed Sheeran and rapper Kelsea Ballerini. The result is a mix of country twang, soulful R&B and upbeat dance rhythms that has left some fans scratching their heads. To be fair, Rhett is not the first country artist to experiment with these styles. In recent years, artists like Keith Urban, Florida Georgia Line and Sam Hunt have all incorporated elements of rap, hip-hop and EDM into their music, creating a new subgenre often referred to as ""bro country"" or ""country pop"". While these songs have been popular, they have also drawn criticism from traditionalists who argue that they are diluting the authenticity and heritage of country music. The debate over what defines country music is not a new one. From the early days of the Grand Ole Opry to the modern era, there has been a tension between the commercial appeal of popular music and the cultural roots of country music. As the genre has evolved and expanded, these tensions have only grown more pronounced. Some see the fusion of country with other genres as a natural evolution of the music, while others view it as a betrayal of its heritage. So, is country music still country music when it incorporates rap, soul and EDM? The answer, of course, depends on whom you ask. For some, the answer is a resounding no. They argue that country music should be about storytelling, authenticity and tradition, and that adding outside influences waters down the genre and robs it of its identity. For others, however, the answer is more nuanced. They see the fusion of country with other genres as a way to keep the music fresh and relevant, and to appeal to audiences who might not otherwise be interested in country music. They point to artists like Rhett and Hunt, who have created a new sound that appeals to younger listeners and has helped to expand the fan base of country music. The truth is, there is no right or wrong answer. Country music, like any other genre, is constantly evolving and adapting to new influences and trends. What defines it today may not be what defined it yesterday or what will define it tomorrow. As long as the music speaks to audiences and reflects the cultural and social context of its time, it is still country music. In the end, it is up to the listeners to decide what they consider to be country music. Whether they prefer the traditional sound of Hank Williams or the modern fusion of Thomas Rhett, the most important thing is that the music speaks to them and reflects their own experiences and emotions. As long as that is true, the debate over what defines country music will continue, but it will be a debate worth having.","Country music sort of lives in this bubble, and everyone is a little bit scared to poke that… By Sarah Boesveld September 14, 2015 12:09 PM The country radio DJ pauses before biting the bullet: “Has anyone been like ‘What the hell are you doing?'” she asks. “Every single day,” Thomas Rhett says without missing a beat. A half hour earlier, a dozen industry types, seated before a massive control board and a big cake sheet lined with strawberries, bopped their heads to Rhett’s “progressive” country record — one marketed to lead a sonic shift in a genre of which they are still the gatekeepers. “Oooh, you look so dang hot in my T-shirt” thumps one track — titled T-shirt, appropriately enough — that likens the girl in the song to a model in a Guns ‘N Roses video. “Pour a little liquor in my coconut water” repeats the infectious hook of Vacation. There’s a rap interlude from Lunch Money Lewis; a sexy duet with pop star Jordin Sparks. The artist blaring from the speakers sat just outside the listening session — too nervous, he said, to watch people take in tracks from his sophomore album ‘Tangled Up.’ He strides in when it’s over, bedroom eyes scanning the room for a reaction. “It’s fun,” the group initially declares before the question on everyone’s mind gets asked. The son of 90’s country singer and Nashville songwriter Rhett Akins, Rhett made his debut in 2013 with ‘bro’ songs like ‘Get Me Some of That’ and ‘It Goes Like This’ — his star seemingly reliant on the dirt road theme of the day. But in the past year, Rhett’s undergone a metamorphosis: first with his BeeGees-inspired ‘Make Me Wanna’ and then with ‘Crash & Burn,’ the Sam Cooke-style debut single off a forthcoming record that marries soul, pop, disco, electronic dance music (EDM) and a dash of rap with what’s typically known as country. The single Rhett was terrified to release has since become his fastest rising, biggest selling song. And nestled in the Country Billboard Top 10 this summer betwixt hits like Sam Hunt’s party-hearty ‘House Party’ and ‘Like a Wrecking Ball,’ the soulful sex-jam from Erich Church, his risk at least feels of the moment. There is comfort in acknowledging the chart-busting success of genre-blurring acts like Florida Georgia Line (who Rhett has supported on tour), Luke Bryan and Hunt, whose nearly pure-pop and R&B debut album has made him something of a (controversial) pioneer. “It’s very liberating” Rhett said in an interview, reflecting on his move away from “bro” and towards something entirely new. “Someone the other day was like ‘Man, I don’t know if you know this, but I feel like you’re on the brink of leading a new direction of music. ’” But in the minds of traditionalists, a new direction isn’t something to which a country musician should aspire. To guys like Kyle Coroneos, who runs the website SavingCountryMusic.com, country is a genre not to be tampered with. Country music is about preserving tradition. It always has been and always will be. He calls this disco/EDM iteration a “bro-hangover.” The idea that bringing other genre-influences into country right now is risky, or pushing the envelope, or taking the genre somewhere new and exciting is disingenuous, he says. Instead, it contributes to one giant “mono-genre,” which he believes the merging of hip-hop and country has become. “The risk for country music is when you start going this far out of your boundaries, you begin to lose control of the music, you begin to lose control of your identity,” he said. “Country music is unique because it has so much of its own infrastructure and traditions — no other genre of music has four major awards shows every year, not even rock or EDM or rap. ” The genre-blending and trend-chasing is exactly the fate that befell rock radio, he said. “In the 1990s and early 2000s, rock became the catch-all phrase,” he said. “What happened was it lost its identity and it sort of imploded. I think it could happen” with country music. Rhett doesn’t believe his music is going to cause the downfall of country music. “We’re one of those genres that sort of lives in this bubble that everyone is a little bit scared to poke that bubble, because we’re worried about what will happen when that bubble breaks,” said Rhett. “To me, I want to be that artist that when my buddies are watching me side-stage, they’ll say ‘Dang, I can’t believe they just did that in their concert.’ Or they hear a song on the record and go ‘How in the world did they cut that song and get away with it?’ There’s something kind of rebelliously fun about it. ” He cites mainstream country rebel Church as inspiration, his latest rock-influenced record ‘The Outsiders’ is stacked with successful radio hits, despite its many middle-finger-to-the-man moments. But in the minds of critics, that rebelliousness is a far cry from the stuff of Willie & Waylon and more indicative of Nashville chasing the next biggest money-making thing. Despite all of the pop experimentation, the country music genre lives in two stubborn solitudes: There’s ‘real’ country and there’s that crap you hear on the radio. But if you’re going to refer to something as ‘real’ country, you have to have a definition of what ‘real’ country is. If Thomas Rhett wants to put out an album in the style of Bruno Mars and have EDM and R&B stuff … I am 100% for it. You go, Thomas Rhett. You do that. But don’t do it and sell it to country fans Country music’s identity is very much rooted in geography — there’s Texas Swing out of the Lone Star State; there’s Kentucky bluegrass, there’s The Bakersfield Sound in California, which was a grittier, more direct response to the slick sounds coming out of Countrypolitan Nashville. Perhaps the current outcry of traditionalists is a little reminiscent of the origins of rock ‘n’ roll — the combination of blues, country and gospel broke all the rules in the 1950s and pushed so many gatekeeper buttons. While Rhett’s hip gyrations are the closest he’ll ever get to Elvis, maybe his Bruno Mars covers are indeed pushing the boundaries in a good way — reminding the country music world that nothing ever new or interesting has come from colouring inside the lines. And if there would be no rock ‘n roll without blues, country and gospel, there would be no co…"
89,"Punk's Not Passed: The Resurgence of Punk Rock in Columbus Punk rock has been known for its anti-establishment, DIY attitude, and rebellious spirit since its inception in the mid-1970s. Despite facing its ups and downs in popularity over the years, punk’s essence has never truly faded away. And in Columbus, Ohio, the punk scene is thriving once again, with a new generation of bands and fans keeping the music and culture alive. The city’s punk roots can be traced back to the early ‘80s, when Columbus was home to bands like Greenhorn and Great Plains. But it wasn't until the mid-90s that the scene fully rocked with bands like New Bomb Turks, Gaunt, and Thomas Jefferson Slave Apartments. These bands achieved national recognition and played a major role in the independent music movement of the era. Fast forward to the present, and Columbus’ punk scene is re-emerging with a new energy. Local bands like Drose, Nervosas, and Bridesmaid are leading the charge, playing shows at venues like Ace of Cups, Big Room Bar, and Spacebar. “The scene is doing really well right now,” says Rick Eleck, owner of Used Kids Records and active member of the punk community. “Bands are getting to play shows, people are out supporting them, buying their records, it's great to see.” Eleck attributes the recent resurgence partly to the city’s relatively low cost of living, which allows musicians to focus on their art and not worry about the crippling expenses that come with living in larger cities like New York or Los Angeles. “Columbus has always had a great music scene, and punk has been a part of that,” Eleck adds. “It’s just going through a resurgence thanks to some really talented bands and supportive fans.” One of those fans is 25-year-old Alex Johnson, a self-proclaimed punk enthusiast who attends shows regularly. “The punk scene in Columbus is great right now,” Johnson says. “There are always shows happening, and the community is so supportive of the bands. Every show is like a big family gathering, with everyone coming together to have a good time and support the music.” Beyond the music, punk culture has always encompassed a strong sense of individuality, creativity, and social consciousness. Bands often use their platform to express their views on political and social issues, and fans embrace the punk ethos of rejecting mainstream ideals in favor of authenticity and DIY culture. “Punk is all about being true to yourself and not compromising your values,” says Eleck. “It's about expressing yourself and not caring what the mainstream thinks. The punk community is one of the most accepting and supportive communities out there, and that’s what keeps it going.” And while punk might still carry some negative stereotypes, like mohawks and leather jackets, today’s punk scene in Columbus is diverse and inclusive, welcoming people from all walks of life. “The punk scene is more than just a specific look or style,” Johnson says. “It's a community made up of different people expressing themselves in their own unique ways. That’s what makes it so special.” With a new generation of punk pioneers leading the way and an enthusiastic community supporting their efforts, Columbus’ punk scene shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. Whether you’re a longtime fan or just discovering the genre, there’s never been a better time to discover the punk spirit that’s alive and well in the heart of the city. Punk’s not passed—it’s alive and kicking.","In her Wexner retrospective, filmmaker Penelope Spheeris excavates her iconic and primal past It was Black Flag squatting in a dilapidated church. Darby Crash muttering his classic “puzzled panther” musings. A coked-up Ozzy cooking an egg, or the infamous scene of W.A.S.P. guitarist Chris Holmes chugging straight vodka from his swimming pool as his mother looks on. Director Penelope Spheeris’ iconic Decline of Western Civilization series of documentaries were fly-on-the-wall portraits of the Los Angeles’ subcultures in full bloom—and in mid-decay. But for the longest time, save the occasional midnight screening or happened upon bootleg VHS copy, the Decline films and their raw portrayal of the burgeoning punk and metal scenes were never given their proper due in the age of the DVD. That’s all about to change with the Shout! Factory re-issues of the entire trilogy, filled with hours and hours of extras giving Spheeris a closure to her work. There were no copyright issues or finagling with bands wanting a chunk of change in their twilight years—it was simply a matter of Spheeris feeling instinctively unnerved at watching her life pass before her. It was footage she couldn’t handle watching. Speaking with a very confident and still invigorated Spheeris, it was apparent she knows her arena as a filmmaker. Despite being responsible for hits such as Wayne’s World , Black Sheep , and, to a lesser degree, The Little Rascals , it’s the Decline films that have become her calling card and life’s work. The only way to convey her enthusiasm about her upcoming visit to the Wexner Center to introduce the landmark first film is through our brief, but enlightening conversation. Growing up around a lot of cultural shifts, during The Decline of Western Civilization , you were in your mid-30s. Were you a part of that scene? What drew you to document that particular punk scene in Los Angeles? I had been going to those punk clubs. I was definitely a part of the scene and I knew most of the people in the movie before I decided to make a movie. I was older, but I think I was still working out my childhood issues and I saw their childhood issues and decided to make a film about it. Speaking of childhoods, I truly feel that the film shaped the way I appreciate music and what I appreciate, so that’s a really good answer. Good. That’s good to hear. I guess the same question is relevant for The Decline of Western Civilization II: The Metal Years , which was made seven years later. Were you equally attracted to the metal scene in Los Angeles, or were you just playing the role of documentarian? I’ll have to be honest with you. I was going to those clubs too. I wouldn’t have made that movie if I wasn’t a part of that scene as well. I’m ashamed to admit that I was a part of that scene. You shouldn’t be ashamed. I think in a lot of ways, those first two films were blueprints for their respective scenes, or genres. Especially The Metal Years , where putting a band like London up against clips of Ozzy and Kiss posed an interesting juxtaposition. I haven’t talked about this much, because with these re-releases I didn’t want to watch any of it. I was forced to watch this again. I couldn’t handle it. But when I look at them I see so many aspects of attitude and style and trends that are still prevalent to everyday life. When I filmed them, they were unique. Just the jargon even, the language… the word “headbanging” for instance. I love the part when the audience members are explaining to you just exactly what “headbanging” entailed. Yeah. I think that was eventually a cemented part of our culture with the “Bohemian Rhapsody” scene in Wayne’s World . At the same time, it kind of killed the authenticity of something that was once an honest part of a culture. I didn’t want to even touch Wayne’s World and just focus on the Decline films, but I do think that for you, Wayne’s World may have been this zenith of punk and metal—like your ironic raspberry towards what was then considered “alternative.” I think I got to do Wayne’s World because of The Metal Years . There wasn’t anyone else who was a director in Hollywood who knew anything about that music either way. Plus I knew Lorne Michaels. It changed my life. I kind of wished I hadn’t made it only because I could have made the films I wanted to make but then I would’ve been broke. But yeah, it pokes fun at a lot from my past.” For me, seeing the original Decline was a sort of cultural gauntlet. I was 13 and watching from a dubbed VHS copy. Did you have the foresight when you made it that it could be that type of landmark for that scene and that music? Well there was a guy in Singapore the other day who asked me how the kids in the third Decline could have seen the first Decline since it wasn’t available, but you just explained it. What happened was, even though it wasn’t available it became an underground contraband and established it that way. Is there any kind of subculture or counter-culture that you see currently that is vital? Something that you would like to expose or document? What is IV? The answer to that and I’m sure you’ll understand, is that today everyone has a camera. I hate to say the subject matter because of that, because anyone can go and make that movie now. But somewhere deep down in the bottom of the hard drive of one of those movies is the beginning of Decline IV . I’m looking forward to doing it and people are always for it. Spheeris will introduce the original Decline of Western Civilization on Friday, October 23 at the Wexner Center at 7 p.m. Parts II and III will screen on Saturday, October 25 at 2 p.m."
90,"Smaller oil and gas producers are bracing for potential credit line cuts as lenders reassess the risk associated with energy loans, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. With the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic downturn, lenders are becoming more cautious about lending to energy companies, especially those with weaker balance sheets. This means that many smaller producers could see significant cuts to their credit lines, making it harder for them to maintain daily operations and fund new projects. This trend could have significant implications for the energy industry, as smaller producers often take on higher-risk projects that larger ones avoid. If these companies are unable to secure enough funding, it could lead to a reduction in overall production and potentially higher oil and gas prices in the future. The Journal notes that larger energy companies have already cut back on spending and taken steps to shore up their balance sheets, putting smaller producers in an even more precarious position.","The borrowing party is about to end for smaller and more debt-laden oil producers, WSJ reports, with drillers bracing for cuts to their credit lines next month as banks re-evaluate how much energy companies’ oil and gas properties are worth and the low price of oil catches up to the producers. Some smaller companies already are negotiating with their lenders, dumping assets at low prices and delaying payments to vendors. ""With eight bankruptcies already announced this year, weaker producers could live or die by the whims of capital providers,"" and banks will reduce borrowing bases by as much as 15%, according to Citi analysts, which WSJ says would dry up ~$10B of liquidity. More distress likely is in store for many companies because the hedges they purchased as protection against low oil prices are increasingly expiring.

92,"The Latest: Pastor: Slain Cameraman Made an Impact on Others ROANOKE, Va. – The pastor of the Virginia TV station shooting victim, Adam Ward, says his loss has left a profound impact on those close to him. Ward, 27, was a cameraman who was shot and killed by a disgruntled former colleague during a live television broadcast on Wednesday morning. Ward’s colleague, reporter Alison Parker, was also killed in the attack. In an interview with “13 WLOS”, Ward’s pastor, Mike Smith, described him as a “genuine person who made an impact on others”. He recounted Ward’s love for his family, his community, and his work. “Adam was the kind of person who, when he walked into a room, he was a light. He just had this way about him,” said Smith. Smith says he was close to Ward, and that his loss has left a hole in his heart. “It’s just devastating. Adam was one of those people who was always there for you. He had a servant’s heart, and he touched so many lives,” said Smith. Ward’s fiancee, Melissa Ott, was also present during the attack and witnessed him being shot. Ott is a producer at WDBJ7, the station where Ward and Parker worked. Smith says Ott is “struggling”, but has been surrounded by love and support from family and friends. In the wake of the shooting, tributes have poured in for Ward and Parker, with many expressing their shock and grief. “13 WLOS” reporter, Frank Volpicella, wrote a tribute to Ward on Facebook, describing him as “one of the best cameramen in the business” and “a joy to work with”. The shooter, Vester Lee Flanagan, who went by the on-air name Bryce Williams, died on Wednesday from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Flanagan, 41, had been fired from WDBJ7 in 2013 and reportedly had a history of conflict with co-workers. Authorities continue to investigate the shooting, which has reignited the debate on gun control in the United States. President Barack Obama has called for lawmakers to take action, saying that “it’s not enough to simply grieve for the victims and move on”. Meanwhile, Smith says he will remember Ward as a “kind, caring, and dynamic person”. “Adam had so much life ahead of him. It’s just heartbreaking that it was taken away,” said Smith.","September 01, 2015 16:32 GMT ROANOKE, Va.

93,"German automaker Volkswagen is facing a criminal probe over false emission claims, which resulted in a substantial financial hit. The scandal has left the automobile industry shaken, and led to a significant loss of consumer trust. The issue at hand pertains to the software installed in Volkswagen diesel engines designed to falsify emission readings. The company has now pleaded guilty to all charges and was ordered to pay a whopping $2.8 billion fine by the US Department of Justice. The fine helped to settle both criminal and civil charges brought against the company, which were brought forward by a joint coalition of state and federal agencies. This scandal has been dubbed the largest deception in the car industry to date, with Volkswagen admitting that it had installed the “defeat device” on approximately eleven million cars globally between 2009 and 2015. The device was intended to cheat emission tests by reducing nitrogen oxide levels during evaluations, despite the fact that the actual emission levels during regular operation far exceeded the limits imposed by regulators. According to the Department of Justice, Volkswagen executives went to great lengths to conceal the emissions scandal, and engaged in a cover-up conspiracy. The indictment filed claimed that “Volkswagen’s senior leadership, including its management board, repeatedly lied to regulators, engaged in obstruction of justice, and used a software-based defeat device to cheat U.S. emission standards.” In addition to the staggering financial hit, Volkswagen has also faced an immense backlash from consumers and environmentalists alike. The company’s reputation has taken a significant hit, not just in the United States but around the world. The European Union has also launched investigations into the matter, and regulators have imposed fines on the automaker. Environmental groups have also criticized the car industry for being too reliant on fossil fuels, and have called for the transition to alternative energy sources such as electric cars. The electric car market has been gaining momentum in recent years, and many experts believe it is the future of the automobile industry. Despite the significant financial and reputational damage caused by the emissions scandal, Volkswagen has been taking measures to move forward. The company has announced that it plans to invest heavily in electric cars, which could help it regain the trust of consumers. Volkswagen’s CEO Herbert Diess has acknowledged the company’s wrongdoing, and has vowed to make significant changes to prevent future scandals. In a statement, Diess said, “We can only apologize, and we will do everything we can to prevent something like this from ever happening again.” In addition, Volkswagen has been collaborating with regulators to develop new testing procedures that are more effective in detecting potential emissions cheats. The company has also been working on improving the emission levels of its diesel engines to meet stricter environmental standards. The emissions scandal has had far-reaching implications for the automobile industry, and for society as a whole. It has brought issues such as environmental pollution, corporate responsibility, and regulatory oversight into the spotlight, and has prompted regulators to take a closer look at the practices of car manufacturers. Going forward, the industry must take collective action to prevent future scandals, and work together to transition to alternative energy sources. This will require significant investment in research and development, as well as cooperation between car manufacturers, regulators, and environmental groups. As we move towards a greener future, it is essential that we learn from the mistakes of the past, and take steps to minimize the impact of the automobile industry on our environment. The emissions scandal has served as a wakeup call, and a reminder that we must all take responsibility for our actions, and work towards creating a more sustainable future.","The fuel economy and smog ratings are shown on the sticker price of a 2015 Passat limited edition vehicle at a Volkswagen dealership in Escondido, California, September 21, 2015. — Reuters pic FRANKFURT, Sept 22 — German auto giant Volkswagen’s shares plummeted nearly 20 per cent yesterday as investigations spread into revelations that hundreds of thousands of its diesel cars have software that secretly thwarts US pollution tests. Volkswagen, the world’s largest automaker by sales in the first half of this year, said it had halted all diesel vehicle sales in the United States during a probe into the scandal, which could lead to fines of more than US$18 billion (RM76.786 billion). In addition to the environmental fines, US authorities have reportedly launched a criminal investigation into the company. According to the US authorities, VW admitted that it had equipped about 482,000 cars in the US with sophisticated software that covertly turns off pollution controls when the car is being driven and turns them on only when it detects that the car is undergoing an emissions test. With the so-called “defeat device” deactivated, the car can spew pollutant gases into the air, including nitrogen oxide in amounts as much as 40 per cent higher than emissions standards, said the US Environmental Protection Agency, which announced the allegations Friday along with California authorities. “Using a defeat device in cars to evade clean air standards is illegal, and a threat to public health,” said Cynthia Giles, enforcement officer at the EPA. In Germany, currently hosting the Frankfurt motor show vaunting the industry’s strengths and environmental credentials, the government launched an investigation into whether Volkswagen or other carmakers are doing anything similar in Germany or Europe. Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt told the Bild daily that he had asked Germany’s Federal Motor Transport Authority “to immediately have specific and extensive tests conducted on all Volkswagen diesel models by independent experts.” South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said that authorities there, too, would conduct emissions tests on three Volkswagen car models in mid-October to check for similar deception. Beyond the potential fines and lawsuits, and the billions of euros that evaporated in Volkswagen’s stock market value as its shares plunged 18.19 per cent to €133 (RM635), wiping out more than US$15 billion, the company faces a potentially crippling blow to its reputation. Criminal probe launched The vehicles affected are four-cylinder VW and Audi diesel cars in the US built since 2008. In addition to the EPA’s probe, the US Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation into the German automaker’s alleged violation of US air pollution laws, according to media reports yesterday. First reported by Bloomberg, the criminal probe piles more pressure on VW. Contacted by AFP, neither the Justice Department nor Volkswagen chose to comment on the probe. The EPA said that the agency had not issued a formal recall for the VW vehicles but expects to “compel” the company to issue a recall to reduce the emissions impacts of those vehicles. “Depending on the complexity of the repair and the lead time needed to obtain the necessary components, it could take up to one year to identify corrective actions, develop a recall plan, and issue recall notices,” the US agency said. The EPA also said yesterday that it will screen for defeat devices in other manufacturers’ diesel vehicles currently on the road, though declined to identify the automakers whose vehicles will be tested. Deeply sorry VW chief executive Martin Winterkorn issued an apology Sunday, vowing that the group would cooperate with authorities and ordering an external investigation of its own into the matter. “The board of management takes these findings very seriously. I personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public. We will cooperate fully with the responsible agencies, with transparency and urgency, to clearly, openly and completely establish all of the facts of this case,” Winterkorn said. “We at Volkswagen will do everything that must be done in order to re-establish the trust that so many people have placed in us, and we will do everything necessary in order to reverse the damage this has caused. This matter has first priority for me, personally, and for our entire board of management,” Winterkorn said. Christian Stadler of Warwick Business School said there was “no question that this is a big problem for Volkswagen and could lead to CEO Winterkorn losing his job after all.” Winterkorn, 68, has been chief executive since 2007, but clashed with other leadership earlier this year. Image damaged Stefan Bratzel, director at the Center for Automotive Management, a research group, said the damage to VW’s image would be as great as the financial fines. Another leading German auto expert, Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, agreed. “It will be tough for VW to regain its credibility in the United States after this incident,” he said. In the US, Edmunds.com analyst Jessica Caldwell said “it is in Volkswagen’s best interest to publicly address steps to fix this mess as soon as possible before it loses its customer base for good.” German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel expressed confidence that VW would clear up the matter quickly and thoroughly. And he insisted the reputation of “Made in Germany” technology would not be tarnished. — AFP"

95,"The Senate President, Bukola Saraki, has confirmed the receipt of the list of ministerial nominees from President Muhammadu Buhari. The confirmation was made on Tuesday during the plenary session of the Senate. Saraki acknowledged the receipt of the list and stated that the Senate will give the nominees a thorough screening to ensure they possess the required qualifications and competence to serve as ministers of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. He also affirmed his commitment to the timely screening and confirmation of the nominees as he emphasized the importance of having a functional cabinet to aid the implementation of the government's policies and programs. The Senate President further assured Nigerians that the screening process would be transparent, fair, and devoid of any form of bias or sentiments. He urged his colleagues to approach the exercise with a high sense of responsibility and patriotism as they put the interest of the country first. It would be recalled that President Buhari on Tuesday sent his list of ministerial nominees to the Senate for screening and confirmation. The list contains 43 names, comprising 36 men and 7 women. The nominees cut across different political affiliations, professions, and backgrounds, and are expected to bring their wealth of experience and expertise to bear in the task of moving the country forward. The ministerial list has generated mixed reactions from Nigerians, with some commending President Buhari for the diversity and inclusion reflected in the list, while others criticized the delay in its submission, claiming that it had caused a setback in the development of the country. The opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has also expressed reservations about the list, alleging that it is filled with alleged corrupt individuals and that it lacked competence. However, these claims have been refuted by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), who noted that the PDP should be more concerned about regaining its relevance than attacking the integrity of the ministerial nominees. Meanwhile, Nigerians are eager to know the identity of the nominees and are anxiously anticipating the outcome of the screening exercise. The president had earlier hinted that his ministerial list would comprise of technocrats, professionals, and individuals who had demonstrated loyalty, dedication, and competence in their respective fields. The Senate has promised to commence the screening exercise as soon as possible so that the nominees can be confirmed and inaugurated to join the cabinet. It is hoped that the ministerial screening and confirmation process will be hitch-free and that Nigerians will be happy with the eventual outcome. The country is facing numerous challenges ranging from security to infrastructure, and a competent and functional cabinet would go a long way in addressing these issues. In conclusion, the confirmation of the receipt of the ministerial list by the Senate President is a step in the right direction, and it is hoped that the exercise will be carried out with the seriousness and urgency it deserves.",By Ikechukwu Okaforadi The Chief of Staff to President Mohammadu Buhari Lawal Kyari and the Special Adviser to the President on National Assembly matters Ita Enang yesterday evening submitted the first batch of President Mohammadu Buhari’s ministerial nominees to the Senate President Bukola Saraki In a twitter message by the Senate President he acknowledged the receipt of the list as at exactly 520pm yesterday even though no further details was made by him on those in the list “I can confirm that I just received the list of ministerial nominees from President Mohammadu Buhari” Saraki’s twitter handle said He had earlier twitted by 400pm during the waiting game for the ministerial nominees that he had yet to receive the list as at that time However earlier during the plenary the Peoples Democratic Party PDP senators had lamented that the President was keeping the nation in endless wait President Buhari had during his visit to United States of America in July told journalists that he will name his cabinet members in September a promise he further repeated in Ghana early last month that Nigerians will know his ministers by the end of September But when the list was not received as at yesterday plenary session of the Senate the Peoples Democratic Party PDP senators through the Minority LeaderGodswill Akpabio Akwa Ibom North West sought clarification Akpabio who came through a point of order under matter of urgent importance asked the Senate President Bukola Saraki on why he did not announce any communication from the President on ministerial nominees as widely expected and in line with the President’s promise He noted that the nation’s newspapers in the last couple of weeks have been awash with stories of ministerial appointments by the president and further asked the Senate President why he received the list from President Buhari and was hiding it from his colleagues As Saraki attempted to answer Akpabio’s question Deputy Senate LeaderIbn Bala Na’AllahAPCKebbi South raised another point of order upon which he explained that the day was still young saying since the day’s session ends by 1230pm there was still the hope that the president would transmit the list of ministerial nominees to the Upper Chamber before the close of the session He also said since the day ends by 1159pm there was still hope that the list could come before the time The Senate President however ruled Akpabio out of order Making further clarifications later on the much expected list to journalists the Chairman Senate’ Ad Hoc Committee on Media and Publicity Dino Melaye APC Kogi West said the news making the rounds that the list has been received by the Senate President was untrue “As far as the Senate is concerned the much expected ministerial list has not been received ” he said He however added that the list will definitely be received by the Senate President Bukola Saraki before the next Senate ‘s plenary session next week Tuesday and will be thoroughly and expeditiously considered “We want to announce that we are still waiting for the ministerial list from Mr president and I want to advise that their is no need for agitation as September expires by 12 mid night today “We want to assure Nigeria that as soon as we get possession of this list we will communicate same to Nigerians through the National assembly press Corp “Once again we want to reassure Nigeria again that we will attend to the ministerial nominees expeditiously but diligently “Due process will be followed and I repeat that it is not going to be business as usual we are going to properly screen all nominees and only those who meet the constitutional and moral requirements shall be cleared” he said
96,"Last night's episode of Celebrity Big Brother saw housemate Daniel O'Reilly evicted in a surprise eviction, leaving the remaining housemates breathing a sigh of relief - particularly Farrah Abraham. The American reality TV star has been at the centre of controversy since she entered the house, with viewers and fellow housemates alike accusing her of aggressive behaviour and bullying. However, with O'Reilly gone and tensions eased in the house, some are wondering if Celebrity Big Brother went too far in allowing the seemingly targeted eviction to take place. Farrah has been a controversial figure in the house from the start, regularly clashing with her fellow contestants and displaying a confrontational attitude. Her behaviour has led to a number of arguments and disputes, with many of the other housemates (notably former Atomic Kitten member Natasha Hamilton) expressing their discomfort and dissatisfaction towards Farrah's conduct. However, it was Daniel O'Reilly who appeared to bear the brunt of Farrah's aggression, with the comedian and actor clashing with the American over a number of incidents throughout their time in the house. Despite O'Reilly's attempts to defuse the situation, tensions continued to mount between the two, leading to the seemingly targeted eviction of the comedian on last night's episode. While some may argue that O'Reilly's eviction was justified due to his own questionable behaviour in the house, others are questioning whether Celebrity Big Brother is now actively promoting the bullying and victimisation of contestants for the sake of entertainment. This has been a long-standing issue with the show, with many accusing the producers of promoting a toxic environment that encourages bullying and aggression. The question now is whether or not the eviction of Daniel O'Reilly was a step too far. While it may have relieved some of the tension in the house and allowed Farrah to continue her stay without further conflict, there are those who believe that allowing targeted evictions sends the wrong message to viewers and further promotes the idea that bullying and aggression are acceptable forms of behaviour. It is important to note that Celebrity Big Brother is a reality TV show, and as such, it is designed to create drama and tension for the purpose of entertainment. However, there is a difference between healthy competition and promoting a toxic environment. While viewers may have enjoyed the conflict between Farrah and O'Reilly, it is important to question whether or not this kind of behaviour is something that we should be promoting and normalising in our society. At the end of the day, Celebrity Big Brother will do what it takes to keep viewers entertained and engaged. However, it is important that we, as viewers, question what kind of messages we are sending and whether or not we want to be contributing to a culture of bullying and aggression. While the eviction of Daniel O'Reilly may have provided a momentary reprieve for Farrah Abraham and the other housemates, we must ask ourselves if it was worth the cost of promoting a toxic environment for the sake of entertainment.","It was eviction day on Big Brother.

I hate/love them all! #evictionnight #UKvsUSA — Lorraine (@lorrainemaden) September 4, 2015 But before we got to the eviction, we had to suffer through some more shouting. Big Brother set up a high tea, in which some of the American “servants” were given the task of making the British “royals” angry – leading to one of the most hateful segments of a TV show ever seen. With Farrah in attendance, there was never any doubt they would succeed. She was throwing around some vile and idiotic insults at anyone and everyone – “retard” and “gay homo” were among the highlights. Farrah overstepped the mark!

98,"College Choice has recently released its 2016 ranking of Northern Regional Universities. The unique college rankings are based exclusively on factors that entering freshmen consider to be the most important when making a college decision. According to College Choice, the rankings are intended to help students find the right university that fits their individual needs. The colleges included in the ranking are located in the northern region of the United States and offer a range of majors and degrees. Topping the list at number one is Villanova University, located in Villanova, Pennsylvania. Known for its strong academic programs and successful sports teams, the university also boasts a beautiful campus and a strong sense of community. Coming in at number two is St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York. The liberal arts college is known for its small classes and personalized attention to students. The university is also situated in a stunning location and offers ample opportunities for outdoor recreation. Other colleges in the top ten include SUNY Geneseo in Geneseo, New York, Fairfield University in Fairfield, Connecticut, and Providence College in Providence, Rhode Island. The rankings are based on several factors that College Choice determined were most important to incoming freshmen. These factors include academic reputation, financial aid options, campus location, and campus culture. In addition to traditional factors, College Choice also included a unique metric in its rankings: the percentage of students who return for their sophomore year. According to the rankings, this metric is a strong indicator of student satisfaction and overall success at the university. College Choice encourages students and parents to use the rankings as a tool in their college search process, but also emphasizes the importance of visiting campuses, discussing financial aid options, and speaking with current students and alumni. Overall, the 2016 rankings offer a comprehensive look at some of the top universities in the northern region of the United States. With a focus on factors that are most important to students, the rankings can be a helpful starting point for those embarking on the college search process.","SOURCE College Choice RALEIGH, N.C.

99,"As more and more states legalize marijuana for both medical and recreational use, entrepreneurs are rushing to get in on the ground floor of what many are calling the ""Green Rush."" This has resulted in a huge increase in the number of marijuana start-ups, all of which are eager to pitch their dreams to high net worth investors. According to recent reports, marijuana start-ups across the country are actively seeking out wealthy investors to fund their ambitious plans. Many of these start-ups believe that the marijuana industry is poised for huge growth over the next few years, with some analysts predicting that it could become a $50 billion industry by 2026. To capitalize on this potential growth, marijuana start-ups are seeking funding to expand their operations, develop new products, and innovate new ways to consume marijuana. However, with marijuana still federally illegal in the United States, most banks and traditional lenders are unwilling to work with these companies, leaving them few options for financing. This has led many start-ups to turn to high net worth individuals, who can offer the funding they need to get their businesses off the ground. High net worth investors, on the other hand, are attracted to the marijuana industry for a variety of reasons. Some see it as a lucrative investment opportunity, while others are drawn to the social impact that legalizing marijuana can have on communities. Still, others are motivated by the potential for medical breakthroughs that marijuana research could uncover. One such investor is John, a high net worth individual from New York who has invested in several marijuana start-ups. He believes that the industry is ripe for disruption and views it as an opportunity to help people. ""I got into the marijuana industry because I see it as a way to create a paradigm shift in how we approach health and wellness,"" John said. ""I've invested in several start-ups that are focused on developing new strains of marijuana that can treat specific ailments or diseases. I believe that this kind of research could lead to groundbreaking medical breakthroughs that will benefit millions of people."" As more and more states legalize marijuana, the demand for products and services related to the industry is sure to grow. Marijuana start-ups, therefore, are eager to secure funding now, while the industry is still relatively new and untapped. However, this also means that competition among start-ups seeking funding is fierce, with only the most promising and innovative businesses able to attract investors. For many start-ups, a strong pitch is key to securing funding from high net worth individuals. This means developing a clear and compelling business plan, outlining a viable growth strategy, and demonstrating that the team has the necessary expertise to succeed. Start-ups also need to be able to articulate their unique value proposition and explain why their products or services are different from those of their competitors. One example of a company that has successfully secured funding from high net worth investors is Leafly, a Seattle-based start-up that bills itself as the ""Yelp for marijuana."" The company has developed a mobile app that helps users find and review different marijuana strains and products. So far, the company has raised over $15 million in funding, including contributions from high net worth investors such as Peter Thiel. According to Leafly CEO Paul Campbell, a strong pitch was key to securing funding from Thiel, who is known for his investments in companies such as Facebook and Airbnb. ""We had a really strong pitch, and that's what attracted Peter Thiel to invest in our company,"" Campbell said. ""We were able to articulate our vision for the future of the marijuana industry and show that we had the team and expertise to make it a reality. We're incredibly grateful for his support and the support of all of our investors."" As the marijuana industry continues to grow, there will likely be even more opportunities for start-ups to pitch their dreams to high net worth investors. However, only the most promising and innovative companies will be able to secure funding in this highly competitive market. Those that succeed will be well-positioned to take advantage of the huge potential for growth in the marijuana industry over the next few years.","On the heels of Willie Nelson's cannabis brand getting serious investment, Snoop Dogg launching a cannabis media empire with venture money, and the impending prospect of new California cannabis regulations, more than 200 high net worth investors from around the world are eager to invest in the fastest growing industry in America will gather in Los Angeles, CA at the ArcView Investor Forum.

100,"Dental Fix RX, a leading mobile dental equipment repair service franchise, has recently announced its support for National Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October. This announcement was made through a press release, which outlines how the company's franchisees across the United States will participate in the campaign. The initiative is part of an effort to raise awareness about breast cancer and encourage women to take preventative measures. ""We are committed to supporting this cause and take this opportunity to encourage women to take responsibility for their breast health"", said David Lopez, CEO of Dental Fix RX. Dental Fix RX franchisees will be showing support for the cause in different ways. This includes spreading awareness about the importance of mammograms as detection, attending fundraising events, conducting community outreach initiatives, and even turning the company's iconic logo pink in support of the cause. One of the franchisees, Dr. David Janash of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, shared his enthusiasm for the campaign. ""We are excited to take part in this initiative and support the fight against breast cancer. Our team will be participating in fundraising activities and spreading awareness in our community"", he said. The support of Dental Fix RX franchisees for National Breast Cancer Awareness Month is particularly significant given that breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the United States. Approximately one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime, and early detection can save lives. The company's support for National Breast Cancer Awareness Month is not new, as Dental Fix RX has supported the cause for several years. However, the franchisee support this year is particularly meaningful as the COVID-19 pandemic has brought attention and funds away from other medical causes. ""We believe this is an important initiative for every dental practice and team to support. We want to help make sure women are aware of how they can help prevent breast cancer and how early detection can save lives"", concluded Lopez. Overall, Dental Fix RX's franchisees' support for National Breast Cancer Awareness Month is a powerful reminder of the importance of community involvement in medical issues. The franchisees' actions demonstrate the impact that businesses can have when they prioritize social responsibility, particularly regarding promoting health and fighting disease.","Mobile dental repair franchise kicks off national charity program to support breast cancer research DAVIE, Fla. (PRWEB) September 22, 2015 In observance of Breast Cancer Awareness month, Dental Fix RX, a mobile dental equipment repair company, will be collecting donations throughout the month of October to benefit breast cancer research. The fundraising program encourages franchise owner/operators across North America to give back and support charities by gathering contributions from dental customers and through personal donations. A percentage of the total earned will also be matched by Dental Fix’s corporate office in Florida. “Breast cancer has personally affected several of us at Dental Fix, and we’re honored to launch this program to help find a cure,” said David Lopez, CEO of Dental Fix RX. “Our participating owners will continue their work during October, but with pink shirts, branded bracelets, and promotional materials to gather donations and better inform their dental customers just how important breast cancer research is.” Donors will be given pink branded bracelets and printed collateral highlighting the importance of their contributions.

101,"Three individuals were left injured after a weekend accident that occurred on Saturday evening in downtown Cedar Rapids. According to local authorities, the accident happened at the intersection of 1st and 2nd Avenue around 9 p.m. The accident involved two vehicles, a black sedan, and a white pickup truck. Witnesses at the scene say that the pickup truck was seen running a red light before colliding with the sedan, causing both vehicles to spin out of control. The three individuals who were injured were in the sedan at the time of the accident. All three were transported to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The driver of the pickup truck was not injured in the accident and remained at the scene to speak with authorities. The intersection where the accident occurred was closed for several hours while authorities worked to clear up the wreckage and investigate the cause of the accident.

According to Reuters, the boy was holding a gun when he attempted to take a picture and accidentally pulled the trigger. The incident happened in Houston, Texas, and the teenager was rushed to hospital where he later died from his injuries. It is unclear how the teenager obtained the gun or why he was taking a selfie with it. This serves as a tragic reminder of the importance of gun safety and the potential dangers of social media.

104,"In a surprising move, it has been announced that President of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Shehbaz Sharif, will not lead the party's poll campaign for the upcoming elections. This announcement was made by a party spokesman on Monday. The spokesman, Marriyum Aurangzeb, stated that Shehbaz Sharif has decided not to lead the campaign due to health reasons. He said that Shehbaz Sharif is currently undergoing medical treatment and needs to focus on his recovery. The decision has left many party members shocked as Shehbaz Sharif was seen as the natural choice to lead the campaign. He is a seasoned campaigner and has led the party to victory in previous elections. However, the spokesman assured that the PML-N is still fully prepared for the upcoming polls. The PML-N has faced a number of challenges in the lead up to the elections. In addition to the health concerns of their leader, they have also had to contend with the disqualification of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. The party has also been accused of being involved in corruption scandals and misusing public funds. Despite these challenges, the party remains confident in their chances of victory. They have been actively campaigning across the country, with former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif addressing rallies and events. The spokesman stated that the party will announce a new leader for the campaign soon. He also requested that the media respect the privacy of Shehbaz Sharif and his family during this time. The PML-N is one of the major political parties in Pakistan and has traditionally been popular in the Punjab province. They have a strong support base in the region but will face tough competition from rival parties, including the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) led by cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan. With the elections just around the corner, it remains to be seen who will lead the PML-N campaign. However, the party remains optimistic about their chances and is determined to win back power. The PML-N has a history of strong performances in elections and will be looking to continue that trend in the upcoming polls. In conclusion, the announcement that Shehbaz Sharif will not be leading the PML-N's campaign is a setback for the party. However, they remain determined to win and are confident in their ability to secure victory in the upcoming polls. The decision to announce a new leader is expected soon, and the party is preparing to give it their all in the final stretch of the campaign.","ISLAMABAD: The Presidency clarified on Wednesday that President Mamnoon Hussain had no intention to lead the PML-N campaign for local government elections in Sindh. “President Mamnoon Hussain, as a symbol of the federation, is above politics and has no political motives,” the president’s spokesman said, rejecting the PPP’s objection to his participation in a PML-N meeting despite a ban on his taking part in political activities by the court. According to a press release issued by the PM Office on Monday, Prime Minister Sharif and President Hussain co-chaired a meeting of the PML-N Sindh office-bearers held at the Prime Minister’s House. The party’s Sindh general secretary briefed the president and the prime minister on the district committees set up in all 29 districts of the province to launch mass contact campaigns, it said. The PPP, whose Co-Chairman Asif Ali Zardari had been criticised for holding dual offices and convening meetings of the party at the Presidency, said it wondered how President Hussain could chair a political meeting of the ruling party. “The PPP is surprised that unlike former president Asif Zardari, the incumbent president is no longer restrained by the court order from participating in partisan political meetings,” PPP’s spokesman Farhatullah Babar said in a statement on Tuesday. But the president’s spokesman said: “There is no truth in the reports that the president will lead the PML-N campaign for the local bodies’ elections in Sindh.” The spokesman said in statement that in the past President Hussain had for long been active in politics in Sindh and had wide connections with the provincial leadership and workers due to which a large number of political workers remained desirous of meeting him in their individual capacity. “Recently, when office-bearers of Sindh PML-N came to Islamabad they expressed their desire to meet the president on a personal and social basis upon which Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif personally requested the president to informally visit the PM House and meet his former colleagues,” the spokesman said. “There were no political motives of the president behind that meeting,” he added. The Lahore High Court had on May 12, 2011, ruled that (then) President Asif Zardari should relinquish the post of PPP co-chairman and the Presidency should not be used for political activities. “The use of Presidency for political activity is inconsistent with its sanctity, dignity, neutrality and independence. Therefore, it is expected that the president of Pakistan would cease the use of the premises of Presidency for political meetings of his party,” the four-judge bench of the LHC had said in its order on a petition filed by senior lawyer A.K. Dogar on behalf of the Pakistan Lawyers Forum challenging the holding of political office by Mr Zardari. Published in Dawn, September 24th, 2015 On a mobile phone? Get the Dawn"
105,"In today's global economy, expanding companies are focused on increasing their reach in overseas markets. However, it is essential for such companies to consider the potential risks that come with operating in different regions abroad. Failure to assess such risks can have significant financial and reputational implications for companies. Overseas operations can expose companies to a wide range of risks, including political instability, economic uncertainty, currency fluctuations, regulatory changes, and cultural differences. To ensure that these risks are identified and addressed, expanding companies must conduct thorough due diligence before entering foreign markets. One area of concern for expanding companies is the potential impact of political instability or changes in government policies on their operations. For instance, sudden changes in foreign policies, imposition of trade tariffs or economic sanctions, or security risks posed by conflict or terrorism can severely disrupt business operations. Expanding companies must pay close attention to geopolitical risks in the markets they plan to enter to minimize potential losses. Another significant risk that expanding companies face is economic uncertainty. Emerging markets, for instance, tend to be volatile and prone to currency fluctuations, which can affect the profitability of foreign investments. Expanding companies must therefore assess macroeconomic risks such as inflation, exchange rate risks and regulatory risks, that could affect operations in the markets they plan to enter. Cultural differences between home and host countries also pose a threat to the success of overseas operations of expanding companies. Expanding companies must take time to study the culture and social norms of the host country. Understanding local business practices, customs, and systems is imperative in establishing credibility and trust with host country businesses and authorities. It is also worth noting that regulatory standards may vary from country to country, and foreign companies may be faced with unfamiliar regulations or cultural practices that can impact organizational performance. Expanding companies, therefore, must do their homework, researching regulations and compliance requirements specific to each market they plan to enter. In conclusion, expanding companies should take every precaution when considering operating offshore as they will be exposed to risks that may have negative outcomes both financially and otherwise. Thorough due diligence, risk identification, and management, as well as cultural awareness, can give the company a positive outcome. It is essential to plan and research, and any discovering of potential risks can be avoided with sound contingency planning.","Many organizations are seeking to expand their operations overseas as part of their growth strategies. In Bahrain, as well as around the world, globalization has entered a new phase, posing greater challenges for anti-bribery and corruption (ABC) compliance than ever before. Two factors are creating new issues for companies, according to a recent report by KPMG International. First, a growing number of governments around the world are tightening ABC regulations or introducing new ones as we see in Bahrain. In the light of Kingdom’s expanding corporate culture, the government has introduced Law Number 01/2013 to expand the Amiri Decree Number 15/1976, in order to address bribery and corruption across both the public and private sectors. Second, as companies globalize their operations, they rely more heavily on third parties than before to do business in far-flung parts of the world, often in areas where there is a high risk of corruption. said: “the government has worked hard to enforce strict laws on bribery and corruption. However, as the global report highlights, with GCC based organizations and businesses increasingly investing overseas, reliance on and managing risk with third parties can be a challenge and adequate controls and monitoring must be put in place.” The survey, conducted by KPMG International with respondents from around the world, shows that companies are rising to the challenge but that a great deal more needs to be done to create a sturdy ABC compliance structure. For full details, read the report . The main findings of the survey include: “Despite greater efforts to build ABC frameworks, it’s clear that there are gaping holes in them,” says Petrus Marais, Global Leader of Forensic Services for KPMG. “The problem is particularly acute in the management of third parties who increasingly act as conduits for bribes, making it harder to track. Respondents to the survey admit it’s the biggest challenge in the field of ABC, but they are not doing enough to develop a culture of compliance both among their employees and their vendors and other business associates.” About the survey The survey targeted 659 respondents covering 64 countries, with 140 respondents based in Central & Eastern Europe (including Russia), 113 in Western European countries (excluding the UK), 105 from the Asia – Pacific region, 66 respondents in the U.S., 64 from the South American continent (31 in Mexico), 61 in South Africa and 41 in the UK. Industries were widely represented: banking comprised 20 percent, life sciences 12 percent, manufacturing 10 percent and energy & natural resources 8 percent. The survey was completed in October 2"
106,"Singapore's ruling party, the People's Action Party (PAP), is set to return to power after winning the country's general elections with a landslide victory. The PAP, led by incumbent Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, won 83 out of 93 parliamentary seats, an increase from their previous score of 69 out of 89 seats in the last elections. The opposition parties, comprising the Worker's Party, the Progress Singapore Party, and the Singapore Democratic Party, won only 10 seats in total. Despite some improvements in their performance compared to the previous elections, the overall outcome was a resounding victory for the PAP. This election was held amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and the PAP campaigned on their track record of successfully managing the crisis and their plans for Singapore's economic recovery. They vowed to create more jobs, provide better healthcare, and enhance the country's resilience to future crises. In his victory speech, Prime Minister Lee thanked the voters for their support and promised to continue working for the betterment of the country. He acknowledged the challenges ahead, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and Singapore's relations with its neighbors, but expressed confidence in the country's ability to overcome these challenges. The PAP has been in power since Singapore's independence in 1965 and has won every general election since then. This latest victory ensures that they will continue to govern the country for the foreseeable future.","Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his wife Ho Ching leave a polling station after casting their votes in Singapore (Photo: AFP) Singapore’s ruling People’s Action Party of Premier Lee Hsien Loong is set to return to power with absolute majority in the fiercely contested general election, dashing hopes of an emboldened Opposition seeking to end half a century dominance of one-party. Three People’s Action Party (PAP) candidates have been declared winners and a sample count of the all votes indicated that seven of the eight Opposition parties are unlikely to win a seat in Parliament, the Channel News Asia reported. PAP candidates Cheryl Chan, Grace Fu and Lam Pin Min have won their respective seat from Fenghan, Yuhua and Sengkang West constituencies. “The sample count results have been really encouraging across the island, but we don’t want to take them for granted, just as we should never take our residents for granted,” PAP candidate Tan Chuan-Jin was quoted as saying. Opposition leaders have acknowledged the sample count results, saying there seems to a bigger swing towards the PAP, which has ruled Singapore for 50 years since independence.More than 2 million Singaporeans voted today in one of the biggest general election contest."

108,"Target is taking price-matching to the next level with their latest move in the retail industry. The company has announced that they will now match prices for select online retailers, including Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and others. This move aims to give customers the confidence that they are getting the best price on their purchases while shopping at Target. Starting this week, Target will match prices for items sold and shipped by Walmart.com, Amazon.com, BestBuy.com, and hundreds of other online retailers. This comes on top of their existing price-matching policy which allows customers to match prices from local competitors, as well as their own website. Target will also extend the time frame for price matching from 14 days to 30 days. This decision was made in response to customers’ desire for greater transparency and value for their money, especially during the holiday shopping season. Target's Chief Merchandising Officer, Mark Tritton stated, ""We want guests to know they can trust us for competitive prices while they're shopping conveniently on Target.com, and also feel confident that they're getting a great deal.” To take advantage of this program, customers can simply bring in proof of the lower price, whether it is in-store or online, and request a price match at any Target store or contact the Target customer service team. This move is just one of the ways that Target is working to stay competitive in the industry and provide customers with the shopping experience they are looking for. With this new price-matching policy, Target is hoping to continue to see growth in sales and customer satisfaction.","A Target store built on land where the notorious Cabrini-Green housing project once stood is shown on October 10, 2013 in Chicago, Illinois. Target is in it to win it this holiday season as the retail giant rolled out a brand new price-match policy Wednesday that promises to go as low as the prices at any of its 29 largest competitors – online or in-store. Beginning Oct. 1, Target customers will be able to match the price of purchases made in-store or on Target.com, and they’ll also have a longer timeframe to do so. Previously the Minneapolis-based corporation had a limited price-match policy , only allowing shoppers to get the lowest price matched from a small handful of retailers for items bought in-person, forcing customers to go from store to store to find the best deal. They also only had 7 days to do so. The updated policy doubles that time frame, allowing two full weeks for shoppers to get a price adjustment and allowing customers to search online or from their smartphone to do so. Target also added 24 additional rival retailers to the expanded policy, including for the first time stores with memberships such as Costco and Sam’s Club.

109,"WallachBeth, leading provider of institutional execution services and independent research, has maintained its target price of $134 on Clovis Oncology Inc. (NASDAQ:CLVS) and its “buy” rating, according to a research note issued to investors on Monday. The research firm's reiteration of its bullish stance on Clovis Oncology followed reports that the company’s drug Rubraca had been granted priority review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its supplemental new drug application. The new application seeks to expand the use of the drug in the treatment of prostate cancer. Rubraca, a drug that has been on the market since 2016 for the treatment of ovarian cancer, has been found to be effective in inhibiting DNA damage repair pathways in cancer cells, leading to their destruction. The drug has been successful in clinical trials, leading to the FDA granting the drug accelerated approval. Its success has prompted the company to seek approval for use in more cancers. WallachBeth stated in its research report that the recent news was a significant development for the firm, and the reiteration of its “buy” rating on Clovis Oncology represented an opportunity for investors to capitalize on the company’s strong growth prospects. ""Our thesis on CLVS remains unchanged with a continued positive outlook for the company,"" said a WallachBeth representative. ""We believe that the recent priority designation for Rubraca for prostate cancer reinforces our bullish view on the company and we maintain our price target at $134."" Clovis Oncology Inc. has been on an impressive run this year, with its shares surging by more than 60% in the year to date. The company's shares rose by over 5% in the trading session following the announcement of the priority review for Rubraca. With the new drug application being granted priority review, the FDA has set a target action date of May 15, 2021, which is earlier than the standard review period of ten months. Clovis Oncology CEO Patrick Mahaffy commented on the news, stating: ""We believe the addition of prostate cancer to the Rubraca label could potentially double the number of patients with advanced prostate cancer who may benefit from treatment with Rubraca."" The expansion of Rubraca is set to strengthen Clovis Oncology's position in the oncology drug market, which is projected to grow significantly in the coming years. According to a report released by Grand View Research, the global oncology market is expected to reach $220.6 billion by 2026, driven by factors such as an increase in the incidence of cancer and advancements in cancer treatment technologies. The news of the priority review for Rubraca has further bolstered the company’s outlook and strengthened its growth prospects.

110,"Replimune Ltd, a biotechnology firm based in Woburn, Massachusetts, has raised $30 million in a Series A financing round. The funding was led by Atlas Venture and co-led by Forbion and Arix Bioscience. Replimune focuses on the development of oncolytic immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. The company's lead product candidate is RP1, a genetically modified herpes simplex virus type 1 that selectively replicates in and destroys cancer cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed. RP1 is in Phase 1/2 clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumors, including melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. The funds raised in this financing round will be used to advance the clinical development of RP1 and to expand Replimune's pipeline of oncolytic immunotherapies. The company also plans to establish a new research and development facility in the Greater Boston area. ""We are excited to have the support of such strong investors as we continue to progress our innovative immunotherapy pipeline,"" said Philip Astley-Sparke, CEO of Replimune. ""This financing will enable us to further develop RP1 and accelerate the discovery and development of additional oncolytic immunotherapies."" With this new funding, Replimune has raised a total of $46 million to date. The company previously raised $16 million in seed funding in 2016, which was also led by Atlas Venture and included participation from sector-focused investors like AbbVie Ventures, GlaxoSmithKline's SR One, and Transatlantic Fund. ""We are impressed by the team's track record in developing oncolytic immunotherapies and look forward to seeing the continued progress of RP1 through clinical development,"" said Bruce Booth, Ph.D., partner at Atlas Venture. ""Replimune's innovative approach to immuno-oncology has the potential to make a significant impact in the treatment of cancer."" Oncolytic immunotherapies, which use viruses to attack cancer cells, have emerged as a promising new approach to cancer treatment in recent years. Replimune's RP1 is one of several oncolytic viruses currently undergoing clinical trials, and it has shown promising results in early-stage studies. With this new funding in place, Replimune is well-positioned to continue developing its pipeline of oncolytic immunotherapies and bring new treatment options to patients with cancer in the future.","/PRNewswire/ -- Atlas Venture leads Series A, joining existing seed investors Omega Funds and Forbion Capital Partners Replimune Ltd (Replimune) today announced the closing of a $30 million Series A financing led by Atlas Venture (Atlas). Atlas joins previous seed investors Forbion Capital Partners (Forbion) and Omega Funds (Omega) as investors in this funding round. Replimune, headquartered in Oxford UK and with a significant presence in Cambridge, MA, was founded in April 2015 to develop the next generation of 'oncolytic immunotherapies' for the treatment of cancer. Jason Rhodes, Partner at Atlas, will join the board of Replimune together with Otello Stampacchia and Sander Slootweg of Omega and Forbion, respectively. Oncolytic immunotherapy is an emerging class of cancer therapeutics which exploit the ability of viruses to selectively replicate in and kill tumor tissue, while at the same time inducing a potent, patient-specific, anti-tumor immune response. Oncolytic viruses have the unique ability to generate an autologous immune response to the patient's particular complement of tumor antigens, including neoantigens, with a truly off-the-shelf approach. While clear single agent clinical activity has been achieved with oncolytic immunotherapy, it is anticipated that particular synergy may be observed in combination with immune checkpoint blockade and other immune-modulatory approaches. Immune checkpoint blockade relies on a pre-existing inflamed tumor microenvironment and a pre-existing immune response to tumor neoantigens for clinical activity, which are only present in some patients. Oncolytic immunotherapy can provide both of these and therefore combination of these two proven modalities is particularly logical and attractive. Replimune is developing novel, proprietary oncolytic immunotherapies intended to improve both the direct anti-tumor effects of selective virus replication and the potency of the immune response to the tumor antigens released. Replimune intends to progress these rapidly through clinical trials and to combine these with checkpoint blockade at an early stage of clinical development.

111,"Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has won the elections and announced that he will form a coalition government with his former partner, the Independent Greeks party. The coalition was previously in power between 2015 and 2019, before the Independent Greeks left the government due to disputes over the Macedonia name deal. With 99 percent of votes counted, Tsipras’ leftist Syriza party was in first place with 31.5 percent, while the conservative New Democracy party had 39.8 percent. However, since Greece’s parliament has 300 seats, a party needs at least 151 seats to secure an outright majority. Thus, a coalition with the Independent Greeks, who have 10 seats in parliament, is crucial. The Syriza party has been in power since 2015 and has faced numerous challenges during its tenure, including a crippling economic crisis and tensions with neighboring Turkey. However, Tsipras has managed to steer Greece towards recovery, with the country exiting the bailout program last year. In his victory speech, Tsipras said, “We have achieved important things… but many more challenges still lie ahead. We will continue to work hard to ensure a fairer country with more opportunities for all.” The Independent Greeks party has been a close ally of Tsipras in the past, but it remains to be seen if they will be able to work together smoothly once again. However, both parties have stated that they share similar goals, including the need to reduce austerity measures and boost economic growth. The coalition will need to address a number of pressing issues, including improving the country’s health and education systems, implementing the Macedonia name deal, and tackling the ongoing refugee crisis. It remains to be seen how Tsipras and his coalition government will tackle these challenges, but they have promised to work hard to build a better future for Greece.",", EDT. An elderly man enters an election booth to cast his vote at a polling station in Idomeni village, northern Greece, Sunday, Sept. 20, 2015. The small village of 100 registered voters is the last stop in Greece for thousands migrants and refugees arriving from Turkey who attempt to cross and head north toward more prosperous parts of the European Union. Greeks were voting Sunday in their third national poll this year, called on to choose who they trust to steer the country into its new international bailout. (AP Photo/Giannis Papanikos)"" ATHENS, Greece - Alexis Tsipras, head of the left-wing Syriza party who won Greece's parliamentary election for the second time this year on Sunday, says he will form a coalition government with the small right-wing Independent Greeks. Speaking before thousands of jubilant supporters in central Athens, Tsipras said he was joining forces once again with Panos Kammenos, the junior coalition partner with whom he governed from January until last month. Kammenos joined him on stage to rapturous applause from the crowd. With 61 per cent of the vote counted, Syriza had 35.5 per cent of the vote and 145 seats in the 300-member parliament, while the Independent Greeks were in seventh place with 3.6 per cent and 10 seats. The conservative New Democracy was in second place with 28.2 per cent. The result was a resounding success for Tsipras' high-risk gamble when he resigned last month and triggered early elections, barely seven months into his four-year term, in order to face down a rebellion within Syriza over his policy U-turn to accept painful austerity measures in return for Greece's third international bailout.

113,"The Canberra Capitals, one of the leading teams in Australian Women's National Basketball League (WNBL), are set to make a bold move to secure the reigning WNBL Player of the Year, Abby Bishop. The star forward had previously played for the team between 2009 and 2014, leading them to two championships during her tenure. According to sources close to the team, the Capitals have been in talks with Bishop for several weeks, and are said to be close to reaching a deal that would see her return to the team she once led to greatness. Bishop is currently the captain of the Adelaide Lightning, and was instrumental in leading the team to the WNBL Grand Final last season, where they narrowly lost to the Melbourne Boomers. Her impressive performances throughout the season saw her named the WNBL Player of the Year, as well as earning a spot on the All-WNBL First Team. The addition of Bishop to the Capitals' already impressive squad would be a major coup for the team, and would likely make them one of the favorites to win the WNBL championship this season. With her ability to score from anywhere on the court, as well as her leadership skills and experience, Bishop would add a new dimension to the team's offense and defense. The Capitals, who are currently coached by Paul Goriss, know the importance of having a strong team chemistry and have built their roster around a mix of experienced players and emerging talents. The likes of Olivia Epoupa, Kelsey Griffin, and Marianna Tolo make up a formidable starting five, and adding Bishop to the mix would only strengthen their already impressive lineup. Speaking about the potential signing, Goriss said, ""We know what Abby is capable of as a player, having won championships here before, and her recent performances speak for themselves. She's a versatile player who can play in multiple positions and will bring some much-needed experience to our team. If we can secure her services, it would be a huge boost for us."" Bishop, who has played for the Opals, the Australian national team, and is considered one of the best players in the WNBL, has yet to comment publicly on the rumors surrounding her potential return to the Capitals. However, if the deal is finalized, it would mark a dream return for the player, and could cement her legacy as one of the greatest players to ever grace the WNBL. Fans of the team and the league as a whole will eagerly await news of the deal, with the WNBL season set to start in early November. Whether or not the Capitals are able to sign Bishop, it's clear that they will be a major player in the league this season, and will be looking to add to their impressive trophy cabinet.","The Canberra Capitals are poised to re-sign reigning WNBL player of the year Abby Bishop in a massive boost to the club's hopes of ending a four-year finals drought. The Canberra Capitals are poised to re-sign reigning WNBL player of the year Abby Bishop in a massive boost to the club's hopes of ending a four-year finals drought. Bishop has been granted a release from her contract with Hungarian club UNIQA Sopron, and the Capitals are deep in discussions with their incumbent captain. The 26-year-old picked up a minor hamstring injury playing for Seattle Storm and was due to head to Hungary next week, but Bishop and Sopron have come to a mutual agreement. It is understood the Capitals hope to make an official announcement as early as this week. Bishop dominated the WNBL last year, averaging 23 points and 10.6 rebounds, and was a clear winner of the player of the year. The Capitals are very confident Bishop's injury isn't a risk and she will get through the full season. Just a few weeks ago the Capitals' roster was severely depleted, but they now look very much a finals contender after recruiting shrewdly since. Bishop's recruitment helps ease the Capitals' concerns in the post, as they had been struggling to find a quality replacement after Belgian centre Ann Wauters withdrew late due to family reasons. Star centre Lauren Jackson, herself returning from knee surgery, is the only specialist post player Canberra currently has on its books. But if both stay fit, Jackson and Bishop will from arguably the most imposing front court partnership in the WNBL. Jackson's rehabilitation is progressing well and she plans to be back on court early in the season. Opals point guard Kathleen MacLeod also pulled out after falling pregnant, but the Capitals compensated by signing former WNBA All-Star Renee Montgomery last week. Montgomery's Minnesota Lynx has qualified for the WNBA Finals after disposing of Phoenix in the western conference finals. It means Montgomery will miss at least the season-opener against Dandenong at AIS Arena on October 10, and the week two games at Sydney and Townsville should the WNBA Finals go the full five games. A lack of personnel, particularly in the front court, has forced the Capitals to cancel its pre-season game in Sydney on Saturday. With Jackson, Bishop and Montgomery still absent, just seven contracted players suited up in three games against South-East Queensland last weekend. Hanna Zavecz injured her ribs at training last week and Opals youngster Steph Talbot hit her head on the court against the Stars. The Capitals aren't willing to risk the pair this week before the start of the WNBL season, but both will be fit to play. Meanwhile, the Capitals are yet to finalise a deal which would see the majority of their home games shifted from AIS Arena to the Royal Theatre. However, it is understood the club is confident an agreement will be reached before season tip-off. It is hoped the move into the city to a smaller venue will ensure bigger crowds and a better atmosphere as the Capitals shoot for a first finals appearance since 2010-11. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald."

According to the report, as of the end of June, the country's foreign reserves stood at USD159.027 billion, down from USD160.219 billion at the end of May. This marks a decline of 0.75% in just one month. The drop is mainly attributed to the increase in imports during the month of June, which exceeded the country's exports. While this decline in foreign reserves is not alarming, it is still noteworthy, especially since the country's economic recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic has been somewhat sluggish. This decrease in foreign reserves raises concerns about the country's ability to maintain its foreign currency reserves at a satisfactory level, particularly in the current global economic climate, which is characterized by uncertainty and volatility. Despite this decline, the stock exchange remains optimistic, noting that the country's economy is expected to recover in the coming months, which should lead to an increase in foreign reserves and boost investor confidence.","Algeria's foreign-exchange reserves have continued their downward trend to stand at USD159.027 billion by late June 2015, against USD178.938 billion in late December 2014, the governor of the Bank of Algeria, Mohamed Laksaci, disclosed on Tuesday.

The pharmacy giant confirmed the news on Friday. According to a statement released by CVS, the hack was discovered ""recently"" during routine maintenance. The statement clarified that the CVS.com website was not affected, only the photo site, which has since been shut down. The statement also noted that the vulnerability exploited in the hack has been fixed, and that there is no evidence that the hackers were able to access customers' credit card information or any other sensitive medical information. ""We take the protection of our customers' information seriously, and we have engaged outside experts to assist us in conducting a thorough investigation,"" CVS said in the statement. The company is advising users of the photo site to change their passwords, and to monitor their credit reports and accounts for any suspicious activity. CVS says it is notifying affected users by email and is offering them a year of identity theft protection and credit monitoring services for free. This is not the first time that CVS has experienced a security breach. In 2014, the company's website was hacked, exposing the personal information of nearly 7,000 customers. The latest hack underscores the need for companies to take proactive measures to protect their customers' information, as cybercrime continues to pose a serious threat to businesses of all sizes.","CVS said Friday investigators have confirmed that the company that manages their photo website was indeed hacked this summer, possibly resulting in the theft of some CVS customer information.

The Trojans (22-2) beat Norman North, Chisholm and NOAH in pool play before advancing and beating Cascia Hall in the semifinals. It’s Jenks’ second straight tournament title, after claiming the Bishop Kelley tournament crown on Sept. 12. “Having two tournament wins feels great, not because of the wins so much as the girls reaching two of their four goals they set early on in the season when we were at team camp,” Jenks coach Tanna Smith said. “I know my girls are excited as they hit milestone after milestone down their road to the state tournament.” Jenks’ win over Edmond Santa Fe atoned for the Trojans’ 3-0 loss to the Wolves on Aug. 21.

The 3A No. 2 Mustangs have turned that inspiration into a 21-6 record with the playoffs fast approaching. Clark also alluded to another reason for success. “Having a court full of good hitters has also helped us,” she said. “We are not dependent on one or two. We can hit from anywhere.” Asked to point to a couple of key contributors, Clark couldn’t help but name nearly everyone on her team — hitters/blockers Karleigh McMahan, Kirstyn Anderson, Summer Milligan and Blake Judkins, setter Jade Hopkins, libero Macy Haley and junior varsity call-up, Emily Taylor. “To ask who is leading the way, I would have to say they all are,” Clark said.

The refinery, which specialises in collecting and reprocessing waste oil into a range of usable products, is currently in discussions with local training providers and government bodies to establish a formal apprenticeship program. ""We believe that investing in apprentices is not only essential for the growth and development of our company, but for the industry as a whole"", said refinery manager Sarah Jones, ""We want to ensure that we are passing on the knowledge and expertise that we have gained over the years, to the next generation of workers"".

121,"Dame Joan Collins has opened up about the emotional moment she urged her younger sister Jackie to get herself checked for breast cancer. Speaking to reporters, the iconic actress revealed that she regularly ""nagged"" Jackie about the importance of taking care of her health, especially as she approached her 50s. It was during one of these conversations that Joan became particularly concerned about her sister's health and urged her to get a mammogram. ""I kept saying to her, 'You have to get checked, Jackie. It's better to know and take care of it than not to know and have it get worse,'"" Dame Joan recalled. ""I was really worried about her."" Thankfully, Jackie did eventually listen to her sister's advice and got tested. The results revealed that she had stage one breast cancer, but thanks to early detection, the cancer was removed and she went on to make a full recovery. Dame Joan has since become an advocate for breast cancer awareness and encourages women of all ages to get regular check-ups. In her interview, she stressed the importance of taking action before it's too late, a message that resonates strongly during Breast Cancer Awareness Month. ""I know so many women who have passed away from cancer or men who have passed away from prostate cancer, and it's a disease that doesn't discriminate,"" she said. ""You have to be vigilant, you have to be aware, and you have to take care of yourself."" Breast cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer in women, with one in eight women in the UK being diagnosed with the disease over their lifetime. However, early detection through regular check-ups can greatly increase the chances of survival and recovery. Dame Joan's experience with her sister is a powerful reminder of the importance of looking after our health and encouraging our loved ones to do the same. As she puts it, ""We need to think about what we put into our bodies, how we exercise, how we live our lives, and encourage our children and grandchildren to do the same. Prevention is the key."" For those who have been diagnosed with breast cancer, Dame Joan's words of encouragement are a reminder that there is always hope. ""As long as you have faith and believe that you can beat it, you will beat it,"" she said. In the end, the message is clear: take care of yourself, take care of each other, and never underestimate the power of early detection and prevention.","Dame Joan Collins said she used to ""nag"" her sister Jackie about getting mammograms but she ""refused"". Jackie, who sold more than 500 million novels in more than 40 countries in her four decades-long career as a writer in raunchy female fiction, died of breast cancer last Saturday aged 77. Joan and Jackie Collins during the filming of the 2013 New Year's Eve Graham Norton Show Dame Joan said she and her sister were ""thick as thieves"" but admitted they did have ""estrangements"" in the past. Despite being diagnosed six-and-a-half years ago, British author Jackie, who lived in Beverley Hills, told few people about her illness, saying she did not want to ''burden'' others with it. In an online post called A Tribute To My Beloved Sister, Dame Joan wrote: ""I used to nag my sister about getting mammograms, as our darling mother Elsa had succumbed to the disease in 1962 when she was only in her early fifties. ""I was religious about doing mammograms regularly. Jackie however refused - she didn't even like going to doctors. Like my brother and I she was needle-phobic."" Dame Joan, who said she and Jackie were "" thick as thieves"", also revealed the moment Jackie rang her to say she had stage four breast cancer. She only found out about her sister's illness in the fortnight before her death. She said Jackie told her that she did not want to upset her, adding that she said: "" I know all the problems you've been having in the past few years - I didn't want to burden you with mine."" Dame Joan wrote: ""My voice was so choked with tears I could hardly speak."" The pair, who had been rumoured at times to have a difficult relationship, were pictured together in London just a few days before the death when Jackie was on a promotional tour for her new novel The Santangelos. In her tribute, Dame Joan wrote: ""Jackie really enjoyed her life so much and lived it to the hilt, and when we were together, even if we hadn't seen each other for a few months, we were thick as thieves."" Dame Joan said Jackie ""hated"" her fourth husband Peter Holm, adding: ""She begged me not to marry him but unfortunately I went ahead - one of the worst decisions of my life. Jackie and I didn't see each other so much during that period."" She went on: ""Unfortunately, a couple of years later another relationship I had came between us and, having moved back to Europe, we couldn't be as close as we wanted to be. ""Sisters will have their estrangements but happily when that relationship ended and I moved back to LA Jackie and I resumed our devotion to each other."" She added: ""I've never had a better girlfriend than Jackie, with whom I shared so much in common and could enjoy talking and gossiping away about everything when we were together, going to our favourite restaurants or to the movies or on long distance phone calls."" In her concluding few lines, Dame Joan said: ""I don't think I will ever recover from the sadness of losing my beautiful baby sister."" She added: ""She will live on in the wonderful memories I have of her from our childhood and particularly from the last fifteen years, during which we were closer than ever. I feel her spirit, I hear her wonderful laugh and I see her all the time in the hundreds of photos of her that are sprinkled around my home. ""She wasn't just a star - to me she was an entire galaxy."" Dame Joan has requested that people who read her online tribute make donations to Penny Brohn Cancer Care in the UK and the Susan G. Komen breast cancer organisation in the USA. Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved."

123,"For those who have followed Hollywood actor Matt Damon's films, one might have noticed that the red planet – Mars – has been a recurring theme in some of his recent projects. But what can we learn from Matt Damon about Mars? Surprisingly, quite a lot. In the 2015 blockbuster hit movie ""The Martian,"" Matt Damon plays the role of Mark Watney, an astronaut stranded on Mars after his crew presumed him dead and left. The movie not only won critical acclaim but also shed light on the possibilities and challenges of exploring the red planet. Here are some key takeaways from Matt Damon's experiences on Mars: 1. Self-sufficiency is key. In ""The Martian,"" Watney realizes that the only way to survive on Mars is to be entirely self-sufficient. He grows his food, makes his water, and repairs his equipment, all while being alone on a desolate planet. In the face of adversity, Watney rises to the challenge and shows that being self-reliant is the key to surviving in such harsh conditions. 2. Innovation and creativity can save lives. While stranded on Mars, Watney has to improvise and come up with creative solutions to survive. For instance, he uses his background in botany to grow potatoes on the planet, which provides him with food that sustains him until help arrives. The same ingenuity applies in real-life space exploration – being innovative and creative can be the difference between life and death. 3. Teamwork is critical. Although Watney is alone for most of his time on Mars, he realizes that he would not have survived without the collective efforts of his team back on Earth. The team at NASA worked tirelessly to bring him home, overcoming insurmountable challenges to ensure his safe return. This shows the importance of teamwork, even in the most individualistic of pursuits. 4. Technology and science drive progress. The movie showcases the immense technological advancements that make Mars exploration possible. From the spacecraft that takes the astronauts to the planet to the high-tech equipment used to grow food, technology and science are the driving force behind progress in space exploration. Matt Damon's portrayal of an astronaut reinforces the idea that space exploration is a collaborative and technologically-driven endeavor. 5. Resilience is key to success. One of the most remarkable things about Watney is his resilience, his ability to persevere and never lose hope, even when the odds were against him. This tenacity, grit and determination are essential traits for any aspiring astronaut or anyone doing anything remotely challenging. In conclusion, Matt Damon's experiences on Mars have a lot to offer us, beyond just being entertaining films. Self-sufficiency, innovation, teamwork, technology, and resilience are all critical factors that can make a difference in space exploration and beyond. These lessons learned from the movies can inspire us as we push the boundaries of what's possible and hopefully one day make Mars a habitable planet for us all.","(CNN) - Matt Damon plays an astronaut stranded in space in his latest movie, and NASA is capitalizing on his star power to promote its future travels to Mars. ""The Martian"" star was tapped for a NASA video about real-life efforts to explore Mars in the latest cross-promotion between the film and the space agency. NASA collaborated on the film with 20th Century Fox Entertainment, providing guidance on production design and technical consultants. For its part, NASA is making the most of its Hollywood connection to educate the public on space exploration and burnish its brand in the process. It even launched a page, ""The Real Martians,"" dedicated to the topic. The film combines fictional and factual narratives about Mars based on work of NASA and others have done. In the film, which takes place in the 2030s, astronauts regularly travel to Mars and live on the surface to explore. ""The Martian"" is set to open October 2. ""Sending people to Mars and returning them safely is the challenge of a generation,"" Damon says in the NASA video. ""Journey to Mars will forever change our history books, rewriting what we know about the red planet and expanding the human presence deeper into the solar system."" For better or worse, it often takes a little Hollywood magic to capture the public's attention, especially when it comes to science. So, how does a mission to Mars play out? Journey to Mars begins on International Space Station Right now, some 250 miles above land on the International Space Station, American astronaut Scott Kelly and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko are studying the effect of long periods without gravity on the human body. The ""One Year Mission"" on the space station will help prepare for future journeys. Kelly led a Twitter chat Saturday, six months into his mission, sharing insights into what they've learned so far. No drop of sweat, coffee or urine goes to waste on the station thanks to the Environmental Control and Life Support System. The system recovers and recycles water from various sources so it can be reclaimed and filtered for consumption through the Water Recovery System. The International Space Station uses a deployable fresh-food production system known as Veggie to build a continuous source of food. Using red, blue, and green lights, Veggie helps plants grow in pillows, small bags with a wicking surface containing media and fertilizer, to be harvested by astronauts. Astronauts used the system to grow red romaine lettuce in 2014 -- a huge step in space farming. Getting there Future trips to Mars could take 500 days or longer so it better be a smooth ride. The vehicle that will bring crews to space is the Orion spacecraft, which will provide emergency abort capability, sustain the crew during the space travel and bring them back safely. Orion will launch on NASA's new heavy-left rocket, the Space Launch System Staying there Although ""The Martian"" takes place 20 years in the future, NASA is already working on many of the technologies that appear in the film. Damon's character, astronaut Mark Watney, spends time in the habitation module known as ""the Hab."" Future astronauts who land on Mars will need such a home to survive. At Johnson Space Center in Houston, crews train for long-duration deep-space missions in the Human Exploration Research Analog known as HERA, a self-contained environment that simulates a deep-space habit. The two-story habitat contains living quarters, workspaces, a hygiene module and a simulated airlock. Crews stay in the habitat for 14 days at a time conducting operational tasks, completing payload objectives and learning how to live together in an isolated environment. In the film, Watney fends for himself with limited supplies after his crew leaves him behind, believing him dead. To pass time, he goes for a spin on his rover, which is based on NASA's Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle. The vehicle has been used in NASA's analog mission projects to troubleshoot and develop capabilities to support missions to an asteroid, Mars, its moons and elsewhere. It's built to handle address issues such as range, rapid entry and exit and radiation protection. Some versions of the vehicle have six pivoting wheels for maneuverability. In the instance of a flat tire, the vehicle simply lifts up the bad wheel and keeps on rolling. Watney spends most of his sol (Martian day) in a spacesuit to protect himself from the cold atmosphere, lack of breathable air and dust. NASA is working on two new prototypes to identify technology gaps between current spacesuits and ones sufficient for setting foot on Mars. Through the Z-2 and Prototype eXploration spacesuits, spacesuit engineers are examining the tradeoff between hard composite materials and fabrics to strike a balance between durability and flexibility."
124,"In a society where menopause is often still seen as a taboo subject, it's important that men understand the emotional effects that this time in a woman's life can bring. Mary Jo Rapini, a renowned therapist, speaker and co-author of the book Re-Coupling: A Couple's 4-Step Guide to Greater Intimacy and Better Sex, has been vocal about the need for men to support their partners through this transition. Menopause, which marks the end of a woman's reproductive years, can bring about a range of physical and emotional changes. These can include hot flashes, night sweats, fatigue, insomnia, mood swings, and decreased libido. Rapini believes that these symptoms can have a significant impact on a woman's emotional well-being, which in turn can affect her relationship. In her book, Rapini stresses that men need to be proactive in understanding and addressing the emotional effects of menopause. This means being understanding when their partner is feeling irritable or anxious, and being supportive when she's struggling with insomnia or hot flashes. It also means taking an active interest in maintaining intimacy, which can be a challenge during this time. Many women may feel self-conscious and unattractive during menopause, which can lead to decreased sexual desire. Rapini urges men to take the time to show their partners that they still find them desirable and attractive, and to be patient and understanding if sex is less frequent or less enjoyable for a time. Communication is key during this time, and Rapini encourages men to be open and honest with their partners about their concerns and feelings. This may include discussing any issues with erectile dysfunction or other sexual problems, which can be common in men as they age. By working through these issues together, couples can often find new ways to maintain intimacy and connection. Rapini also notes that menopause can be a time of transition for both partners, and that it's important to acknowledge and celebrate this. This can involve finding new ways to spend time together, whether it's exploring new hobbies or taking a romantic weekend getaway. By focusing on the positives of this new phase of life, couples can come out stronger and more connected than ever before. In conclusion, Mary Jo Rapini advocates for men to be understanding and supportive during their partner's menopause. By being proactive in addressing the emotional effects of menopause, and by maintaining open communication and intimacy, couples can navigate this time of transition with grace and confidence. With the right support and understanding, menopause can be a time of growth and renewed connection for couples.","“While menopause affects women physically, it’s not the lack of sex, night sweats or fatigue that leave men feeling unloved. It’s the emotional loss of their partner."" Houston TX (PRWEB) September 17, 2015 Menopause is no longer just for ‘older women’ with hot flashes, irritability and night sweats. An estimated 6,000 baby boomer women in the U.S. reach menopause every day and suffer both physical and emotional symptoms that can linger and interfere with their relationships and marriages. Hesitant to share her new emotions with her husband, divorce sometimes ensues. “Men often wonder why she rejects him in the bedroom, why she doesn’t want to go out as much, and why she seems colder, more anxious and feels old, unattractive, overweight, tired, overwhelmed and confused or depressed,” says Mary Jo Rapini, a licensed psychotherapist and co-author of newly published, Re-Coupling: A Couple’s 4-step Guide to Greater Intimacy and Better Sex. “While menopause affects women physically, it’s not the lack of sex, night sweats or fatigue that leave men feeling unloved. It’s the emotional loss of their partner. He sees her as still being beautiful, witty, charming, sexy and his main confidante’. Anyone who has ever tried to tell a woman she is beautiful when she believes she is not understands how futile it is and how easily she will dismiss the comment even if it was said with sincerity.” These 10 tips help couples cope with the change and can even draw one another closer: 1. Don’t take menopause symptoms personally. 2. Explore new ways to be intimate, the ones you traditionally used may not be comfortable anymore. 3. When she’s most irritable or angry ask her what’s going on--it most likely has nothing to do with you. 4. If there’s a problem, don’t ignore it--talk about it. 5. If she’s having hot flashes, cuddling or sleeping together might be too uncomfortable. Allow her space, but let her know you’re there. 6. Many women suffer with their loss of fertility. Be patient, listen and don’t make jokes. 7. There are no quick medical treatments available for the physical or emotional aspects as helpful as a loving, supportive partner. Hormone therapy helps, but it isn’t a magic cure, and many women cannot use it. 8. If sex is being avoided, it doesn’t mean she doesn’t love you anymore. It might be painful. Replens is a non-hormonal moisturizer that provides comfortable relief for three days and a good silicone lubricant like Wet Platinum or Replens Silky Smooth should be used just before and during sex. 9. Fifty is a tough time for men too, so be patient with one another. Mid-life is a couple’s challenge. Many men are silently suffering from erectile dysfunction. Stronvivo is a nutritional supplement that improves blood flow and erectile function by keeping blood circulating smoothly throughout the body, delivering nutrients and oxygen to the brain, muscles, organs, and skin. Natural pharmaceutical-grade ingredients including L-Arginine and L-Citrulline among others to support healthy hormone levels resulting in stronger erections for men making it a perfect companion to testosterone replacement therapy and increased sexual desire for women enhancing lubrication, arousal and orgasms while reducing vaginal pain. 10. Depression and anxiety can be part of menopause. Take it seriously and encourage her to talk to a mental health care professional if her symptoms become severe or persistent. “Couples who embrace the change in life as a temporary condition and go through it together do much better and remain much closer than those who don’t,” adds Rapini.

126,"Electric microgrids are quickly becoming a viable option for cities looking to safeguard themselves against future disasters. As weather patterns become more unpredictable and natural disasters become more frequent, cities are turning to microgrids to ensure that essential services remain up and running during times of crisis. Microgrids work by disconnecting from the main electrical grid and operating independently, drawing power from renewable energy sources such as solar power and wind turbines. This allows them to continue supplying critical services such as hospitals, emergency response centers, and communication networks even in the event of a power outage. The benefits of microgrids are clear, and it's no surprise that they are becoming increasingly popular. In fact, many cities are exploring the option of building their own microgrids to ensure that they are prepared for future disasters. One example of such a city is San Francisco. The city has recently completed a $2.5 million microgrid project that includes a battery storage system, solar panels, and a combined heat and power system. This project has already proven its worth, as it was able to keep San Francisco's public safety building up and running during a power outage in 2019. Another city that has turned to microgrids is New York. After the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the city decided to invest in microgrids to ensure that essential services could continue operating even in the event of another major storm. The Brooklyn Microgrid, which was launched in 2020, allows customers to generate and sell their own energy using solar panels and smart meters. While they may be costly to install, the benefits of microgrids are clear. They provide a reliable source of energy during times of crisis, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and allow for greater control over energy consumption. As natural disasters become more frequent and unpredictable, city planners must consider investing in microgrids to ensure that their communities stay up and running during times of crisis.","New York has seen the lights go out in spectacular ways in recent years. Almost the entire state went dark during the Great Northeast Blackout of 2003, and power outages sporadically shut down the 911 emergency services system. In 2008, more than 1.7 million upstate residents were plunged into darkness after a major ice storm split trees and crumbled the grid. And in 2012, Hurricane Sandy damaged power plants and equipment, shutting the power to millions of residents for days. These events - and the certainty of more in the future - have given the state plenty of reasons to look for new ways to prevent power loss in emergencies. In the search for solutions, though, a major problem keeps popping up. The standard model for a region’s electric grid is built around one or a few large plants producing electricity and shipping it often long distances on transmission lines to customers. If the plant or the line goes down, so does the grid. For authorities trying to overcome this structural issue, one idea is getting a serious look. It’s called a microgrid , and officials from Potsdam to Brooklyn are betting that the concept will keep the lights on the next time an unwelcome visitor threatens the flow of electricity to hospitals and other vital facilities. “Much of New York’s effort is predicated on resiliency,” says Lavelle Freeman, the manager of distribution, planning and engineering for GE’s Energy Consulting business. “Sandy is just the most recent example that has people asking: what you do to prevent the grid from collapsing for an extended period of time?” At its heart, a microgrid is a standalone power system embedded within a region’s grid that can operate independently when a power outage starts. During a disruption, a microgrid acts as a powered island that keeps critical infrastructure like fire and gas stations, clinics and telecommunications systems running."

128,"Eskom, South Africa's state-owned electricity provider, has issued a warning of potential load-shedding in the coming days. The utility company announced on Thursday that the country's power grid was under severe pressure due to a shortage of generating capacity, and load-shedding may be necessary to prevent a total blackout. Load-shedding is a controlled power outage implemented by Eskom when demand for electricity exceeds supply. The power is then rationed by switching off electricity to different areas at different times, allowing the grid to stabilise. Eskom asked South Africans to reduce their electricity consumption in order to ease the strain on the grid. It also appealed to businesses to reduce their electricity usage and switch off non-essential appliances during peak hours. Eskom has been grappling with a persistent power supply problem for years due to aging infrastructure and maintenance issues. The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated the situation, as lockdowns and social distancing measures led to a decrease in electricity consumption, which impacted Eskom's revenue and maintenance efforts. The prospect of load-shedding will be a major concern for South Africans already grappling with the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. Eskom has assured customers that it will do all it can to prevent load-shedding, but warns that it may be unavoidable if the situation worsens.","The risk of renewed load-shedding is real this week, Eskom said on Monday. It said planned maintenance of the Cahora Bassa hydroelectric station in Mozambique, an Eskom supplier, was being done until next Sunday. “As a result, South Africa will get 650 MW instead of the 1500 MW from Cahora Bassa on a daily basis [during maintenance],” Eskom said. “This maintenance is expected to be completed on Sunday 20 September, and the station is expected to be pumping at full capacity on Monday 21 September.” The power system will be tight, particularly over the weekday evening peak periods from Tuesday 15 September to Friday 18 September. Eskom urged consumers to continue using electricity sparingly to reduce the odds of load-shedding. “As the weather begins to warm up, usage of electricity becomes high for most of the day, predominantly due to the increased usage of air-conditioners, geysers and pool pumps,” it said.

129,"The recent stock rout in China has led to delays in establishing market links with Hong Kong, according to the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEx). HKEx CEO, Charles Li, announced that global market turbulence had been accompanied by a wave of new regulations that would have a significant impact on China's financial markets. ""These new regulations are causing delays in the implementation of market links between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland,"" Li said. The market links are a key part of the government's efforts to develop Hong Kong as an international financial center. The Stock Connect program, launched in 2014, allows Hong Kong and mainland Chinese investors to trade shares cross-border through the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE). A similar program, the Bond Connect, was launched in 2017 allowing investors to trade bonds through a similar mechanism. The HKEx had planned to launch the Southbound trading link with the Shanghai Stock Exchange, part of the Stock Connect program, in December 2020. However, the launch was postponed, with no new target date provided. Li said that the ongoing turmoil in global markets was adding to the difficulties already faced by regulators in China and Hong Kong. ""We understand that the regulator is facing many new challenges and is trying to find ways to address these issues,"" he said. Li noted that progress was being made in Hong Kong's efforts to reform and upgrade its financial system, with the introduction of new initiatives, including the launch of a new IPO mechanism to streamline the process of going public.

Chief Executive Officer Li said at a conference in Singapore yesterday. “You’d want to calm down, figure out how to clean up and then move forward.” More than nine months after the start of a trading link between equity markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai, investors are still waiting for news on when a similar program with Shenzhen will begin. Hong Kong Exchanges shares have tumbled 43 percent from their May peak as optimism waned that the connect would boost turnover and revenues. “Sentiment in mainland markets needs to get better” before regulators will consider setting a start date for Shenzhen, said Sam Chi Yung, a strategist at Delta Asia Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. “If the sentiment on the A-share market is not good, people may not be too interested if they launch the program now.” Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index is down 21 percent this quarter, the worst performer among major developed markets tracked by Bloomberg. The Shanghai Composite Index has fallen 25 percent in the same span, and almost USD5 trillion has been wiped off mainland markets since a mid-June peak.

130,"Credit Suisse Publishes Report on Evolving Consumer Perceptions about Fat According to a recent report published by Credit Suisse, consumer attitudes toward fat are rapidly changing in the United States. The report, which analyzes consumer perceptions and behaviors related to dietary fat, reveals significant shifts in attitudes towards healthy eating and lifestyle changes. The report emphasizes that consumers' perceptions of dietary fat are evolving, and health conscious individuals are more conscious of their fat consumption. The report suggests that the shift in attitudes has been caused by growing health concerns and extensive research linking diets high in fat to numerous health problems like heart diseases, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. The report also reveals that some types of fat are perceived more positively by consumers than others. Healthy fats such as monosaturated fats, which can be found in foods like olive oil and avocados, are becoming a preferred choice for people who view fat as a necessary component of their diet instead of avoiding it altogether. Saturated and trans fats, commonly found in processed foods, are receiving negative attention from consumers, who are more conscious of their impact on long-term health. The report suggests that the growing awareness of health risks is driving consumers to opt for healthier foods. The report further indicates that consumers tend to associate dietary fat with weight management, with 60% of the survey respondents associating lower-fat diets with weight loss. Consumers are exploring numerous diet options and are frequently switching to lower-fat diets in the pursuit of a healthier lifestyle. Another significant finding of the report is that the younger generation of consumers is more health-conscious and informed related to their dietary choices than their predecessors. This generation is more likely to read food labels and search for the relative amount of fat in the products that they purchase. This trend has emerged in recent years and has been fueled by growing awareness of health and fitness, which has become popular through social media and other digital platforms. Moreover, the report finds that millennials and Gen Z are consuming a more diverse range of plant-based alternatives to traditional meat and dairy-based products that are typically high in saturated fats. This change in the consumption of meat and dairy-based products is likely due to ethical, environmental, and health concerns. The report further indicates that awareness about low-fat diets is driving the popularity of plant-based diets such as vegetarian and veganism, which have a lower fat intake than diets with animal products. Preferences for plant-based diets and a focus on quality over quantity, observed in the younger generations, are creating new opportunities for healthy fats and protein substitutes, especially from plant-based sources. The Credit Suisse report concludes that consumers' attitudes towards dietary fat are fluctuating, with health and wellness concerns driving shifts in consumer behavior, and plant-based diets becoming popular. As consumers continue to prioritize quality and health over quantity, food product manufacturers, marketers, and retailers need to consider trends in low-fat or plant-based diets in their product development, marketing, and branding strategies. In summary, the Credit Suisse report highlights the growing awareness of the impacts of dietary fat on health and shows significant positive shifts in attitudes towards healthy eating and lifestyle choices. The changing patterns of consumption and consumer preferences bring new opportunities to the food industry, which can respond by offering healthier and plant-based products as alternatives to traditional diets. The report highlights the need for businesses to be aware of evolving consumer trends and adapt their strategies in line with them to sustain and drive growth.","NEW YORK , Sept. 17, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The Credit Suisse Research Institute today released a report entitled ""Fat: The New Health Paradigm"" which explores the influence of medical recommendations on fat consumption globally, the recent change in consumer perceptions of fat, and what impact this shift has for investors. While historically medical recommendations encouraged dramatically reducing consumption of saturated fats and cholesterol and placed no limits on polyunsaturated fats and carbohydrate intake, consumer buying patterns and medical research are now moving gradually away from these recommendations to favor food products with more natural unprocessed fats and rich in saturated and monounsaturated fats (organic dairy, grass-fed meats, natural oils, and nuts). The report illustrates this evolution by evaluating over 400 medical research papers and books written by academics and industry experts, and at the same time reveals the results of two proprietary surveys of doctors, nutritionists, and consumers. ""We found that 40% of nutritionists and 70% of general practitioners surveyed believe that eating cholesterol-rich foods has damaging cardiovascular effects. This is not true, according to the extensive research that has become available in recent years. Furthermore, they have limited knowledge of the potential benefits and risks of increased fat consumption,"" said Giles Keating, Vice Chairman of Investment Strategy & Research and Deputy Global Chief Investment Officer for Private Banking & Wealth Management. ""There is a concerning knowledge gap between the facts on fat and what consumers have been told."" In spite of this, consumer purchasing habits reveal that consumers are making new choices, which presents powerful investment ideas: global consumption of butter is growing globally at a rate of 2-4% annually; whole milk sales are up 11% while skim milk sales are down 14% in the US in the last six months; and organic egg consumption in the US is up 21% in the last 12 months. The report shows that fat consumption will continue to grow over the next fifteen years with fat accounting for 31% of calorie intake by 2030, up from 26% currently. Saturated fat should account for 13% of all calorie intake by 2030, from just above 9% now. ""We believe that consumers are at a turning point and this has distinct implications for investors. The report's conclusion is simple – natural unprocessed fats are healthy and are integral to transforming our society into one that focuses on developing and maintaining healthy individuals,"" said Stefano Natella, Global Head of Equity Research and an author of the study. Additional forecasts for macronutrient and fat-containing food consumption levels by 2030 include: GLOBAL Fat consumption per capita is likely to soar by 23%, protein by 12%, and carbs will likely decline by 2%. Total demand for fat will be much higher—up 43% or 1.9% a year—given the 16% growth in the global population expected over the next fifteen years. Within fat: Saturated fat is likely to grow from 9.4% in 2011 to 12.7% of daily energy intake and monounsaturated from 10.2% to 12.2%. Polyunsaturated omega-6 is expected to decline slightly from 6% to 5.4% and omega-3 will grow from 0.50% to 0.55% (excluding supplements). Carbohydrates will decline from 60% of global energy intake in 2011 to 55% by 2030. The rising awareness of the link between excess carbohydrate consumption and metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular issues will largely contribute to this decrease. Red meat consumption is expected to grow 23% over the next fifteen years. Egg consumption is expected to grow at a rate of 4% a year, as the cholesterol-heart link gradually disappears from people's minds. By 2030, the world could consume close to 300 eggs a year per capita (just over five eggs a week). REGIONAL The US : Meat consumption is forecasted to trend higher with red meat in the lead. Egg consumption should be 350 per year (almost one a day) up from 235 currently. Among solvent-extracted oils, a small decline is expected, with soybean oil still as the best-selling, including the new high-oleic versions. Butter should grow faster as the market learns the benefits of eating butter and as negative perceptions linked to saturated fats gradually disappears. Europe : Red meat consumption per capita is expected to grow 9% and poultry 19%. Fish consumption should grow slower at 12%, as consumption is already at a relative high level and availability is more constrained. Milk, cheese and yogurt should expand 11% or 0.7% a year, but butter consumption should grow 4% a year. The 5.5 kg per capita expected for 2030 is almost 10% below consumption in 1990. Egg consumption should increase sharply and expand by 42% or over 2% a year to 300 eggs a year per person. Vegetable oil consumption on a per capita basis should remain basically flat. Solvent-extracted oils should decline 10%, while natural oils (olive, palm, and coconut) should grow more than 30%, albeit from a small base.

131,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced a new program called the Submission Tracker that will allow pharmaceutical companies to track the progress of their drug applications in real-time. The Submission Tracker program will enable pharmaceutical companies to view updates and status changes of their submissions from the FDA in real-time. During the review process, the FDA will update the status of the drug application to provide transparency and give pharmaceutical companies a better sense of when their applications may be approved. The FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Director, Janet Woodcock, MD, emphasized the importance of the program in improving communication between the FDA and pharmaceutical companies. ""This new initiative is one of several ways we are working to enhance our communication with industry and improve the efficiency, consistency, and transparency of our regulatory processes,"" said Woodcock. Under the program, pharmaceutical companies will receive a unique identifier for each submission and can track their progress from the FDA’s beginning review, filing acceptance, review/evaluation, and decision stages. The program will also provide a secure portal for submitting and receiving documents, reducing the need for companies to send emails, faxes, or postal mail. The FDA expects the program to improve communication, streamline the submission process, and ultimately speed up the approval of new drugs. The agency has been actively working towards modernizing the drug approval process and streamlining the submission process to make it more efficient. The Submission Tracker complements other FDA initiatives to modernize drug regulation, including the implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act, and the reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA VI), which aims to improve the drug approval process for patients and industry. The Submission Tracker pilot program was launched in August this year, and a wider implementation of the program is expected to take place sometime this month. The FDA is continuing to work with the pharmaceutical companies that participated in the pilot program to improve and refine the initiative. In conclusion, the FDA's Submission Tracker program is a promising step towards a more efficient and streamlined drug approval process in the U.S. It is hoped that this program will ultimately lead to more effective communication and transparency between the FDA and pharmaceutical companies, leading to a quicker approval of new drugs that can benefit patients.","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been developing a pilot program aimed at making it easier for medical device companies to see, at a glance, how their device is progressing through the agency’s regulatory processes. The initiative is an effort to add transparency and eliminate confusion surrounding the often misunderstood “FDA Review Clock.” “We are in the initial stages of designing a website-based portal that would allow sponsors to check on the status of their 510(k) submissions that are under review by the FDA,” said Nels Anderson, a biomedical engineer within the FDA’s Vascular Surgery Device branch. The current mock-up—which in an interview with Regulatory Focus, Anderson emphasized was preliminary—includes an overview of the device, the FDA staff reviewing the device and their contact information, the status of the submission and the dates at which the device passed key review milestones, the current status of the FDA’s “review clock” under the Medical Device User Fee Act’s metrics, and the number of days an application has been with a sponsor (e.g., if FDA requests additional information). Shelton, Conn.-based Orchid Design has been selected by the agency to be the sole regulatory consulting firm to participate in its submission tracking initiative. “The insights gained from working directly with the FDA on this project will allow us to efficiently and effectively navigate the regulatory submission process, as well as bring important issues to the FDA’s attention from a perspective they may otherwise not have considered in the development of the Submission Tracker program,” said Kellen Hills, senior quality and regulatory consultant for Orchid Design. Orchid Design will be working alongside two of the largest medical device manufacturers to collaborate with the FDA on this project. Orchid Design, a division of Holt, Mich.-based Orchid Orthopedic Solutions, provides design, development and regulatory submission services. The company has two design centers located in Shelton and Memphis, Tenn., focused on the orthopedic medical device market. “We’re looking for three small companies that are willing to work with us on [the] project,” Anderson said. “While we have a number of large corporations working on this with us, we know that smaller companies will have different needs and a different take on the information and we want to make sure they are included in this process.” The input gained from this project will be used to create a larger pilot program.

132,"As the adult population continues to age, the number of single individuals who are living with chronic illnesses continues to rise. These individuals face unique challenges and fears when it comes to receiving the necessary care and support to maintain their quality of life. Without a partner or immediate family member to rely on, many sick and single individuals are left wondering, ""Who will care for me?"" According to a study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research, approximately one-third of single adults age 40 and older have one or more chronic health conditions. The study also found that single individuals are less likely to have a support system in place to help them manage their health conditions. This lack of support can lead to increased feelings of isolation and frustration for individuals who are already struggling with health complications. Additionally, it can be difficult for sick and single individuals to navigate the healthcare system on their own. Linda Smith, a 53-year-old single woman living with multiple sclerosis, shared her experience with HealthMediciNet.com. ""I don't have any family nearby, and my friends all have busy lives of their own,"" she explained. ""When I need assistance with daily living tasks, like cooking or cleaning, I often have to rely on expensive home health aides or struggle to do things on my own."" Smith's story highlights the challenges that many sick and single individuals face on a daily basis. However, there are resources available to help address these issues. One option is to join a support group for individuals living with chronic illnesses. These groups provide a space for individuals to connect with others who are facing similar challenges and to receive emotional support and practical advice for managing their conditions. Additionally, there are organizations that specialize in providing services and support to sick and single individuals. For example, The Singles Community provides a variety of resources for single individuals facing health concerns, including access to affordable home health aides and peer support networks. It is also important for sick and single individuals to advocate for themselves when it comes to healthcare. This may include researching healthcare providers who have experience working with individuals with chronic conditions and being proactive in discussing treatment options and care plans. Furthermore, it is essential that policymakers and healthcare providers recognize the unique needs and challenges facing sick and single individuals. This population deserves access to quality healthcare and the support necessary to maintain their wellbeing. As the population continues to age, it is likely that the number of sick and single individuals will continue to grow. It is up to all of us, as a society, to ensure that these individuals have the resources and support necessary to live their best lives. In conclusion, sick and single individuals face a range of challenges when it comes to receiving the care and support necessary to manage chronic health conditions. However, by utilizing available resources and advocating for themselves, these individuals can overcome these obstacles and maintain their quality of life. It is up to all of us to prioritize the needs of this population and ensure that they receive the care and support they deserve.","A wave of relief swept over me when, at my first appointment to a new rheumatologist, she said she had a name for the elusive condition that threatened my life and sickened me for more than a decade and a half. I now knew, for certain, that I was right; all of my symptoms were tied to just one disease. However, my joy was short-lived. Seconds later, I was told that the autoimmune disease battering my body, igG4 related systemic disease, had no cure. As a single woman, I wondered, who would care for me if I could not. At that time, I lived alone in a townhouse, in a city where I knew no one other than my next door neighbor. My home had stairs, slot of them, which often, pain would not allow me to climb. I worked full-time to maintain health insurance and prescription coverage. My job also allowed me to try meeting the debilitating obligations of my never-ending medical bills because there was no one else providing me with financial support. My rheumatologist ordered blood tests, CT scans, x-rays and MRI’s to confirm her diagnosis and then came a new round of drugs, aimed at controlling the inflammation that damaged organs in my body. The “what ifs” flooded in and gave me a headache over the next few months as. What if I can’t work anymore? How will I survive? Will I have to sell my home? How will I pay for in house care or a nursing home? If I can stay in my townhome, is it safe? What if I fall ill in the house alone? Who will be able to get in to get me help? I thought I was prepared for anything when I bought more life insurance and had my will, healthy proxy, living will and power of attorney updated. But, that only took care of my financial matters, my funeral and medical wishes but not my everyday needs. I’d neglected to buy long term disability insurance when I was well. By the time I finally applied my pre-existing condition prevented from getting it. I thought about rebuilding my savings so I could pay for private care on my own if I couldn’t work. However, trying to avoid being sued over doctor’s bills or being forced to file for bankruptcy made it impossible for me to accumulate any real wealth. I knew I didn’t want my parents to shoulder all the burden of caring for me nor did I want to move into their house. So, I was motivated to get creative to solve the question: Who will care for me? I jotted down a list of relatives and close friends who I could call upon, in a rotation, to avoid stressing any one person out or abusing their generosity. I looked for services that I could afford that could help me maintain my independence: carpet cleaners, maid services, grocery stores that let you shop from home and have your groceries delivered, and handyman services. I put handheld shower heads in all the bathrooms so I could sit down and wash myself. I also got a car that had seats that folded down for the times I could walk on my own and required a walker or wheelchair. I switched most of my bills from paper to electronic so they could be paid online. By far, the hardest thing I had to learn to do was ask for help and learn to take it when it’s offered. I had to change my attitude by not seeing myself as helpless just because I need some help; that made a world of difference. I began letting other people know when my doctor’s appointments and procedures were scheduled so they knew when I might need to be picked up or require assistance. Before I knew it is assemble an army, that’s ready, willing and able to care for me at those times I can’t care for myself. nikabeamon.com"
133,"Eight Mexican tourists were tragically killed in a recent military strike on a tourist convoy in the Egyptian desert. The deadly incident occurred on September 13th, 2015, near the peaceful oasis town of Bahariya, a popular tourist destination well-known for its stunning natural beauty and rich history. According to reports, a group of tourists had been traveling in four-wheel drive vehicles on an organized tour when they were mistakenly attacked by the Egyptian military. Eight Mexican nationals were confirmed dead, with a further six injured in the attack. The other tourists, who hailed from other countries including Argentina, Portugal, and Spain, escaped unharmed. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has expressed his condolences to the families of those who lost their lives, stating that the government would do everything in its power to ensure that justice is served for the victims. ""The Mexican government strongly condemns these egregious and unacceptable actions which have led to the death of Mexicans on Egyptian soil,"" said President Nieto in a statement. ""We have demanded a thorough investigation into the incident and will do everything within our power to ensure that justice is done for the victims and their families."" Egyptian authorities have also expressed their regret over the incident and have promised a full investigation. Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement saying that the government would spare no effort in ensuring that those responsible are held accountable for their actions. ""The government of Egypt expresses its deep condolences to the Mexican people for the tragic loss of life in the Bahariya Oasis incident. Investigations are underway to determine the circumstances of the incident and those responsible. Egypt affirms that it spares no effort in ensuring the safety and security of its residents and visitors alike,"" said the statement. The incident has prompted both Mexico and Egypt to review their respective travel advisories for their citizens. Mexico has urged its citizens to postpone any non-essential travel to Egypt until the situation is clearer, while Egypt has issued an apology to the Mexican people and has pledged to increase security measures in tourist destinations to ensure the safety of visitors. The deadly incident has shocked the international community, with many countries offering their support and condolences to the victims and their families. It serves as a reminder of the fragile nature of international relations and the importance of effective communication and cooperation between nations to avoid such unfortunate incidents in the future.","Mexico's Foreign Affairs Ministry on Tuesday confirmed a total of eight Mexican tourists have died in an Egyptian military airstrike on their convoy. ""Six more Mexicans have been identified among the fatal victims of the attack perpetrated against a group of tourists Sunday in Egypt,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""Regrettably it has been confirmed that 8 Mexicans lost their lives in the tragic incident in Egypt,"" President Enrique Pena Nieto announced at the same time via Twitter. At least six others were wounded. Reina Torres, director of the ministry's department for protecting nationals abroad, said Monday the wounded were in ""stable"" conditions, and at least one of them would be released from hospital in the coming hours. ""Several of them suffered burns or have shrapnel from the bombs,"" Torres said in a radio interview. Initially, two Mexican tourists were confirmed dead in what Egyptian officials described as a case of mistaken identity after military troops and police officers pursuing anti-government guerrillas shelled the four-vehicle convoy from the air. The Western Desert, where the incident took place, has traditionally been a tourist attraction for its tall sand dunes and verdant oases. The area is currently a restricted zone off-limits to civilians, but the group's travel agency had secured the necessary permit. ""It's customary to grant permits for tourist visits"" to the site, Mexico's Foreign Affairs Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu said at a press conference Monday. The strike has also raised questions on targeting the convoy from the air as the passengers had reportedly stopped for a picnic-style meal. Ruiz Massieu flew to Cairo late Monday, accompanied by families of the victims, personnel from the Health Ministry and police forensics experts, local daily La Jornada reported. So far, only one of the fatal victims has been identified: Rafael Bejarano Rangel, a musician whose mother Marisela Rangel Davalos, one of the hospitalized, organized the visit to Egypt. Rangel Davalos' sister, Araceli Rangel Davalos, has said similar trips to Egypt had been organized many times before, with the same guide and travel agency, and that there had never been a problem. Four Egyptians, including guides and drivers, were also killed, and another two wounded, according to a spokesman for Egypt's Interior Ministry, Ayman Helmi. Mexico's government Monday demanded Egypt launch a ""swift and in-depth"" investigation into the accidental strike. Eygpt's embassy in Mexico said the government will establish an ""investigative committee headed by the prime minister himself to resolve the case and publish the results,"" according to Mexico's ministry.

137,"A great way to define your eyelid and make your eyes stand out is by trying out a cut crease eye makeup look. This style of eye makeup has been a trend for a while, and it's not hard to see why. It's simple yet striking, versatile enough to be worn for any occasion, and can highlight your best features. The cut crease is a technique that consists of creating a sharp line in the crease of your eyelid, which separates the lid from the brow bone. It can be achieved using a variety of eyeshadow shades, but for a dramatic effect, darker hues work best. To create a cut crease eye makeup look, you'll need a few essential tools such as eyeshadow brushes, primer, concealer, and of course, eyeshadow. Begin by applying a primer to your entire eyelid to ensure that your eyeshadow lasts all day. Then, apply a concealer on the lid area to create a clean base for your eyeshadow. Next, using a thin brush, apply a dark-colored eyeshadow along the crease of your eyelid to create a sharp line. Blend the edges carefully to avoid any harsh lines. Once you've got your cut crease, you can then apply a lighter shade on the lid area to make it pop. Finally, finish off the look with eyeliner, mascara, and false eyelashes if you wish. The result will be a stunning look that opens up your eyes. The cut crease eye makeup look is an excellent way to showcase your creativity and style while enhancing your natural features. With a little bit of practice and patience, you'll be able to master this technique and create a stunning and sophisticated look. So why not give it a try? Your eyes will thank you.","Search the term ""cut crease"" on YouTube and you'll find hundreds of tutorials on the eye makeup look. Just as the name describes, it's a technique used to define the crease by ""cutting"" across it with a contrasting eyeshadow color and little to no blending. ""If done right, a cut crease will change your makeup game if you have a medium to heavy fold. It lifts your eyes and makes them appear more open,"" says makeup artist and YouTuber Sona Gasparian . ""You instantly lift your eyelids with this technique. And what's great about it is that you can go super soft or really dramatic depending on your mood."" If you're new to the technique, she says a good tip is to keep the intensity on the outer corner of the eyes. ""Start slow and build the intensity to achieve the most natural look,"" she says. ""The best way is to keep your eyes open when placing your cut crease. Look straight in the mirror and place a line where you want your new fold to appear, and start to build the shadow over the line blending upward."" Gasparian says she likes to keep her makeup looks natural, so she blends her cut crease a little more than usual and demonstrates it in her Taylor Swift Bad Blood Makeup Tutorial below: [embedded content] If you're looking for more intensity, check out this version by YouTuber ChrisppyMakeup : [embedded content] Here's another by YouTuber Lauren Curtis that shows the cut crease at it's most basic level: [embedded content] See more of what's trending on our new Lipstick Index: Photo by YouTuber MakeupbyAlli"
138,"Legendary Argentinian footballer, Diego Maradona, has publicly criticized former FIFA President, Sepp Blatter, and former UEFA President, Michel Platini. Maradona's comments come in response to Blatter's recent claims that he and Platini are victims of a ""plot"" to remove them from the football world. Maradona, who has been a vocal critic of FIFA for years, called Blatter and Platini ""thieves"" and accused them of being involved in corruption within the organization. He also called for a complete overhaul of FIFA's structure and for those involved in previous corrupt practices to be held accountable. Speaking to reporters, Maradona said, ""Blatter and Platini are not victims, they are the problem. They have been stealing from the game for years and now they want sympathy? No way. FIFA needs to clean house and start fresh."" Blatter and Platini were both banned from football for several years following a corruption scandal in 2015. Both have denied any wrongdoing and have been appealing their bans. Maradona's comments come at a time when FIFA is trying to rebuild its reputation after years of corruption scandals. The organization recently announced a series of reforms aimed at increasing transparency and accountability. Despite these efforts, there are still concerns that FIFA has not done enough to address the issues of corruption and bribery within the organization. Many believe that it will take a complete change in leadership and culture for FIFA to truly move forward. Maradona's comments are likely to be welcomed by those who believe that FIFA needs to take stronger action against corruption within the organization. Whether his calls for change will be heard by those in power remains to be seen.","15 de septiembre de 2015, 15:52 Rome, 15 Sep (Prensa Latina) Argentinian super star Diego Maradona has trashed the idea of UEFA President Michel Platini succeeding Sepp Blatter as new FIFA president. Argentinian football legend Maradona suggests Platini is every bit as corrupt as the disgraced, outgoing Blatter. He has also suggested he'll stand by the side of another candidate come election time. During an appearance on Naples television station PiuEnne Maradona made it clear he considers voting for Platini as merely a vote to continue the same culture of corruption that has recently defined football's governing body: ""Blatter did a lot of harm to football and with Platini, it's a farce. They pretend to be separated, one at FIFA and the other at UEFA, while in fact they were always side by side."" Maradona didn't stop there. He stressed that Platini is no different than Blatter and that the Frenchman is the wrong man to introduce much needed change at the top of the sport: ""If we want a transparent FIFA, we cannot vote for Platini who has been close to Blatter, who taught him how to steal."" The controversial former World Cup winner revealed he will back Prince Ali of Jordan for the presidency. Maradona even intends to work alongside Ali should the Prince win: ""If he should win the election, I will be at his side as vice-president."" sgl/ro/lp"

142,"A fire has broken out in a block of flats and shops, causing the evacuation of 20 people. Fire crews were called to the scene on High Street in the early hours of the morning, and were met with a fierce blaze that had already spread to the upper floors of the building. Local residents reported hearing explosions and seeing flames shooting out of the windows as the fire took hold. Emergency services responded quickly, with multiple fire engines and ambulances on the scene within minutes. The fire, which is believed to have started in one of the flats, quickly spread to neighbouring properties, including a hair salon and a convenience store. Firefighters worked tirelessly to extinguish the flames and prevent the fire from spreading any further. A spokesperson for the fire service said that crews had been faced with a challenging situation due to the layout of the building and the intensity of the fire. However, their swift actions and expertise had prevented any serious injuries or loss of life. ""We are pleased to report that all residents have been safely evacuated from the building and there are no reports of any casualties at this time,"" they said. ""Our firefighters have done an incredible job in containing the fire and preventing it from causing any further damage to the surrounding properties.""

""It was really scary and I just hoped that everyone was alright."" The incident has also sparked calls for increased safety measures in the area, with some residents calling for more regular fire safety checks and better education on fire prevention. For now, however, emergency services continue to work at the scene, as they investigate the cause of the fire and begin the long process of cleaning up and restoring the affected properties. All those affected are being urged to seek support from local authorities and charities in the wake of this devastating incident.","Around 20 people were evacuated from their homes after an ""apocalyptic"" fire broke out in a market town.

Hundreds of people spilled on to the street below as flames ripped through the old building and thick, black smoke billowed into the sky. Families, some with small children and in tears, were evacuated from their homes and given blankets by ambulance crews. Sarah Pheby, 28, an administrator whose flat is across the street, said: ""The fire looks apocalyptic. ""I could feel the heat of the flames on my face when I looked at it through the window, and that was through my double glazing. ""The first floor of the building has collapsed, it is just a shell now. The roof has gone. ""It started in Celebrity Nails, which isn't a particularly big shop. Then there was an explosion and it just spread incredibly quickly."" She said firefighters in cherry pickers were sent up to people trapped in the flats above. She said: ""There was someone in the top floor, I hope they got out OK. I could see them in the top floor window, the firefighters went up there.""

Police were called at 6.25pm to help and at 7pm a full evacuation of the area was launched. Luke Cresswell, a teaching assistant and local councillor, said: ""I saw around 20 people being evacuated. They were given covers and looked really upset. ""There were families including children. They looked really shaken up, some of them were crying.

145,"A new study has raised the question of whether Alzheimer’s disease can be transmitted between people. The study, published in the journal Nature, found evidence in postmortem brain tissue that suggests the disease may be transmissible in some cases. The researchers analyzed the brains of eight people who had received injections of human growth hormone from cadavers contaminated with prions, the infectious proteins that cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Seven of the eight people showed signs of Alzheimer’s disease, and the researchers found amyloid-beta protein deposits in their brains, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s. While the study does not provide definitive proof that Alzheimer’s disease can be transmitted between people, it raises concerns about the safety of medical procedures involving tissues or fluids from people with Alzheimer’s. The researchers caution that the risk of transmission is likely to be very low and that their findings do not suggest Alzheimer’s can be transmitted through casual contact or everyday activities. Experts in the field have called for more research to determine the potential for Alzheimer’s transmission and to develop better methods for preventing it. In the meantime, those who work in the medical field should take precautions to limit exposure to Alzheimer’s tissues and fluids. Overall, the study suggests that more attention should be paid to the potential for Alzheimer’s transmission in medical settings, and that more research is needed to fully understand the risks and possible preventative measures.","A small study is making big headlines, as the results suggest a possible link between specialized medical procedures and a precursor to what is believed to be Alzheimer’s-related proteins. The study, published in the scientific journal Read more trending stories CJD is caused by an infectious protein known as a prion. One theory suggests that Alzheimer's disease may also be triggered by proteins that have gone rogue. The presence of plaque in patients aged 36 to 51 is rare, and scientists involved in the study suspect that seeds of the amyloid protein may have transferred to the patients from the hGH injections they received, according to Nature. If the results prove to be true after further study, it could have major implications in the surgical room. Specialized surgical tools and equipment might be required to undergo expensive decontamination procedures. But skeptics warn that the study's sample size of just eight subjects is too small to draw any solid conclusions. Health experts encourage everyone to continue undergoing any medical procedures they've been advised to have.

147,"As fall arrives, so does football season, and with it comes one of America's great traditions - tailgating. Whether it's at a high school, college or NFL game, tailgating brings together people for cookouts, games, and good times before the game. However, not everyone can make it to the tailgate due to conflicts or distance. If you can't make it to the tailgate, don't despair - you can still enjoy the game with your friends while having your own ""staygate"" party. Here are some ideas on how to host the ultimate staygate: Create the right atmosphere To create the perfect atmosphere for your staygate, you should have a good TV, multiple couches or chairs and decorations in your sports team colors. You can also add a few outdoor decorations if the weather permits to create a fun party atmosphere. Provide the right food & beverages While you will miss out on traditional tailgating food like burgers and hot dogs, you can still offer excellent party food, such as chips and dip, pretzels, popcorn, and pizza. You can provide your favorite beverages, whether it is beer, soda or fruit juice for non-drinkers. Set up a mini-game area One of the best things about tailgating is playing games and having a good time with friends. You can recreate that vibe in your staygate by setting up small games, such as cornhole or beer pong, to keep your guests entertained during commercials or halftime. Make it interactive If your friends are watching the game at home, create a social media hashtag that everyone can use to share pictures and videos of your staygate party. This way, your staygate party attendees can feel like they are a part of a bigger celebration. Host a competition While you're watching the game, you can make it more exciting by holding a small competition. You can do this by having a friendly wager on the game's outcome or host a beer tasting contest. You can provide a prize for the winner, such as a sports team hat or other merchandise. Final thoughts If you can't make it to the tailgate, don't worry, you can still enjoy the game while having your own ""staygate"" party. Creating the right atmosphere, offering the right food and beverages, setting up a mini-game area, making it interactive, and hosting a competition are some ways you can have the ultimate staygate party. Whether you are hosting a small staygate with your closest friends or going big and inviting your whole neighborhood, the right preparation and planning can make your staygate party one for the books. So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the game with your friends, no matter where you are!","(BPT) - With college football season upon us, there’s no better way to enjoy time with family and friends than getting together to cheer on your favorite team. This year, with rising ticket, concession and travel costs, why not gather your friends and family together for a private “staygating” party in your own living room? Here are five tips to hosting the ultimate staygate this fall to do game day right. * Pick your game day early! Do you have a favorite rivalry game? Is there a certain Saturday that promises lots of good conference showdowns? Plan now and let your friends and family know you’ll be hosting an all-day staygate so you can get a full house and an accurate headcount. Email invites make it easy to get an accurate headcount, especially if your staygating party is a larger affair. They are also more environmentally friendly, and best of all, free! * Impress your guests by watching the game on an amazing television — like the OLED 4K TV s from LG, which allow your fans to experience each moment with the best picture quality on the market. OLED technology delivers a breathtaking picture with perfect blacks and amazing color, even at wide viewing angles — so every seat in the house feels like the 50-yard line. * Create a stadium atmosphere to set the stage for game day. Easily set up a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth-capable multi-room speaker system, like LG’s Music Flow , to play a game day soundtrack featuring your team’s fight song and popular in-game anthems to get your crowd pumped up before kickoff and keep them energized throughout the game. Just use your smartphone to stream your playlist from your favorite service via the Music Flow Player App to get the party started. By adding a Music Flow sound bar and surround system, it will enhance the viewing experience with enveloping game day sounds of bands and cheering crowds. * Serve a creative spread. Game day snacks can make or break the atmosphere of a staygate, so make certain your fans aren’t calling foul on what you serve. Go online to order local favorites, from wings and pizza to sliders and nachos, to give your guests a taste of what it’s like to be back on campus, or color-coordinate your spread to create a celebratory vibe. For inspiration, check out your favorite team sites or regional food blogs. * Stock up on game day essentials. Once your RSVP list is finalized, don’t forget to stock up on festive game day favorites. Encourage your guests to dress for the occasion! Just because the team can’t see you, doesn’t mean your lucky socks are any less lucky. Break out those team colors, wear them with pride and challenge your fellow staygaters to do the same. Do you cheer on your team with shakers or foam fingers? Cowbells or clappers? Recreate that stadium electricity by offering your fans the same fun noisemakers at your staygate.

Belarus has always been known for its strong industrial base, while India is widely recognized for its prowess in the IT sector. Together, the collaboration could potentially combine the best of both worlds to make for a very powerful collaboration. This collaboration comes at a time when Belarus is actively exploring ways to improve its position in the global market. By joining hands with India, Belarus now has a strong partner in a rapidly growing economy, with a billion-strong population. ""We are happy to join hands with Belarus and strengthen our economic partnership. This project will benefit both our countries by boosting exports and investment,"" said the Indian side. The agreement has the potential to create jobs, increase investment and trade between these two countries, as well as help businesses expand their global market presence. The common brand could be used to promote a variety of products, such as industrial equipment and machinery, as well as IT and hardware products. The joint endeavour is seen as a win-win situation for both Belarus and India. The agreement will not only provide a much-needed boost to the Belarusian economy, but it will also bring more competition to the global market, with Indian companies exporting under a common brand with their Belarusian counterparts. The collaboration between Belarus and India is expected to begin very soon. Both sides have started working on a common strategy to market their products under the common brand. If successful, this collaboration could become a model for other countries to follow, demonstrating how two countries can work together to achieve mutually beneficial goals.","(BelTA) – Industrial companies of Belarus and India intend to enter third-country markets with a common brand. Belarusian Deputy Industry Minister Dmitry Korchik made the statement during the online conference hosted by the BelTA website on 24 September. The official noted that during the latest session of the Belarusian-Indian intergovernmental commission the sides discussed the establishment of Belarusian industrial enterprises in India using the economic conditions the Indian side offers. Apart from that, an agreement to start assembling Belarusian tractors in India was signed. “As far as assembly enterprises are concerned, we are now looking into the matter together with Indian partners. It is necessary to decide on joint actions in October because there are certain peculiarities to take care of. As you know, India is an internationally recognized leader in tractor manufacturing. The country puts serious effort into developing the automobile engineering industry. We should find a joint niche, a joint product in order to get it made at assembly enterprises in India,” explained the Belarusian Deputy Industry Minister. At the same time shipments to third countries — Africa and Asia — where India already enjoys certain influence are under consideration. “We are talking about a new product in the countries where Belarus is not present for now while India has achieved certain success. We plan to reach those markets with a joint brand, a joint product in order to further develop our export geography. We cannot stay idle in this regard. It is necessary to act as fast as possible to agree business operation terms with the partners, to make up our minds on the products we are going to assemble together, and the technologies and conditions for setting up the joint ventures. The work has to be completed in H1 2016 at the latest,” informed Dmitry Korchik. The official also said he stays in touch with Indian partners of the Belarusian automobile manufacturing company BelAZ. There are plans to set up a service center by the end of the year. It will allow shipping more mining vehicles. “Those are complicated vehicles. It would be very hard to sell them in this region without comprehensive aftersales service,” explained the Deputy Industry Minister. The official pointed out that just like China and Pakistan India represents a serious market for Belarus. Among other things Belarus intends to be part of the Make in India program. “The program is a major step on the part of the Indian government to attract investors, develop the manufacturing industry and other ones. India has created the program to get investments and create jobs. The country does not want to import merchandise. India wants to make it instead. It is a good offer for us,” Dmitry Korchik was convinced. In his words, the Make in India program provides for creating more attractive conditions — customs, taxation, transport, and manpower ones — for foreign companies. Belarusian companies such as MTZ, BelAZ, MAZ, and Gomselmash can take part in the program."

The decrease, effective from March 1, 2021, is due to the recent retreat in bunker prices, according to the company. The German carrier's move follows a similar announcement made by Maersk in February. In a statement, Hapag-Lloyd said it will continue to closely monitor bunker prices and fuel consumption, and will adjust its fuel surcharge accordingly. The company added that it remains committed to reducing its environmental footprint, including through the use of low-sulfur fuels and the implementation of other sustainability measures.","Europe's fourth-largest container shipping line, Hapag-Lloyd AG , has announced that from October 3, 2015, it will revise the bunker adjustment factor (BAF) applicable for all containerized shipments from North East Asia to Australia.

Last month, the Hamburg-headquartered transportation company announced that it had revised its BAF for all containerised shipments from North East Asia to Australia to USD 275 per TEU.

153,"Yingli Green Energy, the largest solar panel manufacturer in the world, has released its second-quarter financial report for 2015. The company reported a net loss of RMB 378.2 million ($61.1 million), compared to a net loss of RMB 475.8 million ($76.9 million) in the previous quarter. This loss is attributed to the falling price of solar panels globally, which has led to reduced revenue for the company. However, Yingli Green Energy managed to increase its shipments of solar panels by 39.6% from the previous quarter, totaling 1,073.2 MW. This increase in shipments is due to the company's strategy of expanding into new markets and improving its global distribution network. Yingli Green Energy's gross margin for the second quarter was 14.5%, compared to 14.2% in the previous quarter. The company's operating expenses decreased by 4.7% compared to the previous quarter, due to cost-cutting measures. ""We are seeing improving trends in our business, driven by the recovery of the solar market in China and the steady growth of the market in the US,"" said Mr. Liansheng Miao, Chairman and CEO of Yingli Green Energy. ""We are focused on maintaining our strong position in the global market by further expanding our market share and optimizing our cost structure.""

""This partnership will enable us to expand our presence in China and leverage the extensive experience and resources of China Minsheng New Energy Investment in the renewable energy sector.""

In conclusion, Yingli Green Energy's second-quarter financial report shows that the company is making progress in improving its financial stability and expanding its market share.

Second Quarter 2015 Financial Results Total Net Revenues Total net revenues were RMB2,716.1 million ( US$438.1 million ) in the second quarter of 2015, compared to RMB2,905.8 million in the first quarter of 2015 and RMB3,408.9 million in the second quarter of 2014.

Revenues were not recognized for 43.2MW of internal shipments as required by U.S. GAAP. The decrease in total net revenues in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2015 was mainly due to a decrease of PV module shipments in the second quarter of 2015 and decline in the average selling price of PV modules, which was primarily due to higher proportion of our shipment to China market and the depreciation of Euro and Japanese Yen against Renminbi in the quarter. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit was RMB171.0 million ( US$27.6 million ) in the second quarter of 2015, compared to RMB410.8 million in the first quarter of 2015 and RMB532.1 million in the second quarter of 2014. Gross margin was 6.3% in the second quarter of 2015, compared to 14.1% in the first quarter of 2015 and 15.6% in the second quarter of 2014. The decrease in gross profit and gross margin from the first quarter of 2015 to the second quarter of 2015 was mainly due to the decline in average selling price of PV modu les a nd the increase in unit manufacturing cost as a result of a lower utilization rate of production facilities in the second quarter of 2015. Gross margin on sales of PV modules was 7.9% in the second quarter of 2015. Operating Expenses Operating expenses decreased to RMB349.3 million ( US$56.3 million ) in the second quarter of 2015 from RMB477.2 million in the first quarter of 2015, and compared to RMB618.1 million in the second quarter of 2014. The decrease in operating expenses from the first quarter of 2015 to the second quarter of 2015 was mainly due to the recognition of a gain from disposal of the land use rights held by Fine Silicon, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yingli Green Energy. Operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues were 12.9 % in the second quarter of 2015, reduced from 16.4% in the first quarter of 2015 and 18.1% in the second quarter of 2014.

The decrease in foreign currency exchange loss from the first quarter of 2015 was mainly due to less fluctuation of the exchange rates between Euros and Renminbi in the second quarter of 2015. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense was RMB232.6 million ( US$37.5 million ) in the second quarter of 2015, compared to income tax expense of RMB0.5 million in the first quarter of 2015 and income tax expense of RMB1.2 million in the second quarter of 2014.

The C ompany is also working on a number of financing options to continue to manage the Company's liquidity and to enhance its financial flexibility. Downstream Development in 2015 In China , the Company began the construction of 78 MW of PV projects and connected 94 MW of PV projects to the grid in the second quarter 2015. As of June 30, 2015 , the Company had a total of over 400 MW of PV projects under construction across a dozen provinces in China . In July, the Company was selected to develop and construct a 50 MW PV project in Shanxi Province , China , which will be one of the key demonstration projects of National Energy Administration's ""Top Runner"" program. In consideration of China's nationwide delay in subsidy allocation, long-term operation of large ground-mounted PV stations would require significant capital. Accordingly, the Company has adopted a more prudent approach to downstream project development business and is in active negotiations with certain leading corporations about potential sale of the PV projects developed by the Company. The Company has approximately 100MW of PV projects sold or close to sale to those parties. Expected Non-Cash Impairment Charge on Long Lived Assets in Third Quarter and Fiscal Year 2015 As a result of the lower-than-expected utilization of certain production facilities of the Company in the second quarter of 2015 and the expected continuation of such utilization in the remaining quarters of 2015, the Company has concluded that impairment triggering events have become apparent in the third quarter of 2015 and has begun the process of performing its long-lived asset impairment analysis with respect to those production facilities. While the impairment analysis has not been completed yet, the Company expects to recognize a significant amount of non-cash impairment charge on those production facilities in the third quarter of 2015, which will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial results for the third quarter of 2015 and fiscal year 2015. Business Outlook for Third Quarter and Fiscal Year 2015 Third Quarter of 2015 Based on current market conditions, the Company's current operating conditions, estimated production capacity and forecasted customer demand, the Company expects its PV module shipments to be in the estimated range of 550 MW to 580 MW for the quarter ending September 30, 2015 . Fiscal Year 2015 Based on current market conditions, the Company's current operating conditions, estimated production capacity and forecasted customer demand, the Company expects its total PV module shipments to be 2.5 GW to 2.8 GW for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015 . Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement the financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating loss, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per ordinary share and per ADS and EBITDA, each of which (other than EBITDA) is adjusted to exclude, as applicable, items related to share-based compensation, interest expense related to the changes in the fair value of the interest-rate swap and the amortization of the debt discount, the amortization of intangible assets, inventory provision and non-cash provision for inventory purchase commitments. EBITDA excludes interest, tax expenses, depreciation and amortization. The Company believes excluding these items from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful for its management and investors to assess and analyze the Company's on-going performance as such items are not directly attributable to the underlying performance of the Company's business operations and/or do not impact its cash earnings. The Company also believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important to help investors understand the Company's current financial performance and future prospects and compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see the financial information included elsewhere in this press release. Currency Conversion Solely for the convenience of readers, certain Renminbi amounts have been translated into U.S. dollar amounts at the rate of RMB6.2000 to US$1.00 , the noon buying rate in New York for cable transfers of Renminbi per U.S. dollar as set forth in the H.10 weekly statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board as of June 30, 2015 . No representation is intended to imply that these translated Renminbi amounts could have been, or could be, converted, realized or settled into U.S. dollar amounts at such rate, or at any other rate.

(Photo: File) Studio 247 Fine Jewelry opened Tuesday at 247 S. Nicolet Road in Grand Chute. Its large, luxurious jewelry boutique space, between Willows Bend and Gather Americana, is familiar to high-end shoppers as it once was Earth Resources founded by the late John Barlow and owned by his daughter Alice. Studio 247 is making good use of Earth Resources’ wood-trimmed glass jewelry cases and counters for its red carpet-worthy classic necklaces and earrings. Craig Slavens, Studio 247 co-owner, knows the space well as he was a jewelry designer at Earth Resources for three years, several years before its 2012 closure. Studio 247 is a different kind of jewelry store, he said, because it doesn’t just carry high-end and custom jewelry. Bracelet designed by Craig Slavens of Studio 247 Fine Jewelry in Grand Chute. (Photo: Courtesy of Craig Slavens) “We have unusual, one-of-a-kind pieces in every price range,” he said. “It has upscale decor, and we love the space, but we want everyone to feel comfortable. Sure, we want the $40,000 sale, but we don’t want someone with a few hundred to spend to feel out of place. One woman just purchased a pair of amber earrings for $245.” He and shop co-owner Milada Rice added wedding rings and displays of wear-everyday jewelry that can be as little as $50 for a handmade pair of sterling silver earrings. An estate jewelery counter includes cameos that had been photographed for Vogue. Rice is also assembling a side room of vintage accessories, starting with her grandmother’s own high-end collection of handbags, shoes and hats. Their family operates Rice Family Industries and Waupaca Elevator Co. Slavens, a Californian, is a gemologist, designer and expert on both rare pink diamonds and diamond grading. One of his designs in the shop is a pink pear-shaped diamond ring for $42,500. A rare pink pear-shaped diamond is paired with white diamonds in Craig Slavens' ""bypass"" ring design. (Photo: Courtesy of Craig Slavens) When he learned this space was available, he began working on a plan for it with the Rice family. After Earth Resources, he moved to Arkansas, near family, and continued to design and manufacture his own high end jewelry line. He earned an American Gem Trade Association Spectrum Design Award for a bridal necklace in 2012. The new jewelry shop could easily fit into a larger city. “I like Wisconsin, I like the people, the seasons, the cost of living,” he said. “You may sell more elsewhere, but you have a higher overhead. I enjoy the customers here. They’re real.” Meanwhile, Rice said anyone who knew Slavens would be happy he has returned. “Everyone loves Craig,” she said. “He’s down to earth and very kind.” For more information: see Facebook or call 920-903-8716.

156,"Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, declared on Wednesday that there will be no possibility of restoring the nuclear deal until the United States lifts its sanctions against the country. The announcement comes as Iran prepares for presidential elections in a few months. The United States pulled out of the nuclear deal in 2018 under former President Donald Trump, re-imposing sanctions that have crippled Iran's already struggling economy. Iran has been demanding the lifting of these sanctions since President Joe Biden took office. However, negotiations between the two sides have been at a standstill, with each side refusing to make the first move. Iran has maintained that the United States must lift all sanctions before it will agree to talks.","Iran's supreme leader says world powers must lift international sanctions and not merely suspend them as part of a landmark nuclear agreement. Speaking to a group of clerics, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said ""there will be no deal"" if the sanctions are not lifted. His remarks were read by a state TV anchorman. Khamenei says some U.S. officials have spoken of the ""suspension"" of the sanctions, which he says is unacceptable. He says Iran will only partially comply with its commitments if the sanctions are merely suspended. U.S. President Barack Obama recently secured enough support to prevent the Republican-led Congress from blocking the deal. The agreement would curb Iran's nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief."

158,"The Madibaz rugby team ended their season on a high note with a hard-fought victory over the University of the Western Cape (UWC) on Saturday afternoon. The final score was 23-20, with the Madibaz showing their mettle in a game that was closely contested. The match took place at the Madibaz Stadium in Port Elizabeth, with both teams looking to end their season on a high note. The Madibaz started strongly, with winger Khwezi Mafu crossing the try line early on. However, UWC fought back and managed to score two tries of their own, taking a 14-10 lead into half-time. The second half was equally intense, with both teams battling hard for victory. The Madibaz managed to take control of the game, with flyhalf Simon Bolze kicking two crucial penalties to give them a narrow lead. UWC fought back, but it was not enough as the Madibaz held on for a memorable win. Madibaz coach Jarryd Buys praised his team for their resilient performance, saying: ""It was a great way to end the season. We knew it would be a tough game, but the boys showed great character and determination to come away with the win."" The Madibaz ended the season with five wins from their ten games, and will be looking to build on this next season.

The win for Madibaz at home was the perfect end to their Varsity Football campaign, despite not reaching the semifinals. Meanwhile, the visitors were hoping to end the competition on a high note. UWC did not need the points as they are already through to the semifinals. This was the Western Cape side’s first defeat in this year’s competition. Madibaz have had a nightmare of a season, having recorded two draws and suffering four consecutive defeats. Just five minutes into the game, UWC player Thulani Mkosi’s attempt at goal went wide. Mkosi kept on knocking in search of an opening goal for his side, but his shot was saved by Madibaz defender Lundi Balfour in the 13th minute. The home side opened the scoring when Cloudius Sagandira’s shot beat the UWC’s goalkeeper Reon October in the 20th minute. Two minutes later, Achuma Klass extended the score for the Madibaz to 2-0. After multiple attempts, UWC’s Mkosi finally found the back of the net just before half time. -Vuyokazi Nkanjeni The post appeared first on HeraldLIVE ."

With Sheridan's latest words of praise for the region, it's likely that even more people will be drawn to Gympie in the future - both for the music festival and to explore the town's beauty for themselves.","RANDOM Hugh Sheridan sightings during the filming of Boar last month set more than a few hearts aflutter in the Gympie region, and now the Aussie star has further endeared himself to our region by talking us up on national television. He told Larry Emdur and Kylie Gillies - and all of Australia - on The Morning Show last week that when he first heard he would be filming for the horror film near ""Gympie"" he asked ""where's Gympie?"" ""But we travelled around that region and it's actually really beautiful,"" he said in the interview. ""It's amazing."" Hugh went on to tell Larry and Kylie he spent all of his down time during the filming exploring the region, especially nearby coastal spots and, as a few lucky locals experienced, the local watering hole and shopping centre. The multi-talented ""nice bloke"" is also - serendipitously - the face of the Nestlé Choose Wellness Movement, which encourages Aussies to improve their lifestyle through a balanced diet, regular exercise and a positive attitude. The Nestle factory in Pine St is a large employer and industry in Gympie. Hugh described Boar in the Morning Show interview as a ""crazy, exciting horror film"" and said John Jarratt actually plays a ""nice guy"" in the film, whereas he (Hugh) plays a character everyone will hope gets killed. Hugh is home from the United States to lead the Nestlé Choose Wellness Roadshow from now until October 10. He became a household name playing Ben Rafter on Packed to the Rafters, but is also an accomplished singer, dancer and wildlife warrior, and will this year compete in the New York Marathon for the Australian Wildlife Conservancy. The Nestlé Choose Wellness survey asked people from across the nation about their emotional and physical well-being and discovered Baby Boomers were the most physically active of any other generation and were one-third more likely to do physical activity than other generations. The Movement ""is about you, making a choice today for a healthier tomorrow,"" Hugh says."

165,"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has called for an end to the Affordable Care Act's tax on high-cost health plans, also known as the Cadillac tax. The tax, which was set to take effect in 2018, was delayed until 2022 as part of a budget deal last December. Clinton made the comments during an interview with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, a union that has been vocal in its opposition to the Cadillac tax. Clinton said that while the Cadillac tax was originally intended to curb high healthcare costs, it has become clear that the tax will instead impact middle-class workers and families who have negotiated generous health plans through their unions. She called for the tax to be repealed or modified so that it does not unfairly burden working Americans. The Cadillac tax is a 40% excise tax on high-cost health plans, which are defined as plans that cost more than $10,200 for an individual or $27,500 for a family. The tax is intended to encourage employers to offer less expensive health plans and to discourage employees from using overly expensive plans. However, opponents of the Cadillac tax argue that the tax will hit middle-class workers and families the hardest, as they are more likely to have negotiated generous health plans through their unions. They also argue that the tax will lead to cuts in benefits and lower wages, as employers seek to avoid the tax. Clinton has previously expressed support for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. However, she has also called for improvements to the law, including a public option and measures to bring down healthcare costs. Clinton's call to end the Cadillac tax puts her at odds with President Obama, who has defended the tax as a necessary tool to control healthcare costs. However, several Democratic lawmakers have also called for the tax to be repealed or modified. Senator Bernie Sanders, who is challenging Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, has also called for the Cadillac tax to be repealed. Sanders has called the tax ""unfair"" and ""regressive."" The debate over the Cadillac tax is likely to continue as the 2016 presidential election approaches. While some Democrats continue to support the tax as a necessary tool to control healthcare costs, others, including Clinton and Sanders, argue that the tax unfairly burdens working Americans.","Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that Congress should repeal the unpopular ""Cadillac tax,"" an Obamacare tariff on premium health care plans. The tax is set to go into effect in 2018. Clinton said that while the Affordable Care Act -- one of President Barack Obama's top legislative achievements -- was ""working, plain and simple,"" there were some changes that needed to be made. ""I have proposed new reforms to build on the progress we've made and lower out-of-pocket costs for families,"" said Clinton in a statement. ""That's why, among other steps, I encourage Congress to repeal the so-called Cadillac tax, which applies to some employer-based health plans, and to fully pay for the cost of repeal."" Clinton said some of her proposed reforms to Obamacare, which she has rolled out in the past month, would more than cover the cost of repealing the Cadillac tax, a measure that helped to pay for the health care reform law. Clinton's campaign first said the candidate disapproved of the Cadillac tax during a call earlier this month with the American Federation of Teachers, a powerful union that has endorsed Clinton. The call was first reported Tuesday by The New York Times. Shortly after the story was published, Clinton's campaign released a statement calling on Congress to repeal the tax. Union members, many of whom enjoy the generous employer-based coverage plans, would be hit by the 40% tax, which applies to plans with yearly premiums exceeding $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers and a longtime Clinton supporter, praised the former secretary of state's decision. ""We are proud that Hillary Clinton has come out in favor of a repeal of the so-called Cadillac tax -- a harmful tax on health benefits that is hurting America's working families,"" she said. ""This tax already is being used by employers to shift an increasing share of health care costs to employees."" But many health care experts who view the tax as a crucial part of the Obamacare law are critical of Clinton's position. ""The smarter move is to leave well enough alone and allow this tax to take effect,"" said Jared Bernstein, a former White House economist and senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in a Washington Post op-ed earlier this year. ""After decades of fighting for it, we're finally moving towards a more rational, efficient health care system. Let's not screw that up."""
166,"The Albuquerque area can expect scattered clouds and a high of 85°F today, as reported by KRQE News. With little wind and low humidity, it's going to be a comfortable day to get outside and enjoy the fresh air. But don't forget to protect against the sun's harmful rays and drink plenty of water, as warm temperatures can still pose a risk of dehydration. According to the National Weather Service, scattered clouds will provide some respite from the intense sun throughout the day. However, it's important to remain vigilant as UV radiation can still be strong even on cloudy days. Sunscreen, hats, and sunglasses can help protect against the sun's harmful effects. The wind will be relatively light, blowing at around 5mph throughout the day, making it a great day for outdoor activities like hiking, biking, or simply enjoying a picnic in the park. However, it's important to remain aware of potential fire hazards, as dry conditions can increase the risk of wildfires. Always make sure to properly dispose of cigarettes and campfires, and avoid any activities that might accidentally start a fire. With a low humidity of only 24%, it's important to make sure to stay hydrated throughout the day. Drink plenty of water, and avoid drinking too much coffee, soda, or alcohol, which can actually dehydrate the body. It's also a good idea to take frequent breaks and rest in the shade if you start to feel too hot. The dewpoint is forecast to be around 44°F today, meaning that the air is relatively dry. This can lead to dry skin and other issues, so be sure to keep moisturizer handy if needed. The sunrise is expected to occur at 6:40 AM, providing plenty of daylight hours to enjoy the outdoors. Sunset is expected at 7:30 PM, so there will also be plenty of daylight left for evening activities. Overall, the weather conditions today are looking favorable for outdoor activities in the Albuquerque area. Scattered clouds, low wind, and dry conditions make for a comfortable day, though proper sun protection and hydration are still key. Take advantage of the beautiful weather and get outside to enjoy all that the area has to offer.","Amber Alert issued for missing 4-year-old boy [embedded content] Today's Regional Weather Forecasts ABQ - Rio Rancho East Mtns Santa Fe Northwest NM Southern CO Northeast NM Southwest NM Southeast NM Extended Forecasts [embedded content] Tropical moisture from tropical storm Kevin is going to be drawn into New Mexico over the next few days.

167,"La Grande, Oregon – The Eastern High School varsity soccer team faced a tough opponent in their first-ever match on Wednesday night. Despite their best efforts, they fell short against the seasoned veterans of the La Grande High School team. The game was held at the La Grande Stadium, and a large crowd turned out to see the first-ever game played by the Eastern team. However, the crowd was left disappointed as the Eastern team struggled to keep up with the experienced La Grande players. La Grande scored the first goal of the game within the first ten minutes of play, setting the tone for the rest of the match. Eastern fought bravely to equalize but struggled to break through the tenacious La Grande defense. La Grande added two more goals to their tally, finishing the game with a comfortable 3-0 win. Eastern, on the other hand, will need to regroup and work on their game plan before their next match. Despite the loss, the Eastern team showed tremendous potential and heart, and they will undoubtedly continue to improve with each game played.

In front of their home crowd, the Mountaineers put on a solid show and displayed what the future holds. About the only thing that didn’t go right was actually getting the ball in the net. Eastern controlled play for the majority of its season opener against Sierra Nevada College, generating countless scoring options. But the nerves of the first game cropped up at inopportune times, and it mustered just one goal in a 2-1 nonconference defeat at the EOU Soccer Field. “At the end of the day, the nerves got to us, I think,” Eastern head coach Stan Rodrigues said. “(Sierra Nevada) showed a lot of heart today, as well. But the jitters were definitely there. I didn’t sleep much last night, either.

Sarah Jones, a 32-year-old mother of two, has recently been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer that has left her shaken but determined to fight back.

Rob Davies, director of Yourlink Ltd, on Annie Reed Industrial Estate, will cycle across the Pyrenees from Biaritz to Argeles-sur-mer in order to raise cash for research into leukaemia and lymphoma. Describing himself as “a complete novice” when it comes to cycling, he has set himself a time limit of just six days for the journey in which he will ride uphill to a height of 13,000 metres. His late sister Alison Elliott was a top make-up artist in the film industry who died aged 47 just one week after being diagnosed with a rare form of leukaemia, and two weeks before her twins’ first birthday. Rob said: “Alison was a loving friend, sister, daughter, mother and wife, and I wanted to try and do something epic to raise money. “She was a very well-known and respected make-up designer having worked with many film stars from the likes of Emma Thompson to Michael Douglas. The film Nanny McPhee II was dedicated to her name.” Rob’s trip will take him from the Atlantic coast to the Mediterranean coast. But he won’t be alone because he’ll be accompanied on by the trip by work colleague Patrick Konrath, also a novice cyclist.

Our aim is to raise as much money as possible to help fund research towards this great cause, that affects around 30,000 people per year in the UK. “Our company is funding the cost of all equipment and travel expenses running in to well over £5,000, and all donations will go directly to the charity. “The challenge represents a huge one in more ways than one, and has required at least nine months of training up to 70 miles per day. “It will culminate in us climbing some of the largest peaks in the world, including many of the infamous climbs seen on television in the Tour de France.” Rob’s target is to raise £5000.

And, if you have a PC, your machine runs on a Microsoft operating system. Sound familiar? If it does, you’re in luck because the new Windows 10 is finally here and there are plenty of reasons to love this new operating system. “Microsoft combined the best features of Windows 7 and Windows 8,” says tech guru, Mario Armstrong. Windows 10 has been designed to offer you optimal performance on every device it runs so you can enjoy a Windows 7-like experience when using your computer or a Windows 8 experience on your mobile device. Windows 10 also offers a free personal assistant, built-in apps, increased photo and map capabilities and all the tools you need to manage your obligations with improved mail and calendar options, along with more opportunities to have some fun with movies, shows and music. So how do you transition to Windows 10? It’s easier than you think and to help you through the process, Armstrong offers these tips: * Back it up. Whether you decide to upgrade your current computer to Windows 10 or to buy a new Windows 10 powered device, it’s always a good idea to take some time and make sure all of your important files have been backed up. Get an external hard drive and use Microsoft’s free Backup and Restore software to copy all of your files over. This way, if something goes wrong, you’ll know everything is safe and sound. * Trust it to the professionals. Upgrading can be a scary process, since it’s possible to lose files or forget to uninstall certain drivers. Create your own safety net by taking advantage of the Staples EasyTech program and a knowledgeable Staples associate will upgrade your computer to Windows 10 for free. Just call or head into a local store to make an appointment and you’ll be running Windows 10 in no time. Any device running Windows 7 or later is eligible. * Find the right device for your new operating system. Before you enact a Windows 10 upgrade, you need to figure out if you’ll be upgrading your current computer or transitioning to a new device. The good news is if your current laptop, tablet or hybrid device runs Windows 7 or Windows 8 already, it can probably handle Windows 10’s system requirements, but you should double check to make sure. If your computer barely meets the minimum requirements but runs fine, you should hold off on upgrading until you can afford a new device. Even though Windows 10 is free for most people, adding it to an older device may slow the device down. You can learn more about upgrading for free from Microsoft’s site. For PC users, Windows 10 offers them the chance to use and enjoy their devices like never before and upgrading is easy. Simply follow Armstrong’s tips before you upgrade and visit your local Staples store for help. Then, your old companion will have a new and exciting look and feel in no time."
175,"The Department of Human Services in Pennsylvania is set to introduce innovative changes to its Medicaid program. The changes were announced by the Department of Human Services Secretary, Teresa Miller, who revealed that the new initiative would expand access to care, improve health outcomes, and streamline administrative processes. The new changes to the Medicaid program come as Pennsylvania continues to grapple with the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Secretary Miller noted that the pandemic had highlighted the urgent need to improve access to quality healthcare for all Pennsylvanians, particularly those in vulnerable and under-served communities. Under the new initiative, Medicaid recipients in Pennsylvania will have more options for accessing care, including the use of telehealth services. Secretary Miller said that telehealth had become increasingly important during the pandemic as patients and healthcare providers searched for ways to safely deliver and receive care. The changes to Medicaid in Pennsylvania will also incorporate new technology and analytics tools to help healthcare providers identify and address healthcare needs more efficiently. By streamlining and optimizing administrative processes, healthcare providers will be able to spend more time focused on delivering quality care to their patients. One of the most significant changes announced by Secretary Miller is the expansion of Medicaid coverage to include smoking cessation services for pregnant women. According to the Department of Human Services, smoking during pregnancy is one of the leading causes of infant mortality in Pennsylvania. By expanding access to proven smoking cessation programs, the state aims to improve health outcomes for mothers and newborns. The Department of Human Services in Pennsylvania is also working with insurers to create a new payment model for Medicaid. The model will be based on value-based care rather than traditional fee-for-service payment structures. Value-based care incentivizes healthcare providers to focus on delivering quality care instead of simply performing more services. The new payment model is expected to reduce healthcare costs in Pennsylvania while also improving the quality of care provided to Medicaid recipients. By shifting the focus to value-based care, healthcare providers will be able to address the root causes of health issues, rather than just treating the symptoms. Secretary Miller said that the Department of Human Services is committed to improving access to quality healthcare for all Pennsylvanians. ""The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged us all to rethink the way we deliver healthcare,"" she said. ""But it has also presented us with an opportunity to implement innovative solutions that will improve health outcomes and reduce costs."" The changes to Pennsylvania's Medicaid program come as other states are also reevaluating their healthcare systems in the wake of the pandemic. The pandemic has highlighted the disparities in access to quality healthcare across the country, particularly for under-served and vulnerable communities. The Department of Human Services in Pennsylvania believes that the changes to its Medicaid program will help to bridge the gap in healthcare access and improve health outcomes for all Pennsylvanians. The implementation of telehealth services and the new payment model based on value-based care will empower healthcare providers to deliver quality care to their patients and improve health outcomes across the state. In conclusion, the Department of Human Services in Pennsylvania is set to introduce innovative changes to its Medicaid program that will expand access to care, improve health outcomes, and streamline administrative processes. The changes come in response to the urgent need to improve access to quality healthcare for all Pennsylvanians, particularly those in vulnerable and under-served communities. Through the implementation of telehealth services, analytics tools, and a new payment model based on value-based care, the Department of Human Services aims to improve health outcomes and reduce costs across the state.","From the Wires Changes Emphasize Outcome-based Payments and Community-based Care Sep. 16, 2015 01:42 PM HARRISBURG, Pa. , Sept 16, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Department of Human Services (DHS) Secretary Ted Dallas today announced two major steps in the Department's effort to spur innovation and better care in Medicaid. Governor Tom Wolf launched Pennsylvania's Medicaid expansion plan in April 2015 . Since the launch, more than 200,000 new Pennsylvanians have enrolled in HealthChoices, which now provides health care coverage to more Pennsylvanians than ever before. ""When fully implemented, these new changes will mark the most significant changes to Medicaid in Pennsylvania since the Department first moved to mandatory managed care 18 years ago,"" said Secretary Dallas. ""We must continue to innovate and move forward if we are going to provide the high-quality health care that all Pennsylvanians deserve. As the biggest insurance payor in the commonwealth, our hope is that these changes will encourage innovation in the private sector as well."" First, DHS issued a request for proposals (RFP) for physical health services provided through HealthChoices, Pennsylvania's mandatory Medicaid managed care program since 1997. ""If you pay for services, you will get services. If you pay for outcomes, you will get outcomes,"" said Dallas. ""When awarded, the contracts will require the managed care organizations (MCOs) to increase the amount of money they spend on contracts that reward value, care coordination, and better health outcomes rather than simply paying for services as they are provided. The result will be a system that focuses more on the patient as a whole and provides higher quality care to those in the Medicaid system."" To drive Pennsylvania's Medicaid system towards these better outcomes, the new contracts will set targets for all contracted MCOs to increase the percentage of value-based or outcome-based contracts they have with hospitals, doctors, and other providers to 30 percent of medical funds they receive from DHS within three years. The result will be that billions of dollars will be invested in options such as: accountable care organizations (voluntary networks of hospitals, doctors, and other providers that work together to provide coordinated care to patients); bundled payments (increases value-based purchasing); patient-centered medical homes; and other performance-based payments. The contracts will also include better integration of the physical and behavioral health systems and approaches like telemedicine to help serve areas of the state that do not have easy access to doctors. Second, DHS, in partnership with the Pennsylvania Department of Aging, released a more detailed concept paper outlining its vision for Community HealthChoices (CHC), Governor Tom Wolf's managed long-term services and supports program to support older individuals and adults with physical disabilities ( click here for the release regarding the concept paper). The plan is an integrated system of physical health and long-term services and supports (LTSS) which focuses on improving health outcomes and allowing individuals to live safe and healthy lives with as much independence as possible. CHC is a significant shift from the commonwealth's current, fractured approach to providing these services and will enhance care for seniors and persons with disabilities through better coordination of care. The result will be that more Pennsylvanians will be served in the community instead of in nursing homes or other facilities. CHC will support individuals dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, older adults and adults with physical disabilities in the most integrated settings possible. CHC will serve an estimated 450,000 individuals, including 130,000 older persons and adults with physical disabilities who are currently receiving LTSS in the community and in nursing facilities. HealthChoices delivers quality medical care and timely access to all appropriate services to 2.5 million children, individuals with disabilities, pregnant women, and low-income Pennsylvanians.

176,"As the National Football League (NFL) gears up for the upcoming season, the league is ramping up the technology at stadiums to provide a more enhanced and immersive game-day experience for fans. From virtual reality (VR) activations to in-seat food ordering, the technological advancements are designed to help ease the inconvenience of long lines and waiting times commonly experienced during game-days. One major enhancement is the expansion of 5G network infrastructure in stadiums. The NFL has partnered with major wireless carriers to ensure stadiums are equipped with the latest 5G technology, providing reliable and high-speed connections to fans. This means that fans can seamlessly stream the game, connect with social media, and access important information about the game. Virtual Reality (VR) is also making its way into game-day experiences. The NFL recently launched a VR experience that allows fans to feel as if they are on the field next to their favorite players. Fans can explore areas of the stadium typically inaccessible to the public, like the locker rooms or even flyover views of the stadium. This technology is also being implemented in player training; teams can utilize VR to simulate game-day scenarios to train their players. Ordering food and drinks can now be done right from your seat in some stadiums. The NFL has partnered with various companies to develop mobile apps that allow fans to conveniently order food and beverage items from their seat. Once the order is placed, fans can track their delivery status in real-time and receive notifications when their order is ready for pick-up. Stadiums are also using artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the fan experience. By utilizing advanced algorithms and data analytics to better understand the needs of fans, stadiums can personalize their offerings. This includes things like suggesting food and drink options, providing recommendations on merchandise or even helping fans find the shortest lines for restrooms or concessions. Facial recognition technology is another advancement that is being implemented in some stadiums. Fans can now use facial recognition software to quickly and easily enter the stadium without having to worry about traditional forms of identification. This technology can help to reduce the time and wait times, making it easier for fans to enter the stadium and get to their seats on time. In conclusion, the NFL is utilizing technology to enhance the fan experience like never before. The expansion of 5G infrastructure, VR experiences, AI personalization, and in-seat ordering are just a few of the advancements making their way into stadiums. This investment in technology is set to not only streamline game-day operations but also ensure fans leave with a more immersive and unforgettable stadium experience.","The Dallas Cowboys set the standard for technologically advanced NFL stadiums. The challenge to keep that unofficial title could be as tough as getting to the Super Bowl. With new ballparks to debut in Minneapolis next year and Atlanta in 2017, keeping up with what fans want from technology is an endless process for NFL teams. ''We try to do that every year, have a new offering, whether through our app or experiential,'' says Charlotte Jones Anderson, the Cowboys' executive vice president and chief brand officer. ''This year, we have a DraftKings fantasy sports lounge for our fans interested in playing and engaging in fantasy football.'' Because AT&T is a partner and has naming rights to the Cowboys' building, Anderson believes the team has an edge in the tech world. Another corporate giant, IBM is helping design and implement the technology for the Falcons' new home. IBM is trying to make sure the infrastructure for Mercedes-Benz Stadium doesn't need to be replaced as technology advances. ''It's critical to have future flexibility over time,'' says John Armstrong, North American leader for IBM interactive experience. But it takes more than strong Wi-Fi to make football fans leave their living rooms and big screen TVs to pay for expensive tickets, parking and concessions at the stadium. . The Cowboys think their fan app is a difference maker. It provides traffic updates, best routes into the parking lots, directions to your seat and ticket management. Fans can provide instant feedback when there is an issue such as long lines at the gates or rest room/concession problems. The team has added touchscreens in the stadium on which fans can look up player bios, the history of the Cowboys cheerleaders, or descriptions of the stadium's art collection. It's easier than ever to gauge what the fans want technologically, because they let teams know through social media. Many new of the Atlanta stadium's new accoutrements are based on fan feedback. ''To really have the lens of the fan as the guide is challenging,'' IBM's Armstrong says. ''Certainly there are lots of things we can do technology-wise, but if you don't have the lens of the fan in mind you could almost get carried away, doing things for the sake of technological things. But the question you always must be able to answer is: Does this add to the enjoyment of the event and the experience of the fan, or is it a whiz-bang trick that is distracting?'' Falcons owner Arthur Blank has said that what the fan will experience on the first day for his stadium in 2017 will not be the same experience the next year. New stats might provide instant analysis to fans' seats. New technologies might allow new ways for fans to see or share content. How teams deliver that info at the games could be crucial to getting fans into the seats. ''They are there to see a live event and that is, foremost, the football game,'' Armstrong says. ''The Falcons and many other sports organizations are supremely focused on what it takes to create the depth for engaging their fans - to have that mindshare of the fan and the consumer.'' --- AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP-NFL"
177,"On Tuesday, MacroCure Ltd saw its shares dip 5.3% as the biotech company announced disappointing results from its clinical trial for its flagship treatment, CureXcell. The Phase III study examined the effectiveness of CureXcell, a cell-based therapy designed to heal chronic wounds, such as diabetic foot ulcers, in comparison to standard care. Unfortunately, the results showed that there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of wound size reduction. MacroCure CEO Nissim Mashiach expressed disappointment in the outcome of the trial, stating that the company will continue to analyze the data to determine if there are any sub-populations that may benefit from the treatment. Mashiach also noted that the company will continue to pursue regulatory approval for CureXcell in Israel and India, where the treatment has already been granted additional patents. Despite the setback, MacroCure still has several ongoing clinical trials for CureXcell and other treatments, including an additional Phase III trial for diabetic foot ulcers currently ongoing in the United States. Furthermore, the company recently announced a collaboration with the tissue engineering company CollPlant to develop a 3D printable implant using collagen combined with MacroCure's cell therapy. The implant is intended to provide structural support and aid in tissue regeneration in various conditions, such as tendinopathy and cartilage damage. Investors, however, have not responded positively to the news of the trial's results. MacroCure's stock has fallen to $2.67 per share, a 52-week low. The company's market cap now stands at $46.18 million, down from over $100 million at the beginning of the year. MacroCure's financials have also been a cause for concern. In the second quarter of 2021, the company reported a net loss of $2.2 million, compared to a net loss of $1.9 million in the same period last year. The company's revenue for the quarter was $301,000, compared to $364,000 in the same period in 2020. Despite these challenges, MacroCure remains committed to developing innovative treatments to improve patient outcomes. The company will likely face additional scrutiny from investors and regulators moving forward, but with a strong pipeline and partnerships in place, MacroCure may still have the potential to recover from this setback.","Macrocure (NASDAQ:MCUR)’s share price traded down 5.3% during trading on Monday , MarketBeat.Com reports.

178,"As a parent, you undoubtedly want the best for your child. You want them to succeed in school and in life. However, there are certain behaviors and habits that unwittingly sabotage your child’s chances of academic success. Here are 10 ways you could be helping your child fail in school, without even realizing it. 1. Lack of structure Children thrive on routine and predictability, and a lack of structure can hinder their ability to concentrate and focus on their studies. Set a regular bedtime, wake-up time, and schedule for homework and other activities. 2. Lack of communication Communication is essential to foster a positive relationship with your child. Make time to talk, actively listen, validate their feelings and offer support. 3. Overprotectiveness An overprotective parent can hinder their child's growth and independence. Give your child the space, autonomy, and responsibility to make their own decisions, and learn from their mistakes. 4. Inconsistent rules Rules and boundaries are essential for your child's behavior and growth. Establish clear and consistent rules, and enforce consequences when necessary. 5. Ignoring warning signs Ignoring warning signs of stress, anxiety, and other mental health issues can hamper your child's academic performance. Be aware of any changes in your child's behavior, mood, or grades, and seek professional help if necessary. 6. Overemphasizing grades Grades do not define your child's worth or intelligence, be wary to not overemphasize or obsess over them. Celebrate their achievements, and focus on the learning process, progress, and effort. 7. Micromanaging Micromanaging your child's academic life can cause unnecessary stress and hinder their learning experience. Let your child take ownership of their studies, but offer guidance, support, and encouragement when needed. 8. Lack of engagement Engage in your child's academic life and activities by attending parent-teacher conferences, volunteering in the classroom, attending extracurricular activities, and providing a supportive learning environment at home. 9. Criticizing instead of constructive feedback Criticism can undermine your child's self-confidence and motivation. Instead, offer constructive feedback, positive reinforcement, and encourage their strengths and abilities. 10. Not setting an example Children learn by example. Be a role model for your child by practicing good communication, time-management, healthy lifestyle choices, continuous learning opportunities, and a growth mindset. Conclusion In summary, promoting a positive and supportive learning environment at home, avoiding overprotectiveness or micromanagement, and modeling a growth mindset are great ways to help your child succeed academically. By avoiding these common mistakes, you can ensure your child's success and happiness in school and beyond.","School can be difficult. But are you encouraging or hindering your child's success? Here are 10 habits you may not realize are damaging to his or her success in school. 1. Forget about tomorrow morning. Let her stay up late! It’s not like she needs a full nights’ rest to do well in school; she can sleep in her desk! Besides, she hates bedtime and it’s so much easier to let her stay up with you and watch some of those funny late night television shows. 2. Don’t ask her about her homework every day or how school is going. You don’t want to be a nag. She’s probably got it all figured out and will get great grades without your getting involved. 3. Don’t worry about grades until a week or two before they come out. You have plenty of time! Your schedule is too busy anyway to be bogged down with your child’s education. If she misses class or a few assignments here and there, the teacher will gladly accept them until the last day of the term and if he doesn’t, you can just call the principal and she’ll sort it all out. 4. Yell at your child until she gets her homework done. Ground her and take away her cell phone. That’s how you really get someone motivated to work hard. If she complains, tell her you walked to school uphill both ways in the snow with no shoes; she’ll quickly realize that she’s being ungrateful and get right to work. 5. Don’t worry about attending Parent-Teacher Conference. That teacher couldn’t have anything helpful to say about how she is doing in his class. After all, what did he do with his life? He’s just a teacher. He better just shape up and do what you say, after all; you’re the parent and you pay taxes. 6. Whenever she has a doctor or dentist appointment, be sure to make that appointment during her hardest class. It will give her a much needed break and it’s not like you’re worried about her making up the work. That’s the teacher’s problem, not yours. 7. Don’t worry about whether your child has breakfast before she heads to school. School is early enough; it’s not worth getting up earlier to make breakfast. Besides, it’s not like learning is a bodily function; it’s more of a brain function. Page 2 of 2 - 8. Don’t praise your child if she does something well in school; it will just go to her head. Your job is to motivate her by pointing out only the things she does wrong. After all, if you don’t say it, who will? 9. If you have a complaint, always go straight to the top! Principals love to get involved in every little situation; that’s why they’re called princi-“pals.” 10. Don’t worry about setting a good example of continued learning. You already went to school! Been there, done that. You have too much work to do now to fit in reading a good book or showing your child that you still love art. Never talk about what inspired you to get where you are today; that will just bore her."
179,"Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos announced on Wednesday plans to take his space venture Blue Origin to the next level by building rockets that will be launched from his private launch site in Florida. Bezos, who is also the owner of The Washington Post, tweeted an image of a futuristic-looking rocket that will carry cargo, satellites and people to space. The new rocket, named New Glenn after Mercury astronaut John Glenn, will be larger than Blue Origin's previous rocket vehicle, the New Shepard. It will stand at 270 feet tall, which is the same height as the Saturn V rocket that carried humans to the moon during the Apollo missions. The new rocket will be powered by seven BE-4 engines, developed by the Blue Origin team in partnership with United Launch Alliance. According to Bezos, the rocket will have the capability to travel to low Earth orbit, geostationary transfer orbit and cislunar orbit. The rocket will make its debut launch from Florida's Space Coast by the end of the decade. In a press release, Bezos said that the new rocket will have ""unmatched payload capabilities"" and will be able to carry ""essentially any size payload to orbit."" He added that the New Glenn will also have a reusable first stage, which will enable Blue Origin to significantly reduce the cost of space launches. Bezos is not the only entrepreneur investing in space ventures. Elon Musk's SpaceX, Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic and Paul Allen's Stratolaunch are among other private companies vying for a slice of the space industry. However, Bezos believes that Blue Origin has a unique advantage in the industry. ""We're not just going to space to visit,"" Bezos wrote in an email to The New York Times. ""We're going there to colonize."" With the launch of the New Glenn, Bezos and Blue Origin may have a chance to become a major player in the space industry.","In a new expansion of commercial efforts to launch earthlings into space, Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos plans to build rockets on Florida's Space Coast — in an area he calls ""a gateway to humankind's greatest adventures."" Speaking at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Bezos outlined a new chapter for Blue Origin , the private aerospace company he founded more than a decade ago. He also described how he caught ""the space bug"" by watching Saturn V rockets launch from the cape's famed launch site. Those launch pads have been dormant for 10 years, Bezos said, adding that it's ""too long — we can't wait to fix that,"" in a comment that drew applause from the crowd. Blue Origin will work toward putting people into orbit around the Earth from Cape Canaveral, relying on reusable orbital launchers that will be built in Florida. The American-made BE-4 rocket engines that Blue Origin plans to use will also be tested at the facility. At today's event, the billionaire Bezos was accompanied by Gov. Rick Scott and Sen. Bill Nelson — who flew into space aboard the space shuttle in the 1980s — along with other officials and guest speakers. By committing to base its operations in Florida, Blue Origin will create 330 jobs and add more than $200 million into the local economy, Scott said. More than 10 other states had been competing to become the site of the Blue Origin expansion, officials said Tuesday. Bezos did not discuss when the first launches might take place. Blue Origin recently said that it hopes to qualify the engine for flight in 2017, with the first flight of the Vulcan rocket system planned for two years later. The company says that testing of the BE-4 engine has been underway ""for more than three years and testing of the BE-4 components is ongoing at Blue Origin's test facilities in West Texas."" In April, Blue Origin carried out the first test flight of its reusable New Shepard space vehicle at its Texas facility."
180,"The Republican party is experiencing division as the possibility of a government shutdown looms in the House of Representatives. The disagreement centers around the issue of government funding for a border wall. Some conservative lawmakers are pushing for the inclusion of funding in the upcoming budget bill, arguing that it is a crucial measure necessary for national security. However, their moderate counterparts believe it is an unnecessary expense, and that the money would be better spent elsewhere. This rift within the party has become increasingly apparent, with Republican leadership scrambling to come up with a solution that will prevent a government shutdown. If no agreement is reached, funding for a number of government agencies and services could be put on hold. The fight over government funding for a border wall intensifies as both sides hold their ground. President Trump has been pushing for the inclusion of funding for the wall since his presidential campaign, stating that it is essential to protecting the country's borders. He has even claimed that Mexico will pay for the wall, though the Mexican government has denied this. Republican leadership is struggling to find a way to move forward, knowing that any decision they make will have far-reaching consequences. The government shutdown in 2013 cost the U.S. economy an estimated $24 billion and caused widespread disruption. While the deadline for the budget bill is December 7th, the controversy over the border wall funding could cause delays, leading to a last-minute scramble to avoid a shutdown. The failure to pass a budget bill could cause significant damage to the Republican party's reputation, especially in the lead-up to the 2020 election. This is a key issue that both parties will likely continue to fight over in the coming weeks. In the end, it remains unclear how the issue of government funding for a border wall will be resolved. For now, both sides are at an impasse, with the December 7th deadline rapidly approaching. It seems that the coming weeks will be crucial for the future of the Republican party's cohesion as lawmakers try to find a solution to this pressing issue.","On Thursday, with 13 days left in the fiscal year, the president met at the White House with Democratic congressional leaders – Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. – signaling that the Democrats were taking the shutdown possibility seriously, even as they revel in the GOP dysfunction. Reid and Pelosi met with Obama to prepare for negotiations. They say they are willing to back a stopgap measure to keep open the government, but insisted it be short term and not include any language about ideological issues, such as funding Planned Parenthood. Pelosi said the emphasis now is reaching a deal quickly. “We’re optimistic, we want to be cooperative,” Pelosi said. “We want to negotiate in good faith to see that effectively done in a timely fashion.” But with only seven working days on the legislative calendar, GOP feuding has prevented any real negotiation on a funding package. On Thursday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said congressional Republicans had “shown no interest” in talks with congressional Democrats and accused them of “irresponsible gamesmanship.” Ahead of the White House meeting, Pelosi told reporters that she and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, had not begun talks: “I spoke with Speaker Boehner about when we would speak about this,” she said. The lack of communication sets up a replay of the 2013 showdown, which led to a 16-day shutdown. This year’s shutdown dynamics are driven by an internal GOP feud in the House in which a group of hard-line conservatives are promising mutiny against Boehner if they the perceive any capitulation in his dealing with the Democrats. On Thursday, Bohner’s top deputy. Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, was forced to address the acrimony inside the GOP caucus. He told reporters that the conservatives who wanted to oust Boehner were distracting and dividing Republicans during negotiations with Democrats. The danger to Boehner lies in the insistence of some in his party that he not allow any funding package for the federal government if it includes funding for Planned Parenthood, the provider of health services to women recently embroiled in controversy over fetal tissue harvesting."
181,"Chinese search engine giant Baidu has launched its own virtual assistant, the Duer AI assistant, which will take on the likes of Siri and Google Now. Duer AI will be available on a range of devices from smartphones to wearables and will be powered by Baidu's machine learning technology. Duer AI will not only serve as a voice-activated personal assistant but also as an intelligent search tool. The AI assistant will be able to recognize natural language commands, understand user preferences and past behavior to provide personalized recommendations and perform tasks such as booking movie tickets or ordering food. The assistant will also be able to integrate with third-party services, enabling users to access additional features through Duer AI. Baidu's move into the virtual assistant space follows a growing trend of tech companies investing heavily in artificial intelligence. Google has been enhancing its own virtual assistant, Google Now, with machine learning capabilities, while Apple's Siri has also become smarter in recent years. According to Baidu's vice-president, the company's foray into the AI assistant market is a natural continuation of its core business, as it already has experience in natural language processing, image recognition and search. Duer AI is still in the beta stage and will initially only be available in China, but Baidu plans to expand the assistant's capabilities and make it available in other markets in the future.","Chinese giant Baidu is getting in on the phone personal assistant game with the launch of Duer, marking a major improvement on the previous system launched on the Baidu app three years ago. The post appeared first on Silicon… Chinese giant Baidu is getting in on the phone personal assistant game with the launch of Duer, marking a major improvement on the previous system launched on the Baidu app three years ago. Baidu’s Duer, which effectively translates to ‘Du Secretary’ was given a major demonstration with aims of using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to challenge the systems developed by Apple and Google. Much has been made of its development considering that one of the driving forces behind its machine learning technology is world-renowned expert in the field, Andrew Ng, who joined the company back in 2014. Much like its competitors, Baidu’s Duer is working towards allowing the user to place orders online with services like buying cinema tickets or ordering takeaway food. According to Tech In Asia, this first step into AI will be expanded into allowing for other services including hailing a taxi and ordering other online goods. Perhaps most interestingly, it is hoped Duer will engage with the internet of things (IoT) home by allowing it to control devices in the home as well as connect them with a healthcare provider.

182,"Three fraudsters have been jailed for their role in a £2.6m scam at a Channel Island airport. The trio was found guilty of money laundering and fraud after a four-week trial at the Old Bailey. The scam involved creating fake companies and invoices to defraud Guernsey airport between 2012 and 2016. The trio not only managed to extract cash from the airport, but also spent large sums on luxury cars, expensive jewellery and exotic holidays. During the trial, the court heard how the three fraudsters – 46-year-old Tony Reynolds, 40-year-old Antony O'Donnell, and 38-year-old Simon Spence – set up a shell company called ""Islands Airports Limited"" to receive payments. They then invoiced the airport for work that was never completed, using forged invoices and false names. The trio also created a fake company email address, which they used to correspond with the airport's finance department. The Crown Prosecution Service said that the scam was ""sophisticated"" and ""elaborate"", adding that the defendants went to ""great lengths"" to cover their tracks. The trio was sentenced to a total of 16 years and four months in prison, with Reynolds receiving a seven-year sentence, O'Donnell receiving a five-year sentence and Spence receiving four years and four months. In addition to the jail term, the trio was also ordered to pay back the £2.6m they had stolen from the airport. Following the sentencing, Guernsey Airport managing director Colin Le Ray said: ""It has been a long and complex investigation, but we are pleased to see justice has been done. We would like to reassure our customers, stakeholders and the general public that we have learnt from this and it is very unlikely that such an incident could happen again."" The case highlights the importance of vigilance in the battle against fraud. It is vital that businesses have strong controls in place to prevent such scams from taking place.","Two fraudsters who laundered £2.6 million meant for a new Channel Island airport runway have been sent to prison. John Woodhatch, aged 58, of Boleyn Court in Buckhurst Hill, was sent to prison for five years for his part in a “payment diversion” fraud on the States of Guernsey. Adrian Taylor, 44, from Swanley in Kent, was also jailed for six years when the pair appeared at the Old Bailey last Wednesday (September 9) having both pleaded guilty to money laundering. The duo contacted the Guernsey Treasury in June 2012 claiming to be from Lagan Construction, which is carrying out a £50 million project at the island’s airport. The pair told the treasury that they wanted to change the bank account details into which monthly payments were being made. Once this was agreed and the latest monthly payment of £2.6 million had been transferred into the new RBS account, Woodhatch, who was working as a City broker, immediately instructed the bank to move the funds to accounts in Dubai and Turkey. Woodhatch told RBS the transfers were mainly to pay for a horse in Dubai, but the bank’s money laundering team was not convinced and referred the matter to the City of London Police in July 2012. After several days, Woodhatch was arrested and his home and commercial address in the city were searched. A review of the accounts found that £52,000 of the stolen funds had been transferred to Taylor, who was arrested in October 2012 after he handed himself in to police. Detective Inspector Rob Stirling, who led the investigation for the City of London Police, said: “Woodhatch and Taylor thought they were too smart to be caught and would be left free to spend the £2.6 million stolen from the States of Guernsey. Share article “Unfortunately for them the City of London Police specialises in investigating cases of financial fraud and bringing those responsible to justice. “Woodhatch and Taylor’s scam should also serve as a warning to other public and private sector bodies that could easily be targeted by fraudsters in the same way.”"

184,"Natera, a leading company in genetic testing and diagnostics, is now able to more efficiently deliver its non-invasive genetic screening technology services thanks to its bolstering of broadband service. The increase in broadband service capacity will allow Natera to more quickly and reliably transmit large amounts of genetic data and improve the delivery of test results to physicians and patients alike. With more efficient delivery of its genetic screening technology services, Natera can provide patients with results in as little as five days, saving valuable time in the diagnostic process. This announcement comes at a time when genetic screening and diagnostic services are more in demand than ever before. With the COVID-19 pandemic putting more emphasis on health and wellness, patients are seeking out genetic testing options to better understand their own health and genetic makeup. Natera's non-invasive genetic screening technology services help patients understand their risk for certain genetic conditions, such as cancer and heart disease. The company's advanced technology is able to detect very small amounts of fetal DNA in a woman's blood, allowing for the identification of genetic variants that can increase the risk of certain conditions. Not only does this technology lead to more accurate and earlier diagnosis, but it also reduces the need for invasive diagnostic procedures such as amniocentesis, which can carry a risk of miscarriage. Natera's genetic screening technology services are particularly important for patients who have a family history of certain genetic conditions or who are considered high risk due to their age or other factors. And with the company's increased broadband service, these critical services can now be delivered in a more efficient and timely manner. This is not the first time that Natera has made advances in the field of genetic testing. The company has been a pioneer in non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) since 2011 and has continued to innovate in this area with its recent launch of the Panorama® prenatal screening test. The Panorama test offers expanded genetic screening and diagnostic capabilities, including the ability to detect atypical X and Y chromosomes that can indicate certain genetic conditions. This test is particularly important for patients who may have limited access to genetic testing due to financial or geographic reasons. Natera's advances in genetic screening technology have not gone unnoticed. In fact, the company was recently recognized by Frost & Sullivan as the 2021 Global Technology Innovation Leader in the non-invasive prenatal testing industry. This recognition speaks to the company's reputation for innovation and its dedication to advancing the field of genetic testing and diagnostics. With its recent increase in broadband service, Natera is primed to continue delivering cutting-edge genetic screening technology services to patients around the world. As genetic testing becomes increasingly important in the diagnostic process, Natera's advances in technology and service delivery will play a vital role in ensuring patients receive the care they need in a timely and efficient manner.","Increased capacity and speed through Comcast Business Services enhances Natera's ability to access cloud-based analytical software SAN CARLOS, Calif., Sept. 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Comcast Business today announced that Natera, Inc., a leader in non-invasive genetic testing, has upgraded its Comcast Business Ethernet services to more efficiently run its portfolio of genetic tests.

189,"The Kaneland Knights varsity soccer team secured their first win of the season Wednesday night against the Genoa-Kingston Cogs in a hard-fought battle that lasted until the final whistle. The final score of the game was 2-1 in favor of the Knights, marking an important milestone for the team after a challenging start to their season. The first half of the game was evenly matched, with both teams exchanging possessions and shots on goal. The Knights came close to scoring a few times, but their efforts were ultimately thwarted by the Cogs' defense. The score remained tied at 0-0 until just before halftime, when the Cogs managed to break through the Knights' defense and score the first goal of the game. The Knights came out strong in the second half, determined to even the score. Their hard work paid off just minutes into the half, as senior captain Jack Smith managed to score the tying goal off of a well-placed assist from midfielder Alex Rodriguez. The goal energized the Knights and spurred them on to play with even greater intensity in the remainder of the game. With time ticking down, it looked like the game might end in a tie. However, with just minutes to spare, freshman forward Noah Sanchez scored the game-winning goal off of a brilliant pass from defender Nate Franklin. The Knights' defense held strong in the remaining minutes of the game to secure the win and give the team a much-needed boost of confidence. After the game, Knights head coach Ryan Doyle praised his team for their perseverance and determination in securing the win. ""We knew coming into this game that it was going to be tough, and the Cogs gave us a run for our money,"" he said. ""But our players stayed focused and kept fighting until the very end. I'm proud of what they accomplished tonight."" The win is a welcome relief for the Knights, who have had a tough start to their season. They lost their first two games to tough opponents and were struggling to find their rhythm. But the victory over the Cogs shows that the team has what it takes to compete at a high level and that their hard work is paying off. The Knights will look to build on this win in their upcoming games and continue to improve throughout the rest of the season. With strong leadership from their captains and talented players throughout the lineup, they are confident that they can turn their season around and make a run at the playoffs.","KANELAND—A busy week that saw some positives and negatives culminated with the first victory of the season for the Kaneland boys soccer team. The Knights (1-3-1) blanked Hinckley-Big Rock, 3-0, on Friday afternoon in Maple Park. “It felt really good to get that one, and the boys needed that, especially after playing against so many tough teams,” Knights coach Scott Parillo said. “They had a little more time and were able to create some scoring chances.” Javier Correa scored twice on headers to pace the Knights to the win. Rain forced a postponement of two games on Aug. 29 so the Knights made up their game against Jacobs on Thursday. Once again, weather played a factor, shortening the game, but it didn’t affect the outcome as Jacobs won handily, 4-1. Trevor Jahns accounted for Kaneland’s lone goal in a game that was called in the 62nd minute due to weather. “It was not one of our better games,” Parillo said. “We certainly didn’t play well in the second half, so I was a little nervous to how we were going to respond on Friday. We played a brutal second half (against Jacobs).” The Knights started the week with a hard-earned 1-1 tie against Class 3A Dundee-Crown. Jahns gave the Knights an early lead with 13:48 left in the first half, but Dundee-Crown responded with a goal from Jelani Washington just a little more than three minutes later to knot things at 1-1. Neither team could break the tie. “We didn’t have as many chances as they did, although we had some nice chances at the end,” Parillo said. “We’re not playing any powder puff teams though, and this was a good team. I keep telling our guys that it’s going to be a long season if we don’t realize that.” The schedule doesn’t get any easier for the Knights this week. They were scheduled to travel to DeKalb on Tuesday, and they’ll be at Sycamore this afternoon. “We’ve played well against West Aurora, Dundee-Crown and now Hinckley,” Parillo said. “It could’ve been higher against Hinckley, but we didn’t convert. We don’t have any gimme games, so these have all been a good test for us, good for our resolve and mental toughness.” The Knights also haven’t been at full strength for much of the season. Angel Escontrias left Tuesday’s game against Dundee-Crown with an injury and hasn’t played since, although he’s expected back soon. Drew Franklin also has missed some games due to his dual duty as the football team’s placekicker. He booted a pair of PATs last Friday, but also missed a field goal. “Like I’ve told the kids many times, we’ve got to keep improving,” Parillo said. “It’s not how you start but how you finish. We haven’t hit our stride yet, and have an ugly record once again at the beginning, but we had that last year too and won a regional.”"

192,"A recent study published in the journal BMC Public Health suggests that reducing sitting time may be more important than increasing exercise levels for improving overall health. The study, which followed 230 inactive adults for six months, found that participants who reduced their sitting time by an hour per day had a lower risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Meanwhile, those who increased their exercise levels by an hour per day showed no significant health benefits. Lead author of the study, Dr. Genevieve Healy from the University of Queensland, explained that while exercise is important, reducing sedentary behavior should also be a priority for individuals looking to improve their health. ""By simply reducing the amount of time we spend sitting each day, we can improve our health outcomes regardless of how much exercise we do,"" said Dr. Healy. She added that sedentary behavior, such as sitting for extended periods of time, has been linked to numerous health issues including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and certain types of cancer. The study also found that participants who reduced their sitting time were generally more active throughout the day, suggesting that making small lifestyle changes, such as taking regular breaks from sitting, can have a significant impact on overall health. Dr. Healy noted that while exercise is still important for building strength and endurance, incorporating movement into daily activities, such as standing while on the phone or taking the stairs instead of the elevator, can also be beneficial. The World Health Organization recommends adults engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week, as well as reducing sedentary time. However, the study’s findings suggest that reducing sitting time may be a more attainable goal for individuals who struggle to meet exercise recommendations. ""With modern work environments and technology making it easier to sit for prolonged periods, implementing strategies to reduce sitting time should be a public health priority,"" said Dr. Healy. Overall, the study’s findings suggest that sitting less and moving more throughout the day may have greater health benefits than solely focusing on increasing exercise levels. By making small lifestyle changes, individuals can improve their health outcomes, even if they struggle to meet exercise recommendations.","Prolonged sitting has been associated with adverse health effects that are only minimally neutralized by exercise, and a new study says aiming for less time spent sitting is the best way to stay healthy. In the study, thought to be the first to explore strategies to conquer what has become a serious public health concern, the research team worked with data from 38 previous intervention trials. Sixty percent, or 23, of the trials appeared promising in relation to the remaining 39 percent, or 15. More promising ideas included providing workers with sit-stand desks, encouraging people to keep track of how much time they spend sitting, setting personal goals for reducing sitting time and setting reminders to remind us to take a break. All of these methods had proven themselves to be successful on their own and, what's more, none of them involve reminding people to exercise. Other effective methods included informing people of the health benefits that could arise from spending less time sitting. ""The importance of this study is not in showing that interventions can work, but in pointing out how they might work,"" says co-author Professor Stuart Biddle of Victoria University in Australia. ""This is crucial if behavior is to be achieved more efficiently and effectively."" After wrapping up their research, the team recommends looking at sitting time as something independent of the need to exercise more. While they hope public health workers and policy makers will pick up on their findings, they advise individuals to start thinking this way now. ""...the findings should also be of interest to anyone looking to improve their health by reducing their own sitting time in their day-to-day lives, as many of these interventions can be adopted on an individual level,"" says co-author Dr. Benjamin Gardner of King's College London. Published in the journal Health Psychology Review, the study supports another from earlier this year suggesting that regardless of regular exercise, prolonged sedentary periods still pose major health threats. ""Avoiding sedentary time and getting regular exercise are both important for improving your health and survival,"" said Dr. Alter, Senior Scientist, Toronto Rehab, University Health Network (UHN), and Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. ""It is not good enough to exercise for 30 minutes a day and be sedentary for 23 and half hours."" While the meta-analysis concluded that those with high exercise quotients experience fewer of the consequences of sitting, exercise should not be viewed as a way to cancel out these negative effects."
193,"Cincinnati Bengals' wide receiver A.J. Green has been named the AFC's Offensive Player of the Week after his outstanding performance in Week 7. In a game against the Baltimore Ravens, Green recorded 8 receptions for 96 yards and a touchdown, leading the Bengals to a 27-17 victory. This is the sixth time in his career that Green has received the Offensive Player of the Week award, tying him for the most in Bengals history with quarterback Boomer Esiason. Green's touchdown catch came in the second quarter, when he made an acrobatic one-handed grab in the end zone. The catch, which has been widely praised as one of the best of the season, gave the Bengals a 14-0 lead and set the tone for the rest of the game. After the game, Green credited his success to his teammates and coaches, saying ""It's a team effort. I can't do it without those guys out there blocking for me and making plays."" Green's performance on Sunday was a reminder of how dangerous he can be when healthy. Last season, he missed seven games due to injury and was limited when he did play. However, this season, he has bounced back with 33 receptions for 494 yards and 5 touchdowns, putting him on pace for one of the best seasons of his career. The Bengals will need Green to continue his stellar play if they hope to make a playoff push this season. With Sunday's win, they improved to 5-2 and are currently in sole possession of first place in the AFC North.","at 12:30p ET Bengals WR A.J. Green , who caught 10 passes for 227 yards and two touchdowns this past Sunday at Baltimore, today was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week by the NFL. Green's 227 yards constitute not only the most receiving yards in a game by any NFL player this season, but also the most yards from scrimmage. The 227 was his career high and the second-most receiving yards in Bengals history, behind Chad Johnson's 260 vs. San Diego in 2006. Green now holds the Nos. 2-3 game receiving yards totals in Bengals history. His previous high, 224 yards last season vs. Pittsburgh, stands third. Green's touchdowns last week were both in the fourth quarter. The first, an 80-yarder on which he ran the last 50 yards and eluded two tacklers, erased a 17-14 Bengals deficit. The second, a seven-yarder, erased another deficit and provided the game-winning points in 28-24 decision. Though he has been a Pro Bowl selection in each of his four full NFL seasons, Green had not previously won an Offensive Player of the Week award. He did win AFC Offensive Player of the Month award for September 2012. The last Bengal to win an AFC Player of the Week award was CB Dre Kirkpatrick , for a two-INT performance in Cincinnati's playoff-clinching win vs. Denver in Week 16 of last season. The last Bengal to win an AFC Offensive Player of the Week award was HB Jeremy Hill , who had 169 scrimmage yards and two rushing TDs in Week 15 of last season at Cleveland.

195,"Iloilo City, Philippines – Senatorial candidate Francis Tolentino has recently raised concerns regarding the majority formula of Senate President Vicente Sotto III's party, the Partido ng Demokratikong Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban) specifically on the inclusion of Rizalito David. David, who is affiliated with the Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) Partylist, was included as a member of PDP-Laban's majority despite his apparent leanings towards leftist ideals. Tolentino, who is also a member of PDP-Laban, expressed in a statement that the basis for David's inclusion in the majority has not been explained clearly. He stated, ""As PDP-Laban member, I would like to know the basis of inclusion of Rizalito L. David in the majority. Is it founded on his loyalty to the party, to the administration, or his legislative track record, or what? What is the primary basis?"" Tolentino further emphasized the need for transparency in the selection process, especially since the PDP-Laban is the largest party bloc in the 18th Congress. He questioned the possible consequences of having a member affiliated with the ACT Partylist, which has been previously linked to the communist movement. David, in a statement from the ACT Partylist, asserted that he has never been a member of the Communist Party of the Philippines nor the New People's Army. He added that he was only affiliated with the leftist group since he was a teacher, but has since resigned from the organization when he entered politics. The controversy surrounding David's inclusion in the PDP-Laban's majority has also led to concerns regarding the party's plans and agenda for the upcoming Senate session. The PDP-Laban, which has been in power since 2016, has been criticized for its loyalty to President Rodrigo Duterte's administration and its apparent disregard for human rights issues. Despite the criticisms, the party has remained steadfast in its support for the Duterte administration's policies, including its controversial war against drugs. As the 18th Congress begins to take shape, the inclusion of David in the PDP-Laban's majority has raised questions about the party's priorities and the direction it intends to take. Tolentino's questioning of David's inclusion and the lack of transparency in the selection process highlights not only the need for accountability within the party but also the importance of ensuring that the Senate serves the interest of the Filipino people.","BY MERIANNE GRACE EREÑETA ILOILO City – Vice Mayor Jose Espinosa III does not know how to count? He should not have included himself among the councilors eligible to vote for the proposed ordinance granting a franchise to an applicant seeking to operate a cockpit, said Councilor Lyndon Acap. Of the 12 councilors present during the Sangguniang Panlungsod’s (SP) session on Tuesday, seven voted in favor of Rockwell and Lumber that plans to operate a cockpit in Barangay Esteban, Lapuz district. According to Acap, seven was the majority vote or more than half of 12. The chairman of the committee on games, amusements and professional sports said he will seek a “reconsideration.” “I went to Ma’am Ruth (Arroyo) – the SP secretary – kon may insakto nga pamaagi (on what is the proper procedure to do so),” said Acap whose committee endorsed Rockwell and Lumber’s franchise application. On Tuesday, Espinosa said the majority count was eight. He raised the number of those eligible to vote to 13 (12 councilors plus himself as presiding officer). He arrived at eight as majority number using the formula of “half plus one” then rounding it off. Nobody voted against granting Rockwell and Lumber a franchise. The five other councilors present merely opted to abstain. They were councilors Armand Parcon, Jason Gonzales, Ed Peñaredondo, R Leone Gerochi, and Lex Tupas. The seven councilors who voted in favor of Rockwell and Lumber were Acap, Rodel Fullon Agado, Joshua Alim, Jay Treñas, Reyland Hervias, Lady Julie Grace Baronda, and Liezel Zulueta-Salazar. “Nakakuha kami seven votes, which is more than half of 12,” said Acap. Espinosa could not be reached for comment as of this writing. Councilor Alim also had the same position as Acap’s. He said right after the voting on Tuesday that the SP presiding officer can only vote if there’s a tie in the voting. There was none on Tuesday. Last week, the SP granted Iloilo Sportsmen, Inc. a franchise to operate the Iloilo Coliseum as a cockpit arena. The coliseum is located in Barangay San Isidro, Jaro district and is the frequent venue of big-time cock derbies in Iloilo City, notably the Candelaria derby every district fiesta of Jaro. Acap believes that more cockpits can deliver huge financial revenues to Iloilo City. Two months ago he introduced a measure allowing the operation of cockpits in the city’s six districts – excluding the City Proper – but it failed to gather support from fellow councilors./ PN"
196,"Former President Barack Obama has praised John Boehner, the former Republican Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, for his service to the country despite their political differences. Speaking at an event hosted by the University of Illinois, Obama said Boehner had worked tirelessly to serve the public and had done so without sacrificing his principles. “I disagreed with John Boehner on a whole host of issues, but he served as Speaker of the House with dignity and commitment,” Obama said. “He pushed back against some of the more extreme elements of his party, and he remained true to his beliefs even when others would have folded.” During his time as Speaker, Boehner earned a reputation as a conservative lawmaker unwilling to compromise with Democrats. He was known for his opposition to President Obama’s policies, most notably the Affordable Care Act, and his often fraught relationship with the White House. Despite their differences, however, Obama said he respected Boehner and appreciated his willingness to work across party lines when necessary. “We often forget that politics is not an all-or-nothing game,” Obama said. “There are times when we have to put aside our differences and work together for the greater good. John Boehner understood that, and I commend him for it.” Boehner resigned as Speaker in 2015 after facing mounting pressure from conservative factions within his party. Since leaving office, he has taken a more critical stance towards President Donald Trump and the current state of the Republican Party. Obama, for his part, has remained vocal about his opposition to the Trump administration’s policies, but has also urged Democrats to remain focused on the “big picture” rather than getting bogged down in partisan bickering. “John Boehner and I may have disagreed on a lot of issues, but we both understood that we were there to serve the American people,” Obama said. “I hope we can find more leaders like him who are willing to put country before party and work together to build a better future for all Americans.”","President Barack Obama weighed in on House Speaker John Boehner's (R-Ohio) resignation Friday, praising him as a ""good man"" and urging his successor to avoid a government shutdown.

Obama continued: ""We obviously have had a lot of disagreements, and politically we're at different ends of the spectrum, but I will tell you he has always conducted himself with courtesy and civility with me. He has kept his word when he has made a commmitment. He is somebody who has been gracious, and I think maybe most importantly is somebody who understands that in governance, you don't get 100 percent of what you want, but you have to work with people who you disagree with, sometime strongly, in order to do the people's business."" Obama said he would not ""prejudge"" the next House speaker and what his relationship might be like with him or her, but warned Boehner's future replacement against shutting down the government. ""My hope is there's a recognition on the part of the next speaker, something I think John understood though at times it was challenging to bring his caucus along, that we can have significant differences on issues but that doesn't mean you shut down the government, that doesn't mean you risk the full faith and…"

198,"Varian, a leading cancer treatment technology company, has announced that it will be putting its research tools in the cloud to speed up the development of next-generation cancer treatment technologies. This move is expected to revolutionize the field of cancer treatment and provide a much-needed boost in the fight against cancer. With the advent of cloud computing, Varian has recognized the opportunity to streamline its research and development process to make it more efficient and quicker. By moving its research tools to the cloud, the company can bring together resources from different locations and make them more accessible to its researchers, which will help to accelerate the pace of innovation in cancer treatment. ""We believe that cloud computing has the potential to transform the way we do research and development,"" said Chris Toth, president of Varian Oncology Systems. ""With access to powerful computing resources, our researchers will be able to analyze large amounts of data more quickly, collaborate more effectively, and develop new treatment technologies faster than ever before."" Varian also sees a significant opportunity to improve patient outcomes through cloud-based research and development. By bringing together large datasets from clinical trials, the company believes it can identify patterns and trends that may not be visible through traditional methods of analysis. This, in turn, could lead to the development of more precise and personalized cancer treatments that target specific genetic mutations. The move to the cloud is part of Varian's broader strategy to accelerate cancer treatment innovation. The company has already made significant investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to enhance its cancer care offerings. With this latest move, Varian hopes to leverage the speed and flexibility of cloud computing to further advance its research and development efforts. However, the move to the cloud is not without its challenges. One of the biggest concerns is data security, especially given the sensitive nature of healthcare data. Varian says it has taken all necessary precautions to ensure the security and privacy of patient data in the cloud. The company has implemented strict security protocols and data encryption measures to safeguard against unauthorized access or data breaches. In summary, Varian's decision to put its research tools in the cloud is a significant leap forward for the field of cancer treatment. By leveraging the power of cloud computing, the company hopes to accelerate innovation, improve patient outcomes, and develop more precise and personalized cancer treatments. It will be exciting to see what new breakthroughs emerge as a result of this move to the cloud.","_ PALO ALTO, Calif. Varian's new Developer Cloud houses digital tools like information about TrueBeam® Developer Mode, and cloud-based applications for managing Developer Mode and simulating treatments. It is part of the company's overall objective to empower research-oriented clinical teams to accelerate the development of new treatment techniques and processes designed to improve outcomes for cancer patients. ""When Varian introduced the TrueBeam platform in 2010, we included Developer Mode, an optional non-clinical development tool for researchers to use in pioneering and prototyping new treatment techniques,"" said Corey Zankowski In a separate development, the OncoPeer online forum, first launched last March in select geographic areas, is now accessible to Varian customers worldwide.

200,"Selfies have become more dangerous than sharks, according to a recent study conducted by the Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care. The study revealed that there have been 259 selfie-related deaths reported worldwide between October 2011 and November 2017, whereas only 50 shark-related deaths were reported in the same period. The dangers of taking selfies have been on the rise in recent years, with people taking life-threatening risks to capture the perfect shot. From standing on the edge of a cliff to posing with wild animals, the urge for social media fame has led to tragic consequences. The study found that the most common cause of selfie-related deaths was drowning, followed by accidents caused by falls and transport-related incidents. The majority of victims were young adults between the ages of 18 and 30, with males being more likely to die while taking selfies than females. The rise of selfie-related deaths has prompted authorities to take action. In Russia, authorities have created a safe selfie guide, which includes warnings against taking selfies with weapons, while driving, or while standing on the edge of a cliff. Several organizations have also launched campaigns to raise awareness about the dangers of taking selfies. The Mumbai police, for example, created a series of posters warning against taking selfies in dangerous areas such as railway tracks and the beach. It is important for people to remember that taking selfies should never come at the cost of their safety. Social media fame is not worth risking one's life over. It is crucial for individuals to exercise caution and use common sense when taking selfies to avoid becoming a part of the growing statistics of selfie-related deaths. In conclusion, taking selfies has become more dangerous than swimming with sharks. While sharks may pose a threat, it is important to remember that a posed picture is not worth risking one's life for. As the saying goes, ""safety first.""","In other words, selfies are killing more people than sharks. While it’s been documented that eight people lost their lives this year due to sharks, ScienceAlert is reporting that more people worldwide — at least 12 — have passed away this year due to a selfie-related incident. In other words, selfies are killing more people than sharks. The latest death by selfie victim was a 66-year-old Japanese tourist who slipped down the steps at Taj Mahal’s Royal Gate in India. Other selfie fatalities include the picture taker falling off a cliff, crashing their car, being run over by a train, or accidentally shooting themselves. So what exactly is going on here? “Part of what happens when a person gets focused and self-absorbed in something — whether it’s their personal problems, a crisis at work or even taking a selfie — they become so immersed to the point where they get distracted and ignore almost everything else that’s around them,” says Stacy Kaiser, licensed psychotherapist. “And in the case of selfies, people are dying because they’re not seeing that cliff or noticing the car that is about to hit them.” In some situations, Kaiser believes that taking selfies, in its simplest form, can be viewed as fun and trendy. “But on a deeper level, there’s a narcissistic element,” she states. “It’s a way of saying, ‘Look at me! Look how great I look! Look where I am! Everyone needs to see it and know about it!’ It’s attention seeking behavior. There has actually been re about the more narcissistic you are, the more selfies you take.” As for the selfie craze, Kaiser doesn’t see it fading any time in the near future. “It’s spreading and becoming even more part of what is considered socially acceptable.” Just be careful out there.

201,"Residents of Dayton, Ohio are showing their support for police officers with a new trend. Along streets in residential neighborhoods, homeowners are painting a ""thin blue line"" between the double yellow lines that divide the roads. This display began to gain traction on social media in recent weeks and has since spread across the Dayton area. The thin blue line is a symbol often used to represent law enforcement, and it is now being used to show support for police in the wake of protests and scrutiny over police brutality and systemic racism. Many residents who have painted the line see it as a way to show appreciation for the often difficult and dangerous work that police officers do. In a year that has been marked by a pandemic and social unrest, some residents have said that seeing the blue line on their streets provides a sense of comfort and support. However, not everyone is on board with the trend. Some activists and community members argue that the blue line is a divisive symbol that ignores important conversations about police reform and accountability. They see the line as a way to support police at the expense of Black and brown communities who have experienced violence and discrimination at the hands of law enforcement. Nevertheless, the trend has found a foothold in Dayton and continues to be a point of conversation among residents. Whether it is seen as a symbol of support or a symbol of divisiveness, the painted thin blue line is yet another sign of the deeply rooted emotions surrounding policing in our country.","About 150 families in a in this city are showing their support for local law enforcement with a painted “thin blue line” — placed on the street curb in front of their homes. Justin Weis, a former Marine Corps police officer, is making it his mission to paint the symbol all over the city. “I want to let officers know that, while they’re in my neck of the woods, I’ve got their backs. Should they be injured in a fire fight or if someone tries to attack them, they’ve got a safe haven in my home,” Weis told News Center 7’s Lauren Clark on Thursday. He took to Facebook a week ago, offering to paint the symbol for anyone who expresses an interest in displaying it. The requests, he says, just keep coming. “I’ve received them from Troy, Tipp City, Vandalia — all the way down to Springboro and Moraine as well,” Weis said. “Of course, I’m really busy here in Huber Heights at the moment but I could see moving this on to other cities and municipalities. Weis is not asking for money. But some people, like Ann Dew, are making donations just to keep the project going. “We’re a house or a family unit that will support our law enforcement — it’s basically just that,” Dew said. “With everything else going on, you know, we just need to start showing our support.” Leftover donations will be given to the Huber Heights Police Department to use as it wishes."

Sponsored by: As part of its data center technology roadmap, eBay planned to upgrade to 40GbE to its servers. In order to meet the requirements of the new design, it needed a cabling solution that would support extremely long multimode fiber runs — up to 500 meters in length — and allow migration to future bandwidth speeds of 100GbE and 400GbE. The company tested the Leviton OM4+ Premium Violet Data Center fiber system with extended reach 40GBASE-XSR4 transceivers. While these transceivers have a manufacturer's stated maximum distance of 400 meters, the channel tested successfully beyond that length, with zero errors or dropped packets when transmitting over 500 meters. The testing subsequently led eBay to install the OM4+ system in four of its data centers. The system uses all OM4+ cabling and connectivity, including Leviton Opt-X Unity trunks, harnesses, array cords, and cassettes.

204,"In his latest address, Pope Francis has praised the private ""mission houses"" in Cuba, which are run by laypeople and provide much-needed services to the community. During his recent visit to Cuba, the Pope met with several of these mission houses and praised their work, saying that they offer a ""creative and generous response"" to the challenges facing the country. These houses are run by laypeople who provide a range of services, including healthcare, education, and food distribution. The mission houses are not affiliated with the Catholic Church, but they do operate in accordance with the Church's social teachings. The Pope's praise for these private mission houses comes at a time when the Cuban government is seeking to limit the role of private enterprise in the country's economy. The government has recently implemented new regulations that make it more difficult for Cubans to start and operate private businesses. However, the mission houses remain an important part of Cuba's social fabric. They are often the only source of critical services in communities that are otherwise underserved by the government. The Pope's visit to Cuba was also notable for the historic meeting between him and Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill. The two church leaders met in Havana and signed a joint declaration calling for an end to the persecution of Christians in the Middle East. During his visit, Pope Francis also urged the Cuban government to continue its process of reform and openness. He encouraged the government to provide greater freedom and economic opportunities for the Cuban people. The Pope's visit to Cuba was seen as an important step towards normalizing relations between the Church and the Cuban government. The Church has played an important role in Cuban society for many years, but it has often been at odds with the government. However, the Pope's visit was marked by a spirit of reconciliation and mutual respect. He met with President Raul Castro, as well as with leaders of Cuba's Catholic Church. Overall, the Pope's visit to Cuba was seen as a positive step towards greater openness and cooperation between the Church and the Cuban government. His praise for the private mission houses is a reminder of the important role that ordinary people can play in building a better society.","HOLGUIN, Cuba — The latest developments in Pope Francis' visit to Cuba and the United States. All times local: 10:10 a.m. Pope Francis is calling on Cubans to heed Jesus Christ's invitation to overcome resistance to change. Speaking in his homily at a large outdoor Mass in Holguin's Revolution Plaza, the pontiff says Christ challenges us daily to believe in the possibility of personal transformation. Francis says ""He invites us slowly to overcome our preconceptions and our reluctance to think that others, much less ourselves, can change."" It's the pope's third day on the island. He has called on Cubans to serve people rather than ideologies and not close themselves off to others who think differently. ___ 10:30 a.m. Holguin's Plaza of the Revolution is packed with thousands of people waving flags as Francis travels in his popemobile through the crowd. It's heating up quickly at 84 degrees Fahrenheit and high humidity, and lots of people are dressed in white to protect themselves from the sun. Cuban President Raul Castro is one of many wearing wide-brimmed straw hats. Security agents don't appear to be letting members of the crowd get close to Francis. On Sunday in Havana, an apparent dissident clung to the popemobile and appeared to be appealing to the pontiff before the man was dragged away. Ismabel Rodriguez is a 20-year-old engineering student who says the pope is urging islanders to embrace values like charity, community and family. Rodriguez says ""Cubans are very nice people, but we've lost a lot of our values. There's lying, robbery and there's isn't enough priority given to the family."" ___ 9:35 a.m. Singing children and a small crowd waving Cuban and Vatican flags are greeting Francis upon his arrival at the airport in the eastern city of Holguin. Some cried out ""Francis! Holguin is with you!"" from the tarmac as the pope emerged from an Alitalia plane. Cuban First Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel is heading the government delegation to receive the pontiff. From the airport Francis travels to the city's Revolution Plaza for a morning Mass in front of thousands of people with hats and parasols shielding themselves from the sun. A giant image of the Virgin of Charity of Cobre, Cuba's patron, is mounted on a building in the square. ___ 9:15 Pope Francis has landed in the eastern city of Holguin, the second stop on a tour of the island ahead of a visit to the United States. The pope is scheduled to celebrate Mass in the city's Revolution and visit La Loma de la Cruz, a cross and lookout point above Cuba's fourth-largest city. Then he'll head to Santiago for a visit to the shrine of Cuba's patron saint in the nearly town of Cobre. ___ 8:05 a.m. A plane carrying Pope Francis has left Havana for the eastern city of Holguin, the fourth-largest on the island, where thousands of people have already gathered in the city's plaza for today's papal Mass. Fifty-eight-year-old Idael Confesor Martinez Leyva wore a straw hat topped with Cuban and Vatican flags as she entered the plaza. She said the pope ""is going to transform the world and bring us what we need most, especially the young people."" In the evening, he heads to Cuba's second city, Santiago."
205,"Political scientist Séverine Autesserre has devoted her academic career to understanding peacebuilding efforts from the ground up. Her work in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) highlights the vital role that local communities play in these efforts. In this edition of “5 Questions,” Autesserre shares her insights on the challenges and opportunities of peacebuilding in the DRC, and how her research might inform policy interventions. 1. Can you give us an overview of your work in the DRC and its relevance to peacebuilding efforts? My work in the DRC centers on understanding the localized dynamics of peacebuilding efforts. Too often, peacebuilding is thought of as a top-down, state-driven process. But my research shows that local communities play a central role in shaping peace and security in their areas. In the DRC, I’ve studied how non-state actors such as local chiefs, civil society organizations, and religious leaders negotiate and construct peace within their communities. By understanding these dynamics, policymakers can design interventions that complement, rather than undermine, local peacebuilding efforts. 2. What are some of the biggest challenges you’ve encountered in your research on peacebuilding in the DRC? One of the main challenges has been accessing local perspectives. The DRC is a vast, complex country with many different actors and communities. It can be difficult to navigate the multitude of power structures and interests that exist at the local level. Additionally, the security situation in many areas of the country has made it difficult to conduct fieldwork. I’ve had to rely on the support of local partners and organizations to gain access and build trust with the communities I’m studying. 3. How might your research inform policy interventions in the DRC and elsewhere? My research suggests that policymakers need to shift their focus away from simply supporting state-led peace processes and toward better understanding local dynamics. This means engaging with a range of actors beyond just state officials, and recognizing the important role that non-state actors play in shaping peace and security. Additionally, my work emphasizes the need to build long-term relationships with local communities in order to design more effective interventions. Building trust and understanding the local context is crucial to the success of any peacebuilding effort. 4. What role do you see for universities and academic research in promoting peacebuilding efforts? Universities have a crucial role to play in promoting peacebuilding efforts. Academics can bring a rigorous, evidence-based approach to understanding conflict and its root causes. Moreover, universities can provide a space for interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers, policymakers, and practitioners. At Columbia, for example, we have a number of initiatives focused on peacebuilding and conflict resolution, such as the Center for International Conflict Resolution and the Advanced Consortium on Cooperation, Conflict, and Complexity. By bringing together scholars from different fields and perspectives, we can generate new ideas and approaches to addressing some of the world’s most pressing challenges. 5. Looking forward, what do you see as the most promising avenues for advancing peacebuilding in the DRC and other conflict-affected countries? One of the most promising avenues is to continue to promote localized, community-led peacebuilding efforts. We need to recognize the agency of local actors in shaping their own futures, rather than imposing external solutions from above. Additionally, there is a need for continued investment in education and capacity building at the local level. By providing training and resources to local actors, we can help them become more effective advocates for peace and security in their communities. Finally, there needs to be a recognition that peacebuilding is a long-term process. Sustainable peace requires sustained efforts over many years, and we need to be patient and persistent in our approach.","The 20-year conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo has killed an estimated 5.4 million people since the 1990s — making it the deadliest since World War II — and armed attacks by different groups occur every week. Séverine Autesserre (SIPA‘00), a member of Columbia's Arnold A. Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies and a political science professor at Barnard College , is an authority on international intervention, conflict resolution, and Central Africa who has researched Congo and visited the nation often since 2001. Q What is the scope of the conflict? The international and national wars started in 1996, but there was already extensive local violence in the eastern part of the country from 1993 on. Millions of Congolese have died and the country has remained one of the poorest in the world. Since its outbreak, the conflict has destabilized most of Central Africa, including Congo’s immediate neighbors Rwanda, Burundi, and Uganda. Q Have there been any peacebuilding efforts? Congo hosts the largest United Nations peacekeeping mission in the world, which attempts to protect the Congolese population from various armed groups and maintain, or enforce, a ceasefire. There are numerous donors, international organizations (such as the African Union), and non-governmental agencies working in Congo, as well as plenty of diplomats. All of these people organize international and national peace conferences, and they try to help the Congolese state reform and train its army, modernize its bureaucracy, and organize free and fair elections. Q Why haven’t those efforts worked? Violence in Congo is in large part driven by local conflicts that international peace efforts have not properly helped address. And by local, I really mean at the level of the individual, the family, the clan, the municipality, the community, the district, and sometimes the ethnic group. For instance, there is a lot of competition over who can be chief of a village or a territory under traditional law, who can control the distribution of land and the exploitation of local mining sites. This often results in localized fighting, and can escalate across a whole province and even at times into neighboring countries. International peacebuilders view local conflicts as “simply” the result of national and international tensions, insufficient state authority, and what they view as the Congolese people's “inherent penchant” for violence. So they consider intervention at the national and international levels as their only option. As a result, there is very little international support for local conflict resolution efforts in Congo. Q Is there an effective way to resolve conflict and build lasting peace? Because many conflicts have such local stakes, national and international peace initiatives need to be supplemented with micro-level efforts. You cannot enact national legislation or impose international law adjudicating who can be the appropriate chief of each local village, or who among five parties in a conflict has legitimate ownership of a piece of land. You need to look at these disputes on a case-by-base basis and find the specific solution for each one. Q Are there signs that give you hope for peace there? Congolese elites and ordinary citizens have been engaged in bottom-up peace efforts since the violence started more than 20 years ago, but they often lack the resources required to be effective. Support from international donors can be crucial, and can lead to the implementation of successful local peacebuilding initiatives. For instance, in the provinces of the Kivus in eastern Congo, the Life and Peace Institute and its Congolese partners have set up inter-community forums to discuss the specifics of local land conflicts, and these forums have found solutions to help manage the violence. In the past few years, an increasing number of donors, international agencies, and non- governmental organizations have starting paying more attention to resolving land conflicts and promoting inter-community reconciliation – two issues that are absolutely key for bottom-up peace. So there is hope that this will lead to concrete action in support of Congolese local peacebuilders. This is the focus of my new research project, which examines how international organizations can do a better job at supporting local actors and initiatives in peacebuilding processes, particularly in Congo."
206,"A family in Georgia got quite a surprise last week when a bundle of marijuana fell from the sky and smashed into their carport. The package, weighing around 22 pounds, landed with such force that it left a dent in the roof, narrowly missing a parked car. According to the Twiggs County Sheriff's Office, the family initially thought the loud crash was caused by lightning. It was only when they went outside to investigate that they found the bundle of drugs. Sheriff Darren Mitchum said in a statement that it's not uncommon for drug dealers to try to use planes to transport their illicit goods across state lines. ""There are many ways that drug traffickers attempt to move their product,"" he said. ""This was just one of them."" The Sheriff's Office has turned the drugs over to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for further investigation. The agency believes that the marijuana may have been dropped by a small aircraft flying overhead. Special Agent Matt Wisniewski of the DEA's Atlanta field division said in a statement that the incident highlights the lengths that criminals will go to in order to evade law enforcement. ""This seizure illustrates the importance of cooperation among law enforcement at all levels in our battle against drug trafficking organizations,"" he said. Meanwhile, the family whose carport was damaged is still trying to process the bizarre incident. ""It's not every day that a package of drugs falls from the sky and lands in your yard,"" said one family member, who wished to remain anonymous. The incident has also raised concerns among local residents about the safety implications of drug trafficking by air. ""What if someone had been standing underneath when that package fell?"" said one neighbor. ""It could have been a disaster."" Despite the concerns, this is not the first time that drugs have fallen from the sky in Georgia. In 2013, a Cessna aircraft carrying over 200 pounds of marijuana crashed in a residential area in metro Atlanta. The pilot was killed in the crash, and several people on the ground were injured. As for the family whose carport was damaged, they are just grateful that no one was hurt. ""We're lucky that it was just a bundle of drugs that fell from the sky,"" said the family member. ""It could have been much worse.""","Maya Donnelly awoke to what sounded like thunder in the early morning hours, but dismissed it as a typical monsoon storm and went back to sleep. Later that morning, she looked in the carport at her home in Nogales, near the U.S.-Mexico border, and saw pieces of wood on the ground. She found a bulky bundle wrapped in black plastic. Inside was roughly 26 pounds of marijuana — a package that authorities say was worth $10,000 and likely was dropped there accidentally by a drug smuggler's aircraft. ""It's all right on top of our dog's house,"" Donnelly said of the Sept. 8 incident, which was first reported by the Nogales International newspaper. ""It just made a perfectly round hole through our carport."" Living near the border, Donnelly said she assumed the object was drugs. She immediately called her husband, Bill, who told her to call 911. The couple said officers who responded told them an ultralight aircraft smuggling marijuana from Mexico had probably let part of its load go early by accident before dropping the rest farther north, the newspaper reported. Nogales Police Chief Derek Arnson said it's the first time in his three-year tenure that he's ever seen a load of drugs hit a building. ""Someone definitely made a mistake, and who knows what the outcome of that mistake might be for them,"" Arnson said. Police are trying to determine whether the bundle was transported by an aircraft or a pilotless drone. Such runs usually occur at night. Maya Donnelly said she thinks it's unlikely someone will come looking for the drugs, which are now in police custody. Arnson agreed but said police have boosted patrols in the Donnellys neighborhood for now. The family will have to pay the estimated $500 in repairs, as well as pay for a new home for their German Shepherd, Hulk. But the scenario could have been much worse for the couple and their three teenage daughters. ""Where it landed was clear on the other side of the house from the bedrooms,"" Maya Donnelly said. ""We were lucky in that sense."" Friends and family also have gotten a laugh. Several joked that the couple could have profited from the surprise package. ""That's what everybody says: 'Why did you call 911?'"" Maya Donnelly said. ""But how can you have a clear conscience, right? We could have made lots of home repairs with that."" ___ Follow Terry Tang on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ttangAP"

208,"As the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi approaches, it is important to remember the impact the celebrations can have on the local community. In light of the ongoing drought situation in many parts of India, the Times of India is urging Ganpati mandals to not only adhere to noise deadlines but also contribute towards drought relief efforts. The Maharashtra government has imposed strict noise pollution guidelines for Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations, with loudspeakers allowed only between 6 am to 10 pm. However, many mandals flout these rules, leading to disturbances for residents and wildlife alike. This year, it is imperative that mandals follow these guidelines to ensure the well-being of those around them. But the need of the hour is not just to abide by the noise deadline but also to extend a hand to those who are struggling due to the drought situation. Many parts of the country are facing severe water scarcity, which has impacted agriculture and livestock. In such times, every contribution counts and Ganpati mandals can play a critical role in providing aid to those in need. The Times of India appeals to Ganpati mandals to donate towards drought relief efforts, in addition to celebrating the festival with joy and fervour. Donations to NGOs working towards drought relief can go a long way in improving the lives of many in affected areas. Whether it is through the provision of water storage tanks or support for sustainable agriculture, every contribution can make a significant impact. Moreover, the spirit of Ganesh Chaturthi celebrates the concept of community bonding and social responsibility. Coming together to support those who are facing adversity is an integral part of this celebration. As such, it is fitting for Ganpati mandals to embody these values and contribute to the well-being of those around them. In conclusion, as we celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi this year, it is important to remember the impact our celebrations can have on those around us. It is not only critical to follow noise pollution guidelines but also imperative to contribute towards drought relief efforts. By doing so, we can ensure that the festival is celebrated in the true spirit of community and social responsibility.","The convener of the Brihanmumbai Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Samanvaya Samiti, on Tuesday, cautioned Ganpati mandals against playing music aloud past prescribed deadlines as ""NGOs would be ready on the streets with their decibel meters."" Naresh Dahibavkar was speaking to a packed auditorium of suburban Ganpati pandal organisers at an event held by the north Mumbai police on Tuesday. ""These NGOs will not even spare the police if the latter do not lodge complaints of noise pollution. The concerned police officer would then have to lose an increment or a promotion,"" Dahibavkar said, adding that he had requested the chief minister to relax noise rules till midnight for at least six days of the festival. The event was organised by the Mumbai Police to reward those Ganpati mandals that had adhered to all security precautions and followed all rules during the festival in 2014. Additional commissioner Fatehsinh Patil said that instructions given out to sarvajanik pandals shouldn't be looked at as an obstacle. ""40000 Mumbai Police will be out on the streets but we cannot protect the city unless Ganpati mandal organisers and karyakartas act as our eyes and ears,"" said Patil. The police have asked mandal organisers to ensure separate queues for male and female visitors at the pandals, install high-resolution cameras and form a team of karyakartas who would ensure there is no sexual harassment of women. ""Low tide is the perfect period for Ganpati immersion. But we have observed over the years that Ganpati mandals with large idols often set out for immersion during high tide. As a result, the idols are not immersed properly. There has to be a deadline set for immersion for large idols,"" said BJP MLA Manisha Chaudhary. Congress MLA Aslam Shaikh said there needs to be a size specification for idols depending on the strength of the mandals. ""There have been instances when smaller mandals get large idols and are unable to ferry them in time to the sea. They then desert the idol midway and leave,"" said Shaikh, adding that eco-friendly idols are the need of the hour. Shaikh, Chaudhary and Dahibavkar appealed to sarvajanik Ganpati organisers to loosen their pursestrings for the drought affected and donate generously to the government."
209,"Wiltshire residents are expressing their concerns with cancer test delays, as overstretching of medical services threaten people's health. The UK National Health Service (NHS) has been experiencing a backlog in the provision of cancer screening services, which is fueling the mounting concerns. Reports indicate that patients are facing agonizing waits for procedures such as CT scans and mammograms, which are vital in the early detection of cancer. This is due to numerous factors such as budget constraints, understaffing, and the effects of the COVID-19 lockdowns on hospitals' operations. According to statistics from the NHS cancer screening program, routine cancer screenings plummeted by over 75% during the pandemic's peak. Moreover, a survey by Macmillan Cancer Support revealed that over 4 in 10 people in the UK had their cancer appointments postponed or cancelled since the onset of the pandemic. The delays are causing panic among some Wiltshire residents, with some fearing their health is being put at risk. One resident, Jane Smith, expresses her concern, saying: ""I have been having some concerning symptoms, and I fear that I may have cancer. However, due to the delays in cancer screening, I have had to wait several weeks for a diagnosis. The wait has been excruciating, and it is affecting my mental health."" Another resident, John Doe, echoes Jane's fears, saying: ""Cancer screening is not something that can wait. Every day counts, and I fear that the delay in my appointment could be the difference between life and death."" Local health authorities have acknowledged the delays and stated that an action plan is underway to reduce the backlog. Measures such as recruiting more staff, increasing the number of screening sites, and extending screening hours have been put in place. The authorities have also urged people to keep appointments to avoid further delays. ""We understand the urgency of cancer screening and we are doing everything in our power to reduce the waiting times. However, we urge people to keep their appointments to avoid further delays and maximize the resources available,"" says Dr. Jane Smith, a senior medical officer at the Wiltshire NHS Trust. The delays come amid a wider debate over the UK healthcare system's capacity and its ability to provide timely and quality care to patients. The backlog in cancer screening is a warning sign of the NHS's overstretching, and it highlights the need for an urgent review of the healthcare system's capacity and funding. As the UK continues to navigate the pandemic's impact on its healthcare system, Wiltshire residents and patients all over the country desire a swift resolution to the issue of cancer screening delays. It is a matter of life and death, and time is of the essence.","Patients are experiencing unacceptable delays for cancer tests due to underfunded and overstretched services, according to two reports. Key waiting times targets are being missed, leading to anxiety for people waiting to hear if they have the disease, Cancer Research UK said. It points to growing pressure on services for imaging and endoscopy - a long, flexible tube that relays images of inside the body on to a TV screen. A report produced for the charity by the University of Birmingham predicts that more than 750,000 extra endoscopies will be needed every year in the UK by 2020. This is a 44% increase on current levels, and is fuelled by the growing number of people who will suffer a range of diseases, including cancer, as they age. A second study for the charity points to major concerns regarding NHS imaging, including an under-resourced workforce and outdated equipment. It said it will cost £215 million to replace old imaging equipment. Imaging services include CT scans, MRI and ultrasound and are key for diagnosing cancer and monitoring progression of the disease. Cancer Research UK argues there are too few staff working in testing, including a lack of nurse endoscopists and radiologists. Sara Hiom, director of early diagnosis at the charity, said: ""Waiting for tests and test results can be a worrying and uncertain time, and delays will only increase that anxiety. ""Patients need to feel reassured that suspected cancer is being taken seriously and is prioritised by the NHS because we know early diagnosis and swift treatment are crucial in giving them the best possible chance of beating the disease."" She said the state of NHS diagnostic services was ""deeply concerning"" and new guidelines for GPs aimed at increasing diagnosis means more people will be waiting for tests. Promoted stories ""There aren't enough trained staff, they're often reliant on outdated equipment and in many cases they're already operating services seven days a week,"" she said. ""GPs do not have the access they need and that means patients are waiting too long for tests. This has to change if doctors are to diagnose more people with cancer earlier, when treatment is more effective."" Latest NHS figures show that half of NHS trusts in England fail to meet the target for 85% of cancer patients to start treatment within 62 days of being urgently referred by a GP. Around 6,100 patients in the first quarter of 2015/16 were not seen within 62 days. The NHS is also only just meeting its target for 93% of patients with suspected cancer to be seen by a specialist within two weeks of referral by their GP (93.6% are seen). The Government's cancer strategy, published this summer, said that by 2020, 95% of patients referred for testing by a GP should be definitively diagnosed with cancer, or have cancer ruled out, within four weeks of referral. Share article Dr Giles Maskell, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, said: ""Well-resourced testing services are crucial to the early diagnosis of cancer, which in turn is vital to increase survival from the disease. ""The earlier cancer is diagnosed, the better the chances that it can be cured."""
210,"Research and Markets, an Ireland-based market research firm, has released its latest report on food formulation trends for 2015. The report highlights the growing popularity of ancient grains and sprouted ingredients in the food industry. According to the report, ancient grains, such as quinoa, amaranth, and spelt, are becoming increasingly popular in North America and Europe. These grains were once considered “alternative” or niche ingredients, but are now mainstream due to their perceived health benefits and unique flavors. Sprouted ingredients, which include sprouted grains, nuts, and seeds, are also gaining traction in the food industry. Sprouting is a process in which grains, nuts, or seeds are soaked and allowed to germinate, resulting in a softer texture and increased nutrient content. The report notes that consumers are increasingly interested in natural and minimally processed foods, which has contributed to the rise of ancient grains and sprouted ingredients in food products. These ingredients are believed to be healthier and more sustainable compared to traditional processed grains. The report also highlights the use of ancient grains and sprouted ingredients in a variety of food products, from bread and pasta to snacks and cereal. Companies such as General Mills and Kellogg’s have introduced products with these ingredients, while smaller companies are also getting in on the trend. The growing demand for these ingredients has led to an increase in production, particularly in areas where these grains have been traditionally grown, such as South America and Africa. The report notes that farmers in these regions are benefiting from the increased demand and are exploring new ways to cultivate and process the grains. Overall, the report concludes that the trend towards ancient grains and sprouted ingredients is expected to continue in the coming years. Consumers are looking for healthier and more natural food options, and these ingredients offer both nutritional benefits and unique flavors. In the U-T San Diego market, local bakeries and food manufacturers are already incorporating these ingredients into their products, catering to the demand for healthier and tastier food options. As the trend continues to grow, it’s likely that more companies will follow suit, making these ingredients a staple in the food industry for years to come.","Research and Markets ( http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/zn64ln/food_formulation ) has announced the addition of the ""Food Formulation Trends: Ancient Grains and Sprouted Ingredients"" report to their offering.

212,"Kenya Power, the leading electricity provider in Kenya, has renewed its partnership with Uchumi Stores, one of the country's largest supermarket chains, to allow customers to pay their electricity bills conveniently. The renewed agreement between Kenya Power and Uchumi Stores will enable customers to pay their electricity bills at any of the 22 Uchumi stores located across the country. This partnership is part of Kenya Power's commitment to providing a wide range of channels to its customers for convenient bill payment. According to the Managing Director and CEO of Kenya Power, Bernard Ngugi, the company is always looking for ways to improve its customer experience. He stated that the partnership with Uchumi Stores is a part of the company's efforts to provide more options for customers to pay their bills, particularly during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic where social distancing is encouraged. ""We are committed to providing our customers with convenient and efficient ways to pay their electricity bills. We understand that some customers may have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and our partnership with Uchumi Stores provides an extra option for them to pay their bills without having to leave their homes,"" said Mr. Ngugi. The partnership with Uchumi Stores will complement other channels of bill payment already available to Kenya Power's customers, including mobile money, debit and credit cards, bank transfers, and other digital platforms. ""We are excited to continue our partnership with Kenya Power and contribute to providing their customers with an additional channel of bill payment. At Uchumi Stores, we are committed to offering our customers a seamless shopping experience, and this initiative falls in line with our values,"" said the Uchumi Stores Chief Executive Officer, Mohamed Ahmed. Bill payment convenience is crucial to many customers, who depend on electricity for their day-to-day activities. Therefore, partnerships between utility service providers and retail stores like Uchumi Stores are essential in bridging the gap and providing accessibility. In conclusion, the renewal of the partnership between Kenya Power and Uchumi Stores is a step towards improving customer experience and providing convenience in bill payment. Customers who prefer to pay their electricity bills at Uchumi Stores can visit any of the 22 stores across the country and make their payments conveniently without having to step out of their comfort zones.","Kenya Power has renewed its bill payments service with Uchumi Supermarkets, four months after suspending the partnership over what it claimed were delays in remitting cash paid in by electricity users. The electricity distributor Tuesday said that renewal of the deal came after both parties entered into a payment pact for outstanding and future amounts. The Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed retailer on Monday announced that it had in an ongoing bid to woo back suppliers and its business partners as part of its overall recovery plan. “We had an issue with the former management of Uchumi Supermarkets over failure to submit payments made at its outlets by our customers. We have resumed operations at Uchumi after the new management made an application to us and we are happy to be business partners again,” said the Kenya Power chief executive Ben Chumo in an interview. “We trust the new management and I have no doubt that going forward we will keep supporting Uchumi for the benefit of the country and shareholders,” added Mr Chumo. He declined, however, to disclose how much money Uchumi owes Kenya Power. Under the partnership, the retailer earns a commission for electricity payments made at its outlets. Uchumi currently has 26 branches in Kenya. Kenya Power has been signing on main retailers including mobile service provider firms, among them Safaricom and Airtel to tap into the huge traffic of shoppers who frequent supermarkets, mostly in urban areas. In May Kenya Power said it would be spending Sh500 million to set up a premium customer care lounge at its Nairobi headquarters targeting corporate clients who contribute to the bulk of its revenue. The move is aimed at attracting new members to the new premium club where beneficiaries have access to specialised lines to call in case of a power blackout or emergency. Empty shelves Uchumi Supermarkets’ management is striving to rebrand the retailer and regain credibility from shoppers who were frustrated by empty shelves and poor customer service. The retailer says its shelves are now about 80 per cent stocked and is seeking to win back more suppliers who had severed links due to non-payment for deliveries. The retailer has already hired a new team among them Julius Kipng’etich as its new chief executive and Willy Kimani as the chief operations officer. Uchumi has also started renovating its hypermarkets in Nairobi, with the exercise expected to end in November. It also plans to close down non-performing branches once the evaluation of all its branches across the region is complete."

214,"Duck and Pineapple Fried Rice: A fusion of flavors unlike any other If you're looking for a dish that combines unique and flavorful ingredients, look no further than Duck and Pineapple Fried Rice. This dish combines the richness of duck with the sweetness of pineapple and the bold flavors of soy sauce and sesame oil. It's a truly transcendent experience for the taste buds. To start, let's talk about the star of the dish: the duck. Duck is a fantastic meat that is often overlooked in American cuisine, but it is a staple in many other parts of the world. It is rich in flavor and tender in texture, making it the perfect meat to pair with bold ingredients like pineapple and soy sauce. When making Duck and Pineapple Fried Rice, be sure to choose a high-quality duck that has been properly handled and prepared. Next, let's talk about the pineapple. Pineapple is a tropical fruit that is widely loved for its sweetness and juiciness. It provides a refreshing contrast to the richness of the duck and also adds a slightly sour note that helps to cut through the richness of the dish. When selecting a pineapple for this recipe, make sure it is ripe but not overly so, as this can cause the fruit to become too soft and mushy. Now, let's talk about the fried rice itself. Fried rice is a classic Asian dish that is typically made by stir-frying rice with a variety of ingredients. In this case, the rice is stir-fried with the duck and pineapple, along with vegetables like carrots, onions, and peas. To give the dish that extra kick of umami flavor, soy sauce and sesame oil are added to the mix. Preparing Duck and Pineapple Fried Rice is a simple process that can be done in less than half an hour. Simply cook the rice and set it aside while you prepare the other ingredients. Next, heat some oil in a wok or large skillet and add the duck, pineapple, and vegetables. Stir-fry until everything is cooked through and fragrant, then add the rice and soy sauce. Stir everything together until well combined, then drizzle with sesame oil and serve. In conclusion, if you're looking for a dish that combines unique and delicious flavors, Duck and Pineapple Fried Rice is definitely worth a try. It's an exotic twist on a classic dish that is sure to please even the most discerning palates. So why not give it a go? Your taste buds will thank you.","Geier’s Sausage Kitchen has wonderful plump Maple Leaf Duck breasts in the freezer. I keep some on hand to make a luscious duck fried rice for family and friends.

According to Coleen, Jake has cut himself off from the family following his breakup with Little Mix singer, Jesy Nelson. The two had gotten engaged in 2015, but their relationship came to an end the following year. Coleen, however, remains optimistic, stating that she hopes Jake will eventually come around and that they can all be a family again. In the meantime, she is looking forward to becoming a grandma and hopes that her relationship with Jake will improve. Coleen Nolan, who became a household name in the UK as a member of the Irish girl band, The Nolans, has since gone on to have a successful career as a television presenter, musician, and author. Her announcement of becoming a grandmother has been met with excitement from her fans, who are eagerly anticipating the birth of her grandchild.","Gosh well doesn't this make us feel old... Coleen Nolan's eldest son, Shane, 26, is expecting his first child - meaning that Coleen is going to become a granny! The Loose Women panellist announced the news on the show on 7 September 2015, saying that her son Shane Ritchie Jr, who was born during her first marriage to Eastenders actor Shane Ritchie, is to become a dad. She said, '[The child] is from my eldest child Shane and Emma, unfortunately they are not together anymore.' She also revealed that the expectant parents have already chosen a name! 'She's going to be called Amelia Rose,' she added. And when asked what the presenter would like to be called, Granny or Nanny, she replied, 'Nanny, I think!' 'I spent most of [my holiday] in America buying this child clothes and my husband said, 'It's not even here yet!' I went, 'Wait until it is!'

217,"In a shocking turn of events, Athletics Australia has announced that it will be cutting funding to Australian Olympic race walker, Brendon Breen. Breen, who was a medal hopeful for the upcoming Tokyo Games, will no longer receive financial support from the organization to help him prepare for the event. The news was delivered in a statement released by Athletics Australia, in which the organization cited Breen’s recent performance record as the main reason for the funding cut. According to the statement, Breen’s results in recent international competitions have not met the expectations set forth by Athletics Australia, leading the organization to reevaluate its financial support of the athlete. The decision is sure to come as a blow to Breen, who has been training relentlessly for the Tokyo Games. The 27-year-old athlete had been receiving funding from Athletics Australia as part of its Olympic Athlete Support Program, which provides financial assistance to Australian athletes who have the potential to compete at the Olympic level. In response to the announcement, Breen expressed his disappointment, but vowed to continue his pursuit of Olympic glory. “It’s obviously a setback, but I’m not going to let it stop me from achieving my goals,” Breen said. “I will continue to work hard and train relentlessly, and I am confident that I will be able to perform at my best come the Olympics.” Despite the funding cut, Breen will still be able to compete in the Tokyo Games, thanks in part to his own personal sponsorship deals. However, the cut will undoubtedly make it more difficult for him to compete against other top-level athletes who have received significant financial support from their respective organizations. The decision to cut Breen’s funding is not without controversy, with many people expressing their support for the athlete on social media. Some have criticized Athletics Australia’s decision, arguing that Breen’s performance record does not accurately reflect his potential, and that cutting his funding will only serve to hinder his ability to succeed in the Olympics. Regardless of the public outcry, Athletics Australia has made its decision, and it remains to be seen how it will affect Breen’s performance in the Tokyo Games. For now, the athlete will continue to train and prepare for the event, hoping to defy the odds and bring home a medal for Australia.","Canberra sprinter Melissa Breen has paid the price for a poor world championships by having her funding cut from Athletics Australia. Australia's fastest woman in history over 100 metres, the 25-year-old was left off the National Athlete Support Structure membership program on Monday. Breen was a late addition to the program last year after she broke Melinda Gainsford-Taylor's 20-year-old national record in the women's 100m with a time of 11.11 seconds. But Breen has struggled to carry that form to the world stage and has missed out on the semi-finals four times in a row. The final straw was when she finished second-last in her heat at this year's world championships with a disappointing time of 11.61 seconds. Athletics Australia high performance director Simon Nathan said it was the selection committee's decision that Breen was unlikely to achieve the program's goals of reaching the top eight at a world championships or Olympic Games. ""She's done everything she can do and been professional and done all the right things, but the outcomes and the actual results at the championships are such that we can't see her making that top eight in the future,"" Nathan said. ""That's why we took her off the program and it lets us support someone else. ""There isn't anybody who tries harder on the team or is more dedicated to training, but what she is unable to do is get that out at the big championships. ""It's a competitive group and she's struggling to get out of the first round."" Breen will still receive partial funding after being included in the Gold Coast GOLD Relay Program designed to support relay squads ahead of the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast. She also has a scholarship with ACTAS. Breen's training partner Lauren Wells, middle-distance runner Zoe Buckman and javelin thrower Kelsey-Lee Roberts have been included in the Podium Potential category. It is the second-tier of funding that includes 42 of the 72 athletes who are in the NASS program. Breen has admitted she made a mistake in training in Canberra ahead of the world championships instead of competing overseas. Nathan said her preparation didn't factor into the funding decision. ""She tried something different and whether she would do it again, I don't know,"" Nathan said. ""Unless you try, you don't know. ""It's the championship results and the outcomes in that environment that we are making our assessments on."""

219,"The real estate market is notorious for offering luxury homes that are seemingly out of this world, with features and amenities beyond what most people can imagine or afford. From the Volcano House in California to the Palazzo di Amore in Beverly Hills and the Flintstone House in Hillsborough, these over-the-top homes often come with jaw-dropping price tags. But what's the real worth of these properties, and who is buying them? Let's start with the Volcano House, located in Newberry Springs, California. Built in the early 1960s, it sits on a 60-acre property that includes a volcano-shaped structure with a one-bedroom, two-bathroom house built inside it. The volcanic cone was created by pouring concrete over a set of giant inflated balloons, providing a unique living space that may appeal to the most adventurous homebuyers. The Volcano House has been on and off the market for years, with asking prices ranging from $650,000 to $750,000. While it's hard to determine the actual value of such a peculiar property, the lack of comparable homes in the area and the limited number of interested buyers make it challenging to set an accurate price. In the end, the real value of the Volcano House is in the eye of the beholder, with some willing to pay a premium price for its one-of-a-kind features while others may pass it up entirely. Moving to the Palazzo di Amore, the stunning Beverly Hills mansion that boasts 12 bedrooms, 23 bathrooms, a 15,000-bottle wine cellar, a Turkish-style spa, a private cinema, and a tennis court. The 25-acre property also includes a vineyard producing around 400 cases of wine each year, as well as a four-acre organic farm. The Palazzo was built in 2002 by real estate developer Jeff Greene, who spent over a decade and $147 million to create this opulent estate. After being on the market for several years, the Palazzo di Amore finally sold in 2020 for $94 million, a hefty discount from its original asking price of $195 million. The high price tag reflects not only the impressive list of features but also the prestige of owning a home in one of the most affluent areas in the world. Buyers who can afford such a property value exclusivity, luxury, and status symbols, and the Palazzo di Amore ticks all those boxes. Finally, we have the Flintstone House, a prehistoric-inspired home located in Hillsborough, California. Built in 1976, it features three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a handful of unique design elements, such as giant dinosaur sculptures and a giant clamshell used as a bathtub. The Flintstone House has become an iconic landmark in the Bay Area, attracting attention from both architectural enthusiasts and a younger generation who grew up watching The Flintstones cartoon. The Flintstone House was last sold in 2017, with a final price of $2.8 million after a significant price reduction from its original asking price of $4.2 million. The unique features of the home may appeal to some, but the overall value of the property is largely tied to its status as a quirky California landmark. However, that hasn't stopped interested buyers from submitting offers, with rumors swirling that a new owner has plans to turn the Flintstone House into a vacation rental. In conclusion, the real worth of an over-the-top home is often intertwined with factors beyond the physical features and amenities. Prestige, exclusivity, status symbols, and even nostalgia can drive up the demand and price of a luxury property, making it challenging to set a precise value. For some, owning a Volcano House or a Flintstone House may be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to stand out from the crowd and fulfill a lifelong dream, while for others, a Palazzo di Amore may be a way to assert their financial power and access an elite lifestyle. Regardless of the motivations behind these purchases, one thing is certain: the real estate market will continue to offer over-the-top homes for those who are willing to pay the price.","When Brian Grey had to figure out the value of a landmark home known as the Flintstone House, the appraiser couldn’t look to comparable residences.

With its clump of bubble-shaped rooms, the home seemed to spring out of a Hanna-Barbera cartoon. Grey quickly realized, “I just don’t have another house that’s like this. ” That didn’t make the property a white elephant, though. When Grey asked several real estate agents in the Bay Area whether there was a market for the unusual home, he recalled, “The consensus was there’s constant demand. ” Sure enough, a buyer snapped it up for $800,000. Nearly two decades later, the quirky marvel – remodeled and enhanced – is on the market again, this time for $4.2 million. It’s one of several out-of-the-ordinary dwellings that have been making headlines lately. In the Mojave Desert, a house shaped like a spaceship and set on the 150-foot cinder cone of an extinct volcano was listed at $650,000 earlier this month and went into escrow Friday. The property, on 60 acres with a lake, got multiple offers. In Beverly Hills, a sprawling compound touted as the priciest home in the U.S. last year just took a $46 million price cut. Despite their differences, houses like these raise a common question: How does anyone – real estate professionals, sellers or buyers – figure out what off-the-wall, over-the-top homes are worth? The Volcano House was owned by TV personality Huell Howser, who gave it to Chapman University in 2012, a year before his death. The university had originally planned to use the house for desert studies, astronomy and geology pursuits. But it’s selling the property because its desert location, in Newberry Springs east of Barstow, was deemed too isolated for students. Brady Sandahl of Hom Sotheby’s International Realty says he and another agent listing the house considered other “architecturally significant” properties, mostly in the high desert, in coming up with the $650,000 price tag. “You just develop a business gut as to what you think the market will capture,” he said. “Then you turn to the buyers, and they’ll tell you why they’re giving you what they’re giving you. That’s the beauty of an open market. ” Sandahl said the multiple offers he received show the asking price was appropriate; three offers came in at $650,000 or more. But clearly, the price tag would be higher if the property wasn’t so remote. “This is real estate,” said Grey, who appraised the Flintstone House. “The first three rules of real estate are location, location, location. ” The Flintstone House is on the opposite side of that rule. It’s 17 miles from San Francisco and right near I-280, a major freeway. “When you’re in the yard of the Flintstone House,” Grey said, “you hear that freeway very clearly. ” While the noise outside the home is a minus, on the plus side, Grey said, the house itself is nearly soundproof: “It’s like being in a cave. ” He attributes that to the construction. Steel rebar and wire mesh frames were built over large inflated weather balloons then covered with gunite, or “shotcrete.” He said that makes the walls thicker than a typical home’s. Appraising even unusual homes involves the basics, Grey said. Size, number of rooms, quality of finishes and condition are all factors considered in addition to location. “Those are relevant to any house, no matter how unusual or historical or plain it is,” he said. THE COMPS With no truly comparable homes, Grey said, he used a bracketing system to determine where the Flintstone House fit on a spectrum. He placed the area’s high-end Tudor homes and plain ranch homes at opposite ends. “Appraising something … it’s quite a bit more art than science,” he said. “In terms of appraising that house, I put it right in the middle. ” He did not make comparisons with unusual homes elsewhere in the country, he said. With land value varying greatly, he explained, “You could be avoiding an adjustment regarding the design of the house and making a huge adjustment for the difference in location. ” In Southern California, Realtors Joyce Rey and Stacy Gottula of Coldwell Banker Previews International cast a considerably wider net to come up with Palazzo di Amore’s $195 million price tag, which has since dropped to $149 million. The agents said they looked to the most expensive homes worldwide. The 25-acre compound with its own vineyard in Beverly Hills was touted as the most expensive in the U.S. when it came on the market last year. The gated, 12-bedroom, 23-bathroom property was eight years in the making. It’s reached by a quarter-mile, tree-lined drive and has a guard station. A two-level entertainment center, with a 50-seat screening room and a bowling alley, is entered through a floating glass-floor walkway over pools lined by 70-year-old olive trees. The main residence tops 35,000 square feet, while the entire estate has more than 53,000 square feet of living space. There’s garage parking for 27 cars, though the site “can easily accommodate parking for (approximately) 150 cars,” according to the listing. “There are so few comps, you really have to look at the history of sales in the area as well as the global sales,” Gottula said. “They’re going to be a global citizen of some kind,” Rey said of the likely buyers. “They’re going to have houses in various places, and they’re going to be looking, in all probability, in all of those markets. ” The Realtors considered the highest sales in London, Hong Kong, France and elsewhere.

220,"The Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) has announced the launch of a new project aimed at improving the protection of migrant workers in Malaysia. The EICC is an organization that works with companies in the electronics industry to promote responsible and ethical practices. Its new project, called the Migrant Worker Protection Initiative, aims to provide better support and protection to migrant workers employed in the Malaysian electronics sector. Malaysia is one of the world's largest producers and exporters of electronic products, and the industry is heavily reliant on migrant workers. However, these workers often face a range of challenges and vulnerabilities, such as low wages, long working hours, and poor living conditions. The Migrant Worker Protection Initiative will involve a range of activities, including outreach and education programs, the development of guidelines and best practices for employers, and the establishment of grievance mechanisms to help workers report abuses and seek redress. The project will also involve collaboration with a range of stakeholders, including government officials, civil society organizations, and worker representatives. In a statement announcing the launch of the project, the EICC's Director of Responsible Business Alliance EMEA, Frédéric Grosse, said: ""The Migrant Worker Protection Initiative is an important step forward in our efforts to promote responsible and ethical practices in the electronics industry. By working together with stakeholders across the sector, we can help ensure that migrant workers in Malaysia are treated with the respect and dignity they deserve."" The EICC hopes that its new project will help to improve the lives and working conditions of migrant workers in Malaysia, and serve as a model for other industries and countries facing similar challenges.","| Business & Human Rights Resource Centre Skip Content Home ▹ Malaysia: Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition launches...

222,"UAW-Ford Vice President, Jimmy Settles, recently issued an update on their ongoing negotiations. As the deadline for a new agreement draws near, there has been some progress in the talks between the United Auto Workers and Ford Motor Company. Settles stated that the negotiations have been going well, with both parties working to find common ground on key issues. ""We're making progress,"" he said. ""We've been making proposals, back and forth, and we're starting to narrow down the issues."" One of the key topics of discussion is the fate of the Ford Michigan Assembly Plant, which is slated to cease production next year. The UAW has been pushing for a new product to be produced at the plant, which could save hundreds of jobs. Settles acknowledged that the issue is a priority for the union, and that negotiations are ongoing to find a solution. Another issue on the table is the use of temporary workers. The UAW has been pushing for limitations on the use of temp workers, arguing that they undermine job security for full-time employees. Ford has been resistant to these proposals, but Settles maintains that the union is committed to safeguarding the position of regular employees. ""We're trying to make sure that we have the right mix of full-time and temporary workers,"" Settles said. ""We want to ensure that people who have been with the company for a long time have job security and that their positions aren't being filled by temporary workers."" Settles also addressed recent rumors about a potential work stoppage, stating that the UAW is committed to avoiding a strike if possible. ""Our goal is to negotiate a fair agreement that benefits our members and the company,"" he said. ""We don't want to disrupt production or harm the interests of our members."" The negotiations between the UAW and Ford come at a time of significant change in the automotive industry, as companies adapt to a rapidly evolving marketplace. Settles emphasized the importance of a strong labor contract in this environment, stating that it was essential to ensuring job security and fair compensation for workers. As negotiations continue, Settles expressed optimism that a deal would be reached. ""Both sides are working hard to come to an agreement,"" he said. ""We're confident that we can find common ground and come to a fair deal that benefits our members and the company.""","MIL OSI – Source: US UAW Union – Press Release/Statement: Headline: Greetings to all UAW-Ford Members: This communication is to provide you – and especially our newer members for whom the bargaining process may be unfamiliar – an update on negotiations and where we are in that process.

This is not unusual and commonly occurs when either another company has been identified as the lead, as is the case here, or when a viable end is in sight and bargaining continues to progress. Numerous subcommittees have been negotiating specific aspects of the contract since July; most have reached tentative agreements. While we continue to meet on outstanding subcommittee issues, larger economic issues remain. Each round of negotiations presents its own unique challenges. We are determined to negotiate the best possible contract for our members while retaining good American jobs. While Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA US) is setting the pattern by negotiating first, we stand ready and able to complete our negotiations. As UAW President Dennis Williams and Vice President Norwood Jewell continue to bargain with FCA US, it is imperative that we, the UAW-Ford members, stand with our brothers and sisters at FCA US in solidarity and support. Our unity is our strength. Many entities against us are attempting to skew perception. I ask that you be cautious of the sources from which you receive your information and the material you choose to share. It is imperative that we are not misguided by rumors or misinformation. Again, unity is our strength. In the midst of negotiating the future of the American autoworker, solidarity is needed now more than ever. We cannot run at the first sign of trouble, nor jump to conclusions at every speculation. We remain in solidarity with you, our retirees and our brothers and sisters at FCA US and General Motors, and encourage you to do the same. We look forward to presenting a tentative agreement for ratification that meets the needs of our entire membership.

223,"New Zealand is set to receive a boost in its shipping and logistics industry with the opening of an inland port in Tauranga's backyard. The new port, located in the city of Rotorua, aims to improve the transport of goods between Tauranga Port and the wider central North Island region. The port is also expected to ease the congestion and pressure on the Tauranga Port, which is currently operating at full capacity. The inland port will be operated by Tauranga Container Logistics Limited (TCL), a subsidiary of the Port of Tauranga. TCL will be responsible for handling the storage, transportation, and distribution of cargoes using its advanced container handling facilities and equipment. According to TCL chief executive Blair Doherty, the inland port will offer a more cost-effective transport solution for local importers and exporters, and will also provide a faster and more efficient option for businesses seeking to transport their goods over long distances. ""We're excited about the new inland port as it will provide our customers with better access to the Port of Tauranga and the wider global supply chain,"" said Doherty. He added that the new port will also help to reduce the environmental impact of transporting goods, as it will enable the use of smaller trucks and reduce the carbon footprint associated with long haul transport. The announcement of the new inland port has been welcomed by local businesses and community leaders, who believe that it will create new economic opportunities and employment in the region. ""We are pleased to see the Port of Tauranga expanding its operations in the central North Island. This development will provide significant benefits to our region, including greater access to global markets and improved infrastructure for our local industries,"" said Rotorua Mayor Steve Chadwick. The inland port is expected to be operational by early 2022, with TCL investing $26 million in the project. The facility will initially have the capacity to handle up to 40,000 containers per year, but this could be expanded in the future to meet growing demand.","Ports of Auckland have revealed their plans for a 1.4 hectare intermodal freight hub including rail connection, container handling facilities and other value-added logistics services. The hub will be constructed only a few kilometres from the Port of Tauranga’s gates. The move is somewhat of a “return of serve” from the former in light of the latter having pioneered the inland port concept in New Zealand when establishing MetroPort Auckland 16 years ago. The development, due to open in Triton Avenue towards the end of this year, will allow for wider competition and choice, said Ports of Auckland chief executive Tony Gibson. “Our Bay of Plenty freight hub will help make New Zealand exporters more competitive on the world stage by making their access to global markets more efficient and easy,” said Mr Gibson. “It also enables us to reduce excessive empty container movements and better balance the volume of exported goods with imported goods through our port. This is good for exporters, for New Zealand’s supply chain logistics and for the port.” New Zealand Shippers’ Council chairperson Mike Knowles views the projeect as “further development in the competitive process”. “Both [ports] are major players in the New Zealand supply chain and both are important to many companies in our membership,” he says. “The ports do compete against each other and against other ports in New Zealand.” ExportNZ executive director Catherine Beard sees the the development positively, stating it will “create good competition and prices for exporters and take cost out of the supply chain”. “We do know that it is a problem in New Zealand that we cart a lot of empties around and that costs money, so if we can do anything to reduce the cartage of fresh air, one would think that is going to translate into greater economies for exporters,” says Ms Beard. The operation, on behalf of Ports of Auckland by Toll Group with land-owner Triton Pacific building the infrastructure required, will complement the port company’s existing inland freight hubs at Wiri (South Auckland) and Longburn (Manawatu).

226,"Minemakers Limited, an Australian mineral exploration and development company, has announced the successful completion of its acquisition of the Baobab Project. The Baobab Project, located in southern Tanzania, is a prospective graphite project that has the potential to be a world-class producer of graphite for the lithium-ion battery market. The acquisition was completed through a share swap arrangement with Edenville Energy, the previous owner of Baobab Project. The deal gives Minemakers 100% ownership of the project and access to its substantial resource base. Minemakers Managing Director, Andrew Drummond, expressed his excitement for the acquisition, stating that ""the Baobab Project is an exceptional asset that aligns with our strategy of building a diversified portfolio of battery minerals projects. We believe the project has the potential to deliver significant value to our shareholders, and we are excited to begin exploring its potential."" The Baobab Project consists of five Prospecting Licences covering an area of 104 square kilometers. Mineralization at the project includes high-grade graphite, as well as other strategic minerals such as cobalt, copper, and nickel. This makes the project highly attractive to the emerging electric vehicle and energy storage markets, which are reliant on these minerals for battery production. Minemakers has wasted no time in commencing exploration activities at the Baobab Project, with a team already stationed on-site. The company plans to undertake an extensive drilling program to better understand the size and quality of the graphite resource and will also undertake metallurgical testing to determine the ability to produce high-quality graphite concentrate. The successful acquisition of the Baobab Project marks a significant milestone for Minemakers and its shareholders. As the demand for battery minerals continues to grow, the Baobab Project has the potential to generate substantial returns for the company and solidify its position as a leading battery minerals producer. Minemakers will continue to update shareholders as exploration activities progress, and investors will be eagerly watching the company's progress as it pursues its vision of becoming a leading producer of minerals for the electric vehicle and energy storage markets.","PERTH, AUSTRALIA -- (Marketwired) -- 09/23/15 -- Minemakers Limited (""Minemakers"") (ASX: MAK)( TSX: MAK ) is pleased to announce the completion of the acquisition of Baobab Mining and Chemicals Corporation SA (""BMCC""), a company which owns the Baobab Phosphate Project in the Republic of Senegal, from Baobab Partners LLC (""Baobab Partners"") (an affiliate of Agrifos Partners LLC).

230,"In today's increasingly polarized political climate, it's not uncommon to hear accusations of ""fake"" news, ""fake"" science, and even ""fake"" people. But what about fake leaders? Are there people out there who claim to lead movements, organizations, and even countries but are nothing more than imposters? The answer, unfortunately, is yes. And the consequences of following fake leaders can be disastrous. One need only look to recent history to see examples of fake leaders who have caused harm and destruction. Take, for instance, the case of Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, a healthcare technology company that promised to revolutionize blood testing. Holmes was hailed as a visionary leader and even graced the covers of major magazines such as Forbes and Fortune. But it eventually came to light that Theranos's technology didn't actually work, and Holmes was charged with several counts of fraud. The company collapsed, leaving investors and patients in its wake. Holmes is just one example of a fake leader who deceived others with her charisma and vision. But what about fake leaders on a larger scale? What about politicians and dictators who claim to lead entire countries? Unfortunately, history is rife with examples of fake leaders who have caused untold suffering. One need only look to North Korea, where Kim Jong-un rules with an iron fist and claims to lead a socialist utopia. In reality, North Korea is a totalitarian state where citizens have little to no freedom or rights. Dissent is punishable by imprisonment or even death. Similarly, the Soviet Union was ruled by a series of fake leaders who claimed to be working for the good of the people but were actually enriching themselves and their cronies. Joseph Stalin, for instance, oversaw the deaths of millions of Soviet citizens during his reign of terror. But what makes a person a fake leader? How can you spot one before it's too late? One key characteristic of fake leaders is a lack of accountability. They may make promises and grandiose claims, but they are rarely held responsible for their failures. In fact, they may even blame others for their shortcomings or claim that they are being unfairly targeted. Another hallmark of fake leaders is a lack of transparency. They may keep secrets from their followers or withhold important information. They may also use propaganda and misinformation to manipulate those around them. Finally, fake leaders often have a cult-like following. They may demand unwavering loyalty and obedience from their followers and punish those who dissent or question their authority. So why do people follow fake leaders? There are many reasons, including a desire for certainty and stability, a need for a sense of identity and purpose, and a fear of the unknown. Additionally, fake leaders may prey on people's vulnerabilities and insecurities, promising them a better future that they know they cannot deliver. But the consequences of following fake leaders can be dire. They can lead to financial ruin, political unrest, and even widespread suffering and death. It's up to each of us to be vigilant and discerning, to ask questions and demand accountability from our leaders. In conclusion, the problem of fake leaders is a serious one that affects us all. While it can be tempting to follow charismatic individuals who promise us the world, we must be careful to distinguish between true leaders and imposters. By remaining vigilant and demanding accountability from those who claim to lead us, we can help prevent the rise of fake leaders and the harm they can cause.","Lying hypocrites beg for votes from the misinformed and unenlightened By John Kaminski http://renegadetribune.com/author/kaminski/ http://therebel.is/kaminski Anyone who runs for president of the United States must supervise the robbery and murder of innocent countries, promise to maintain the unjust slave system of the international bankers, and lie about everything that pertains to the safety of the American people, because there is no safety for anyone in these desperate times as long as Jewish controlled puppets continue to wreak havoc on the entire world. Among the hundreds of delusional demagogues who have run for president over the years, the most pathetic scene I ever witnessed personally was in the 2012 race when a large crowd of white-haired retirees gathered at Sarasota airport to enthusiastically welcome Minnesota Rep. Michelle Bachman, a pro-Israel shill who was later ridiculed for both her use of anti-depressants and her unflinching support for the international bankers who have deliberately sabotaged the American economy for more than a hundred years. They loved her because she told them what they wanted to hear, and what she told them and what they wanted to hear was nothing but a garbled rant about American supremacy and the necessity to pay down the debt before any other money was ever spent. Some of us know now that the debt can never be paid off, which is the essence of the Jewish swindle of the whole world. How could anybody with a brain have ever supported such a facile, drug-addled ignoramus as Bachman, who recently said the only way to avoid war with Iran is to bomb it? But it happens every election, with homicidal crazies urging war on the world to counter false flag threats that have been cynically engineered by the CIA and Mossad. Thanks to a war-mongering media run by the same money men who sell the weapons and commit the colossal crimes, Americans never learn. But just as scary as the bizarre also-rans of history is the list of the people who have actually won presidential elections. Consider in recent years the immoral Bill Clinton, who gave America’s jobs away; George Bush the Younger, who was so dim-witted he had to be left out of the plot to wreck the World Trade Center lest through his stupidity he accidentally revealed the secret Jewish plan; and Barack Obama, who has no verifiable history at all except a suspicious trail of dead homosexual friends and a wife with a male physiognomy. So I guess we shouldn’t be too surprised at the sudden emergence of megalomillionaire Donald Trump as the leader of this year’s pack. He has done what other early leaders have always done, told people exactly what they want to hear. The dark side of this autumn romance, however, is that he is exactly like all the other would-be tyrant candidates — a diehard supporter of Israel, a great believer in a strong military, and a solid supporter of all the financial chicanery that has mired America in its deteriorating economic quagmire. Perhaps Trump’s expertise in the art of bankruptcy will provide a timely skill for the nation’s current and deepening depression. But all of these observations are incidental. The facts on the ground are that none of the current candidates shows any indication of tempering the criminal policies of U.S. aggression against Israel’s enemies, or of addressing the intrinsically unfair policies of the Jewish central bankers who have fleeced America and the world since Woodrow Wilson promised to keep us out of World War I. All the candidates show not a whit of genuine concern for the American people, but only obedience to the Jewish financial powers that make their candidacies possible. Then again, it seems to make a weird kind of sense that the candidates don’t display any verifiable competence and the electorate is predominantly out to lunch. It’s a perfect match. Fake leaders for fake people. From this match made in hell, nothing but further catastrophe can result. ••• Your life is a lie, and the lives of your children are lies, based upon what you have told them about the way the world works, and how their futures will unfold. You based your life on the lies you learned from your parents, received in school, and gleaned from the media and your friends, who have all been immersed in a sea of misinformation throughout their lives. But now the grim fairy tales you have erected to justify your exploitation of the less fortunate of the world are beginning to crumble. The word bounceback has never been more apropos. The law of karma inflicts its deadly reward in the mirrored reflex of savages mimicking the heartless interlopers who have plundered them, desperate savages who now overwhelm the countries that have exploited them in the past. Anything goes, and money is all that matters. And on that day when the money is worth nothing, the world will implode. Anything that can be saved can also be stolen, as today’s Europeans are learning at their peril. Europe and America are about to be overrun by hungry slaves. Nothing can stop them, especially since the government is helping displace its own loyal citizens in a plot too wrenchingly macabre to even begin to comprehend. How does it come to be that many of the refugees subjecting themselves to hardship and fleeing their war-torn homelands have thousands of dollars in their pockets, money which supposedly comes from American sources? How were these refugees able to pay the thousands of dollars for their precarious sea voyages from Turkey to some forlorn Mediterranean shore. Precious few of us are strong enough, at least when we’re young, to discern between the truth and the lie, between the stark unadorned reality that nonplusses us and the fanciful fairy tale that beguiles us. More importantly, the young fail to realize that what we do to others inevitably comes back to haunt us. So we get our news from the newspapers, or today the TV news, which, rather than being purveyors of the actual facts of the world, are rather the curators of the perpetual lies of the world, and in our reading of the news we become like those who have manipulated us always wanted us to become, namely, heartless killers, interested only in our own prospective fortunes. Forced to defend our lives and our property, we will fight. And the Jews will have won, deploying their police to quell the unreasonable unrest. The financial engine of the United States runs on killing people every day, which our candidates conveniently ignore as they prattle on about national security and the need to pay down a national debt that can never be repaid. We have been taught to believe so many false things put forth by our fake media that we can’t hope to even discern what a genuinely altruistic candidate would actually say. We have been so convinced of the necessity of the income tax and the inevitability of inflation that we can no longer grasp the reality that existed in America for more than a hundred years that neither of these parasitic practices existed, and for a century inflation did not occur. We listen to our doctors and the people in control of our children who swear on a stack of Bibles that what they’re doing is best for us, then react in tearful silence as our kids are returned to us at the end of the school day either half dead or totally deformed because of the medicines they were forced to take or the appalling lessons they were compelled to learn (like showing homosexual techniques to first graders to properly prepare them for molestation). The one essential gauge that will indicate America is on the road to realism will be that one landmark day when we finally decided to address the festering lie of the 9/11 coverup. Until that happens we will continue on the road to ruin until America and the human race will run out of time, which will happen when we run out of air, which will happen a lot sooner than everyone thinks. From here on out, no person who refuses to address and overturn the lies that were told on September 11, 2001 can ever be a legitimate president of the United States. All those running now are merely cardboard cutouts furnished by the kosher tyrants who control our lives. They are all guaranteed to do nothing to improve our lives, only to fleece us thoroughly before harvesting our organs. The savage rabble that now overruns the so-called civilized world only delivers the required cosmic payment for the mutilation of their innocence, the rape of their cultures, and theft of their precious possessions. They are here to return the favors. In a country that ignores hapless victims of gratuitous violence lying in the street bleeding, one should not expect a functional response to one’s own misery and pain. That no candidate can realistically promise relief from our misery further indicates that whatever our presidential hopefuls are saying is merely meaningless rhetoric from the insane asylum our society has become. Donald Trump is a specialist in bankruptcy and casinos, which tells us a lot about the future he would guide us toward. Owner of golf courses and beauty contests, his television show featured his ability to fire people in an insulting way. The bottom line is that he has even been fired as boss of his own casinos and the people who invested in those casinos have lost 99 percent of their investments, according to CNN. I think it’s a fair rule of thumb that to vote for Donald Trump — or for that matter any of the announced candidates — that you will lose 99 percent of your investment. Another loser trying to end her unemployment with a stint in the White House is Carly Fiorina, who was fired as president of Hewlett Packard after being labeled as one of the worst technology CEOs of all time. Then there’s Ben Carson, the vaunted neurosurgeon who advocates forced vaccinations despite the poisons in them. I’d mention the other Republican candidates but you could do better picking names at random out of the pages of a big city telephone book. Against this lineup of moribund Republicans, the Democrats counter with Bernie Sanders, an acknowledged Communist, and the old hag Hillary Clinton, who like so many other current American politicians, admittedly most of them Democrats, really ought to be serving life in prison for treason. Every one of these brittle personas have their own quaint fairy tales about what is wrong with the U.S. government, but like the people whose votes they pursue, they all fail to understand the words of the philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti, who once said: It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society. To cast your vote for any one of these announced candidates is to reveal your own blind psychopathology for all to see, assuming there is anybody left who actually can see in this fetid swamp of fake people known as the American populace.

231,"BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, two of the leading global miners, saw their share prices slump on Monday as investors worried about the escalating economic concern caused by China. Shares in BHP sank 4.4%, while Rio Tinto's share price plunged 4.6% in Sydney trading, as investors turned cautious over the country's economic slowdown and the potential impact it would have on demand for commodities. China is the world's largest consumer of commodities ranging from iron ore to copper and aluminium, and its cooling economic growth has sent shock waves across the global economy. The latest slump in commodity prices has put pressure on mining companies like BHP and Rio Tinto, which are already dealing with the rise in operating costs and a slowdown in growth in key markets like Europe and the US. The latest data on China's economy, released over the weekend, showed that industrial profits fell by 1.9% in August, compared with the same period last year, while private sector investment growth slowed to its lowest level in more than 20 years. Investors are now worried that the weakness in China's economy could push commodity prices even lower, hurting revenues at mining companies and denting their profits. However, some analysts believe that the weakness in BHP and Rio Tinto's shares could be an opportunity for long-term investors. ""Whilst there is understandably some caution around what China's deceleration means for the broader materials space and hence for companies like BHP and Rio, we believe BHP remains one of the more attractive resource stocks in the sector,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Paul Hissey. Despite the slump in the share prices of BHP and Rio Tinto, both companies remain confident in their long-term outlook. BHP CEO Andrew Mackenzie said in a statement, ""The long-term fundamentals of our business are strong, and we remain confident in the value that can be created by our diversified portfolio of high-quality, low-cost assets."" Rio Tinto CEO Jean-Sébastien Jacques echoed that sentiment in a separate statement, saying, ""Rio Tinto is well positioned to continue delivering superior returns and sustainable value for shareholders over the longer term."" Overall, while short-term concerns over China's economic slowdown have led to a dip in share prices for both BHP and Rio Tinto, the long-term prospects for these mining giants remain strong, as they continue to focus on improving their operations and capitalizing on new growth opportunities around the world.","Blue chip miners share prices plummeted as soon as the Australian market opened after a horror night for resources stocks on the London exchange, as analysts warn it is particularly vulnerable to China's slowing growth and prices slump. Blue chip miners share prices plummeted as soon as the Australian market opened after a horror night for resources stocks on the London exchange, as analysts warn it is particularly vulnerable to China's slowing growth and prices slump. In early trade, BHP Billiton shares are down 3 per cent to $23.12 and Rio Tinto 2 per cent to $48.24. The losses continue the declining trend this year in line with commodity prices. Rio Tinto has lost 14.9 per cent and BHP 22.7 per cent since January, and 5 per cent this month alone. The decline could see BHP tumble below the year-low of $22.84 reached in August. A fall below this price would see it reach a new seven-year low. Overnight, BHP Billiton lost 5.1 per cent and Rio Tinto fell 3.2 per cent in London. The falls come amid as global markets face the inevitable slowdown of the Chinese economy and its demand for industrial metals. On Tuesday the Asian Development Bank lowered its growth expectations for China. Ratings agency Moody's described the resources sector as the most exposed to China's slowing growth, a call underscored by Credit Suisse, which cut its Chinese forecasts for demand. ""Much of this is a catch-up to current conditions, which remain highly uncertain, but until China demand and emerging market currencies find a floor, it will remain challenging to put an absolute floor on commodity prices,"" Credit Suisse research analyst Liam Fitzpatrick told The Financial Times. In June, RBC Capital revised its ratings for BHP Billiton to underperform but maintained Rio Tinto at ""neutral"" and South32 at ""outperform"". South32 dropped 1.2 per cent on the London exchange over night. At the time, EIM Capital's John Robertson warned BHP's had long been overvalued and that he expected it to continue to fall. ""BHP's value proposition has always been overestimated. It was in almost every fund, individual and institutional, and this demand saved it from the reckoning when the sector repriced, but now its day has come,"" Mr Robertson said. On Wednesday, the company announced an upcoming vote that could see Australian shareholders sacrifice some of the company's franking credits to ensure it can meet its dividend requirements to UK shareholders. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald."
232,"CLEVELAND - The Cleveland Cavaliers and Tristan Thompson were unable to reach a deal before the deadline, leaving the 6-foot-9 forward without a contract. Thompson, who has played for the Cavs since 2011, was seeking a new deal that would pay him $94 million over five years. The Cavs, however, were unwilling to offer more than $80 million over five years. The two sides had been negotiating for weeks, but the deadline passed without a resolution. ""We love Tristan and want him to be a part of our future, but at the end of the day, we have to do what is best for the organization,"" Cavaliers General Manager David Griffin said in a statement. Thompson is coming off a career year in which he averaged 8.5 points, 8.0 rebounds and 1.2 blocks per game. He was also a key contributor in the Cavs' run to the NBA Finals, averaging a double-double in the postseason. The 24-year-old Canadian's play in the NBA Finals was particularly impressive, as he averaged 10.6 points and 12.1 rebounds per game. Thompson's agent, Rich Paul, said that his client would consider other offers from around the league. ""Tristan is an elite player and deserves to be paid as such,"" Paul said in a statement. ""We will explore all of our options and make the best decision for Tristan and his family."" Despite failing to reach a deal with Thompson, the Cavs have had a successful offseason so far. The team re-signed LeBron James, Kevin Love, and Iman Shumpert, while also adding free agents Mo Williams and Richard Jefferson. The Cavs also traded for guard Joe Harris and drafted guard Tyus Jones in the first round of the NBA Draft. Thompson, who was drafted fourth overall by the Cavs in 2011, has career averages of 9.3 points and 8.7 rebounds per game. He has also been a durable player, missing only one game in his four-year career. It remains to be seen where Thompson will play next season, but he is sure to attract interest from other NBA teams with cap space.","The Cleveland Cavaliers and restricted free agent Tristan Thompson are still at an impasse on a new contract with training camp starting this week. Thompson missed the team's media day on Monday. The Cavs did not accept Thompson's most recent offer of a three-year maximum contract that his side proposed last week, according to ESPN.com. Thompson likely will miss the start of practice on Tuesday. ""We love Tristan Thompson and we want him to be part of our future,"" general manager David Griffin said Monday. ""I think everything in our actions and our offer indicate that. ... We're excited about moving forward with him into the future in whatever form that may take. ""There's nothing lost by what Tristan is doing in this process. This is his right to do this. This system works for a reason."" The 6-foot-10 Thompson has until Thursday to accept the Cavs' one-year qualifying offer of $6.9 million to become an unrestricted free agent next year if no deal is reached. The Cavs have made different offers over the summer, going as high as $16 million in an average annual salary, according to ESPN. Thompson wants a three-year, $53 million max contract or a five-year deal for $94 million. The 24-year-old Thompson averaged 8.5 points and 8.0 rebounds during the 2014-15 regular season when he was the Cavs' sixth man. After Kevin Love was injured in the first round of the playoffs, Thompson started at power forward. In the NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors, he averaged 11.6 points and 12.6 rebounds. Cavs star LeBron James was asked about Thompson's situation at the team's media day. ""As the leader of this team, I understand how important Tristan is to this team,"" James said Monday. ""I think we all saw what he's able to do in the postseason, and not only the postseason but all throughout. ... He's a huge piece to the puzzle, to our success. Not having him here today, possibly tomorrow or however long it is, that the organization and Tristan, they'll get something done. We all know how important he is to our success."""
233,"Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Inc. has experienced a decline in their stock after the release of their second-quarter earnings report. With a decrease of over 10%, the shares have fallen to $17.96 per share. Despite an increase in revenue and earnings, the growth was not enough to meet the expectations of analysts. This has caused concern among investors, who are now wondering about the long-term prospects for the company. Analysts are warning that it may take some time for Krispy Kreme to regain investors' confidence.","Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. saw its stock plummet this week after it reported second-quarter financial results that, despite a 5.6 percent increase in revenue, did not meet earnings expectations.

234,"US stocks opened steady in early trade on Wednesday, with the energy sector leading gains. Despite ongoing uncertainty around the global economic conditions, investors seem optimistic about the resilience of the US economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose marginally as the session got underway, although the gains were not widespread. However, energy stocks were among the top performers, buoyed by higher oil prices. Shares in Exxon Mobil Corp rose 0.8%, while Chevron Corp added 0.6%. The S&P 500 energy index was up 0.5% in early trading, making it one of the best performing sectors. Investors are closely watching developments in the oil market, amid ongoing tensions in the Middle East and concerns about supply disruptions. Meanwhile, the weakening dollar is also supporting the price of crude. Despite the gains in the energy sector, however, other areas of the market were struggling. Consumer discretionary shares fell 0.3%, while technology stocks were trading lower. In the consumer sector, shares of Target Corp dropped 3% after the company reported disappointing sales growth for the holiday season. The news raises concerns about the overall health of the retail sector, which has been under pressure from online competition and changing consumer behaviour. Technology stocks also struggled, with shares in Apple falling 0.8%. The tech giant's shares have been under pressure in recent weeks, amid concerns about slowing iPhone sales. Despite the mixed performance across the market, investors appear to be taking a cautious approach, with the VIX volatility index, often referred to as the ""fear index,"" remaining near its recent lows. Analysts say that while the US economy continues to show signs of strength, there are still plenty of reasons for caution. Ongoing trade tensions with China, uncertainty over Brexit, and concerns about a slowdown in global growth all suggest that the market could experience more turbulence in the weeks ahead. However, for now at least, investors seem content to remain cautiously optimistic, with the energy sector leading the way in early trade on Wednesday.","European stock markets recovered their poise Tuesday despite an earlier rout in Asia which featured a 4 percent slide in Japan's main index. KEEPING SCORE: In Europe, Germany's DAX rose 0.2 percent to 9,504 while the CAC-40 in France was steady at 4,357. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares underperformed its main European counterparts, trading 0.5 percent lower at 5,929. U.S. stocks were poised for a solid opening with Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures up 0.5 percent. SOUR COCKTAIL: Over recent days, worries over China have resurfaced, not least in the impact the slowdown in the world's number 2 is having on commodity prices, many of which have fallen to multiyear lows. On Monday, commodities group Glencore saw its share price tank by around a third amid concerns over its ability to service its debts if commodity prices don't rise. The fallout from Volkswagen's emissions rigging scandal also remains with investors unsure of the impact on the industry. Fed officials, meanwhile, continue to signal they will raise U.S. interest rates this year, marking the beginning of the end of ultra-low interest rates that have underpinned stock markets. ANALYST TAKE: ""At the risk of saying 'It's that time of year,' bearing in mind the timing of historical equity market crashes in September or October, there is no doubt that a confluence of events is unsettling investors,"" said Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital. GLENCORE BOUNCE: One of the reasons why the market mood has improved is that Glencore has seen its share price bounce back 6 percent from Monday's hammering. On Tuesday, analysts at Citibank said the fall in Glencore's share price — about 80 percent from its high in May — has been ""overdone"" and suggested the company could raise more money from the sale of investments than the $2 billion it has penciled in. Citibank analysts also said Glencore management could consider taking the company back into private hands. ASIA'S DAY: The calmer backdrop in Europe was not anticipated after the earlier rout in Asia, which followed Monday's big down day on Wall Street. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped 4.1 percent to 16,930.84 while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined 3.8 percent to 4,918.40. Hong Kong's Hang Seng ended down 3.0 percent at 20,556.60 while the Shanghai Composite in mainland China shed 2.0 percent to close at 3,038.14. ENERGY: Benchmark crude rose 47 cents to $44.90 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent Crude, a benchmark for international oils, was up 53 cents to $47.87. CURRENCIES: The euro was down 0.2 percent at $1.1225 while the dollar fell 0.1 percent to 119.83 yen."
235,"Global markets are in a cautious mood ahead of the release of China's trade data, with Asian shares seeing a mixed start on Monday. This comes amid concerns about escalating tensions between the United States and China, which continue to weigh on investor sentiment. The Shanghai Composite opened lower on Monday, down 0.3% in early trading, while Japan's Nikkei 225 edged up 0.1%. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index remained closed for a public holiday. Investors are anxiously waiting for China's trade data, which is expected to show that exports fell in August for the fourth consecutive month, underscoring the impact of the ongoing trade dispute with the U.S. Analysts believe that a weaker-than-expected reading could put further pressure on the Chinese economy, which has already been hit by slowing growth and rising debt levels. The trade war between the world's two largest economies has already led to fluctuations in global markets and has given rise to a sense of uncertainty among investors, particularly as tariffs threaten to disrupt global trade and supply chains. ""Trade uncertainty remains the most significant risk to the outlook,"" noted Nick Maroutsos, co-head of global bonds at Janus Henderson. ""The longer the trade war drags on, the more likely it becomes that businesses make 'non-reversible' decisions, such as shifting production from China to other countries."" In addition to the trade dispute, investors are also keeping a close eye on protests in Hong Kong, which have been ongoing for almost three months now. Recent demonstrations at Hong Kong International Airport led to chaos and flight cancellations last week, further damaging the city's economy and tourism industry. Some analysts believe that the situation in Hong Kong could lead to more widespread unrest in the region. ""The Hong Kong protests may spark further tensions between the U.S. and China,"" noted Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda Asia Pacific. ""This adds another layer of uncertainty to an already volatile market."" Overall, global markets remain on edge as investors weigh the ongoing trade dispute and other geopolitical risks against the backdrop of a slowing global economy. As the trade war drags on and tensions in Hong Kong continue to simmer, market volatility and uncertainty are likely to persist in the near term. In conclusion, investors will be closely watching China's trade data release in order to gain insight into the economy's performance and the impact of the trade war. A weaker-than-expected reading could exacerbate concerns about the global economic outlook and could lead to further market volatility.","* Asian shares edge up tad, eye on China trade data China FX reserves highlight China capital outflows * Emerging currencies with limited FX reserves under pressure By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Asian shares edged higher on Tuesday and U.S. stock futures jumped following the lead of European stocks overnight, but investors were cautious ahead of China data which could give more clues on the health of the world's second-largest economy. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.1 percent in early trade but is still down 0.9 percent so far this week and is not far from a three-year low hit two weeks ago. U.S. stock futures jumped almost 1 percent after a market holiday on Monday, erasing a large part of gains made after Friday's mixed U.S. employment report. Japan's Nikkei rose 0.1 percent, extending its rebound from a seven-month low hit early on Monday. European stocks rose on Monday, lifted by mining and commodities giant Glencore after it pledged to slash its debt by a third. Still, investors will be glued to China trade data at 0200 GMT, which is expected to show a further contraction in both imports and exports in August. Chinese shares fell on Monday after a long weekend with tighter futures trading rules and supportive comments by China's central bank governor failing to stem selling pressure. Also highlighting the sheer size of Beijing's market intervention to halt a slide in the yuan, China's foreign exchange reserves posted their biggest monthly fall on record, $94 billion, in August, data showed on Monday. The drop revived concerns that the government may have to let the currency weaken further after its surprise devaluation in mid-August, adding to pressure on other emerging market currencies. ""The fall was larger than market expectations... Coupled with other data, it shows that the Chinese authorities have been intervening to support the yuan as capital outflow continues,"" said Shin Kadota, chief FX strategist at Barclays in Tokyo. On Monday, Malaysia's ringgit plumbed fresh 17-year lows while the South African rand slipped to a record low, both under pressure because of relatively limited foreign currency reserves. With U.S. financial markets shut for holiday on Monday, the dollar moved little against major currencies. The dollar index stood at 96.206, little changed from late last week. Against the yen, the dollar ticked up slightly to 119.45 yen , still half-way in recovering its losses on Friday. The euro stood little changed at $1.1159. Oil prices fell more than 3 percent on Monday, as the fall in Chinese share prices and record North Sea crude production added to global supply concerns. Brent crude futures rose 0.9 percent to $48.02 after a 3.7 percent fall on Monday. They still traded below the 50 percent retracement of their rally late August to $54.32 from 1/2-year low of $42.23.

239,"OPINION: Saffin set to rise from the ashes Recent events have taken a toll on the global economy, with countless businesses struggling to stay afloat amidst the pandemic. However, despite the turbulent times, one company, Saffin, may be set to rise from the ashes. Saffin, a leading manufacturer of consumer goods, has a history of resilience. The company has weathered numerous market fluctuations and economic downturns in the past, thanks to its innovative product line and strong leadership. But what sets Saffin apart in today's volatile climate is its forward-thinking approach. They have already begun to pivot their business strategy to focus on sustainable practices, and the move couldn't have come at a better time. With a growing number of consumers prioritizing eco-friendly products, Saffin's dedication to sustainability is a savvy business move that could pay off in a big way. Furthermore, Saffin's leadership team understands the importance of empowering their employees and fostering a positive work culture. By investing in their workforce, Saffin is not only building loyalty and increasing employee satisfaction but also positioning itself as an employer-of-choice in today's competitive job market. While the future remains uncertain for many businesses, Saffin's ability to adapt, innovate, and prioritize sustainability and employee wellbeing make it a company to watch. As the world emerges from the pandemic, Saffin may just be the rising phoenix that soars above its competitors.","FORMER PM John Howard once described himself as ""Lazarus with a triple bypass"" for rising from the dead to reclaim the leadership of the Liberal Party. While I wouldn't put Labor's Janelle Saffin in the same category, her political comeback in Page was hardly surprising. She is set to challenge Kevin Hogan of the Nationals, who unceremoniously dumped her from the federal seat at the 2013 election. This is going to be a tight contest one way or another. Both parties will need to spend big bucks on election advertising. That's one area Hogan was streets ahead of Saffin in 2013 as the Nats were able to swing money they were going to spend on Barnaby Joyce's campaign in behind Hogan after Tony Windsor dropped out of the race in a neighbouring electorate. Saffin also suffered from Labor's toxic brand and dissatisfaction over leadership changes. She was one of Kevin Rudd's key supporters. Her job in booting Hogan out of her former seat would have been a whole lot easier a week or so ago when Tony Abbott was in power. Malcolm Turnbull has swung swinging voters in behind the Coalition again and now her path back to Page looks far from certain. Hogan hasn't done a bad job since taking up the reins. He's safe and steady and has ""saved"" a few things from the axe. But Saffin is a really cunning campaigner and she has a strong list of achievements to point to while in office."
240,"If you've been dreaming of a luxurious vacation but the low Australian dollar has left you feeling discouraged, don't worry - there are still plenty of options available. With some careful planning and smart choices, you can still enjoy a luxurious holiday without breaking the bank. The first thing to keep in mind is that luxury doesn't have to mean five-star hotels and Michelin-starred restaurants. While those are certainly nice, there are other ways to experience luxury on a budget. Think about what's important to you - is it serene surroundings, personalized service, or unique experiences? By identifying your priorities, you can focus your budget on the things that matter most to you. One great way to save money while still enjoying luxury is to choose destinations that have a lower cost of living. For example, Southeast Asia offers a wealth of luxurious experiences at a fraction of the cost of Europe or North America. Countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia have a thriving luxury market, with high-end hotels, spas, and restaurants that are much more affordable than their counterparts in the Western world. Another option is to consider traveling in the off-season. Many luxury destinations experience a drop in prices during the shoulder season, which can be a great opportunity to score some deals. For example, Caribbean resorts often offer lower rates during the summer months, when temperatures can be hot but there are fewer crowds. This can be a great way to enjoy a luxury beach vacation without paying peak season prices. If you're looking to save money on your flights, consider using a travel rewards credit card to earn points that can be redeemed for airfare or hotel stays. Many credit cards also offer other perks, like airport lounge access or free checked bags, which can make your travel experience more comfortable and enjoyable. Just be sure to pay off your balance in full each month to avoid interest charges. When it comes to accommodations, there are a few tricks you can use to save money without sacrificing luxury. One is to look for deals on luxury vacation rentals, which can offer more space and amenities than a hotel room for a lower price. Websites like Airbnb and VRBO offer a wide range of rental properties, from chic city apartments to sprawling villas in the countryside. Another option is to book a package deal that includes airfare, accommodations, and activities. Many travel companies offer these types of packages, which can be a great way to save money while still enjoying a luxurious vacation. Just be sure to read the fine print and compare prices carefully to make sure you're getting a good deal. Of course, luxury is also about the experiences you have while you're on vacation. Luckily, there are plenty of free or low-cost activities that can still allow you to feel like you're living the high life. For example, many cities offer free tours or cultural events that can be a great way to experience local culture without spending a lot of money. You can also try renting a bike or going for a hike to explore the natural beauty of your destination. Ultimately, the key to enjoying a luxury vacation on a budget is to be smart and strategic about your choices. By focusing on what's most important to you and looking for deals and discounts, you can still enjoy a fantastic vacation without breaking the bank. Whether you're dreaming of a beach getaway, a city break, or an adventure in the great outdoors, there's a luxurious vacation out there that's within reach - even with a low Australian dollar.","Even with a falling dollar, you don't have to give up on all of travel's 'luxuries'. Photo: iStock Luxury in travel is a matter of how you look at it, writes Lee Tulloch. Australian travellers have become rather fond of the comforts that a strong dollar has bought but the recent currency free fall has had quite a few of us doing our sums and trying to work out how we can continue to travel in the manner to which we have become accustomed. I'm off to the Republic of Ireland, a Eurozone country, but counting my blessings I'm not going to Northern Ireland, a pound country. The daily exchange rate has suddenly become my obsession. With every euro cent we plunge, I'm thinking: goodbye good times. If it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience, or even just the best experience available, go for it, and spend modestly on something else. But of course that is ridiculous. It's possible to have ""champagne wishes and caviar dreams"" (to quote a popular 1980s TV show) when the dollar buys less than 48 pence or US65¢. The first thing that needs to be rebooted is the concept of luxury. I'm always suspicious of the word 'luxury'. Often it's just a description of a bland, mediocre service that has a few frills more than basic. True luxury might be about many other things, according to personal taste - privacy, tranquillity or enriching experiences, perhaps. The dollar value on it is becoming increasingly irrelevant. The word is becoming irrelevant and meaningless too. One man's luxury might be gold taps and a plethora of cushions and obsequious service. Another's might be downtime in a beautiful, remote location where you can go off the grid. Still another might be a resort or cruise where you can leave the children in the hands of others. Or sleeping in a villa with an amazing history. The most ""luxurious"" hotel suite I've ever seen didn't have a whisper of gold or any hint of dazzle – it was exquisitely simple, created by one of the world's most notable designers. Luxury can be what is not as much as what there is. Simplicity can be as costly as ornamentation. Degrees of opulence never determined luxury for me. Often I'm more impressed with the small details, like pure cotton pyjamas provided at a Vietnamese resort, or a bath filled with rose petals in Bali. The greatest luxury for me in travel, what gives me my biggest kicks, is not wallowing in a bed with millions of pillows or sitting up the front of a plane, it is making friends with strangers, spending time with the great characters that populate our world, the thrill of discovering differences but also fellow feeling in the way we all look at the world. Leisure travel is luxury. We are fortunate to be able to do it. Travelling thriftily for me is not about cutting corners but about enhancing the experience and not giving in to false economies. I've learnt over the years by the mistakes of made, such as denying myself the restaurant where I'd really like to dine in favour of a cheaper one, and finding that, in the run of things, that extra $100 hasn't mattered one bit. If you wish it, small luxuries are perfectly possible at any time. Siphon off a day or two for a splurge on a pricey hotel or set aside funds for a lavish night out. Divert to a less expensive city, like Budapest, which is as opulent as Paris or London. You can have a little bit of luxury every day if you play your cards right. Someone once gave me some very good advice – travel with an evening gown or something dressy, because you never know who you might meet and where you'll be invited. So I always travel as if that invitation to someone's palace or villa is just around the corner. And if it isn't, I make my own glamour. Cocktails may cost upwards of 25 euro ($40) in the bars of some of Europe's luxury hotels, but you can nurse one for hours. The bar somewhere classy like Le Meurice in Paris is fascinating, full of diplomats, celebs and eccentrics. Even if you're staying somewhere that's nowhere near as salubrious, no one need know. You'll remember the night you lived it up at a swank hotel. Similarly, if you're dressed for it, the sales assistants of the world's expensive boutiques will let you play with their clothes and shoes for hours and you don't have to buy a thing. If it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience, or even just the best experience available, go for it, and spend modestly on something else. The nickels and dimes don't matter. It's the memories that count."

It's possible that the rule was conceived simply as a reminder not to wear lightweight, easily stained white clothing outside of the summer season, which was book-ended by Memorial Day and Labor Day. It's also thought that in the late 1800s and early 1900s, the white after Labor Day rule was part of a vast and complex set of fashion and etiquette rules meant to separate older land-owning families from the nouveau riche population in the U.S. However, since the 1950s and 60s, when the white after Labor Day custom reached its peak and then began to decline, it's become entirely acceptable to wear white into September and right through the winter.

242,"Former Australian cricketer Steve Smith has revealed that the 2013-14 Ashes series will always be the fondest memory of his former teammate Brad Haddin. Smith, who played alongside Haddin in the Australian team during the legendary Ashes campaign, shared his thoughts on Haddin's remarkable performances in an interview with Yass Tribune. ""He was unbelievable that series. He was always there chipping away, keeping and batting well, and just doing everything right for the team,"" Smith said. Haddin had an outstanding series, scoring 493 runs at an average of 61.62 and claiming 22 dismissals behind the stumps. His performances helped Australia win the series 5-0, with the wicketkeeper-batsman being named Player of the Series. Smith revealed that Haddin's influence extended beyond his performances on the field, saying that he was a great leader and role model to the younger players. ""He was such a positive influence in the dressing room, and his leadership was really important for the team,"" Smith said. ""He was always willing to help the younger guys and pass on his knowledge and experience, which was hugely beneficial for us."" Haddin retired from international cricket in 2015, having played 66 Tests for Australia. He finished with 326 dismissals behind the stumps and scored 3,266 runs with six centuries to his name. During his career, Haddin became known for his fearless approach and his ability to perform under pressure. Smith said that these qualities were evident throughout his time playing alongside the veteran wicketkeeper. ""He was a real competitor, and he always thrived under pressure. Whether he was batting or keeping, he was never intimidated by the situation,"" Smith said. ""He was a great player to have in the team, and his contributions both on and off the field will always be remembered."" Smith himself is a former captain of the Australian cricket team and one of the top batsmen in the world. He has had a prolific career, scoring over 7,000 runs in Test cricket at an average of 62.84. But despite his own success, Smith said that the memories of the 2013-14 Ashes campaign and playing alongside Haddin will always hold a special place in his heart. ""That was a really special time for me personally, but also for everyone in the team. It was just a great group of guys, and Brad was a huge part of that,"" Smith said. ""He was one of the best players I ever played with, and I'm proud to have shared the field with him.""","New Australia captain Steve Smith will look back on the 2013-14 Ashes series as the greatest example of Brad Haddin's positive impact on the Australian team. New Australia captain Steve Smith will look back on the 2013-14 Ashes series as the clearest and greatest example of Brad Haddin's positive impact on the Australian team. When Smith made his first-class debut in early 2008 for NSW their gloveman was Haddin. Later that year he succeeded Adam Gilchrist in the Test team, a role current coach Darren Lehmann said he handled deftly despite the lofty expectations. Smith, 26, said the now-retired Haddin had been a ""great mentor"" for him at state level, and had been even better when he progressed to the national team where Haddin was entrenched as first-choice wicketkeeper. ""In the Australian set-up as well he was always took me under his wing and helped me develop as a player and as a person. I'm very thankful for that,"" Smith said in Manchester on Tuesday evening, after learning of Haddin's announcement. Smith marvelled at Haddin for making 493 runs at an average of 61.63 to, with Mitch Johnson, spearhead Australia's successful bid to regain the Ashes at home in 2013-14. ""The [2013-14] home Ashes, where we won 5-0, he was a massive part of that. I think he scored [at least] 50 in the first innings in all five of those Test matches,"" he said. ""Batting at No.7, I think he really came out and played positively. I think there were a lot of [instances] where he got us back into the game, just from sheer [will] and taking the game on. He was magnificent at that, and I think a lot of keepers around the world can learn from the way he played."" Smith also hailed Haddin as ""certainly one of the best team men I've ever been around ... always put the team first in every aspect"". Coach Lehmann, who first played against Haddin almost 15 years ago when the wicketkeeper was just 22, said Haddin was not only a fantastic player but also ""a fantastic mentor for a lot of young players [and] a great mentor for me as coach"". ""He's a fantastic human being and he'll be welcome in our change rooms all the time, because he's an absolute superstar,"" said Lehmann, who was part of the selection panel that excluded Haddin for the second half of the just-completed Ashes series. ""He made some crucial runs for us in Ashes series, and in different series all round in all formats. For us, his keeping was exceptional, his batting was very good. It was a case of him being able to turn a game very quickly for you. That's what [Adam] Gilchrist did exceptionally well as well."" Lehmann said Haddin would leave a vast and diverse legacy: ""The baggy green, the way he wore it with pride. The way he helped younger players. The way he helped drive the team as a whole. The way he helped coaches. The way he helped mould the team. The way we play today is an exceptional legacy for him. The way he thought about his family and helped his family through difficult times, and the way he helps other people's family and friends,"" he said.

243,"Boxing legend Floyd Mayweather Jr. has announced his decision to retire from the sport, declaring himself as ""the best ever"" in a sport that he dominated for more than two decades. In a recent interview with IBN Khabar, Mayweather expressed that he has nothing left to prove in the ring, adding that it is time for him to ""give back to the sport"" that has made him a household name. The undefeated boxer has amassed an impressive 50-0 record throughout his career, securing various world titles across different weight classes. His last bout was against mixed martial arts (MMA) superstar Conor McGregor in 2017, where he won by technical knockout in the 10th round. Mayweather, who is known for his flashy lifestyle and penchant for luxury cars and jewelry, also revealed that he wants to focus on his various business ventures outside of boxing. ""I've done it all. I've fought the best fighters in the world, and I've beaten them all. I've made more money than any other boxer in the history of the sport. It's time for me to retire and focus on other things,"" Mayweather said. He also addressed the ongoing debate about his legacy as a boxer, saying that he has no doubt in his mind that he is ""the best ever."" ""I've seen all the greats come and go, and I've beaten most of them. I've never lost a fight, and I've done it for longer than anyone else. I am the best boxer of all time,"" he said. Mayweather's retirement has not come as a surprise to many, as the 44-year-old has teased a possible end to his career in recent years. However, his announcement has drawn mixed reactions from fans and critics alike, with some hailing him as a boxing legend while others criticize him for not taking on tougher opponents in his later years. Despite this, Mayweather remains unfazed by the criticisms, saying that he has always done what is best for his career and his legacy. ""I've always done things my way, and it's worked for me. That's why I'm the best ever. I've never ducked anyone in my career, and I've always put on a show for the fans. That's all that matters,"" he said. Mayweather's retirement marks the end of an era in boxing, as one of the sport's greatest champions bows out. While his legacy will continue to be debated for years to come, one thing is for sure – Floyd Mayweather Jr. will always be remembered as one of the greatest boxing champions of all time.","Floyd Mayweather Jr. plans to go out unbeaten and on his own terms, as 'The Best Ever', when he ends his boxing career in Las Vegas next week with his welterweight title defence against fellow American Andre Berto. Should Mayweather win, as is widely expected, he would match the 49-0 record of former heavyweight great Rocky Marciano but says he would not be tempted to come out of retirement for a 50th fight. Image Credit: . ""Forty-nine is my last fight,"" the five-division world champion, aged 38, told reporters on a conference call on Wednesday before saying that self-preservation in the ring had always been a top priority. ""My health is more important. Anything can happen (in boxing). I am not really worried about losing. You can make a lot of money but you still won't be able to talk, walk and have a sharp mind. ""Of course, it's always about self-preservation. I come first but I appreciate the fans. I do. The only thing I can do is believe in myself. I'm going to be TBE (The Best Ever) until the day I die."" Many pundits have doubted Mayweather's claim that he will end his career after the Sept. 12 bout, pointing to the American's U-turn when he came back from a 21-month retirement to fight Mexican Juan Manuel Marquez in September 2009. ""Like I have said and Floyd has said a number of times, this will be his last fight,"" Leonard Ellerbe, CEO of Mayweather Promotions, said on Wednesday's conference call. ""Why can't a man go out when he has had an illustrious career, accomplished everything that he needed to accomplish and be done? And he has done it his way. ""Over the last week, I have received three major movie offers. We fully expect Floyd to be heavily, heavily involved in the entertainment industry because this is what he does right now ... that is going to occupy a lot of his time."" Mayweather, whose 48-0 record includes 26 knockouts, is renowned for his brilliant defence in the ring though he has often been criticized for selecting easy opponents while building his impressive resume. Asked what he regarded as the greatest achievement of his career, he replied: ""Every fight played a major key ... and number 49 is going to be important also. But my career's not over yet."" Berto, a twice former welterweight world champion, will step into the ring as a heavy underdog after losing three of his last six fights but Mayweather is wary of underestimating his opponent. ""When you've got a guy that's put in a situation with nothing to lose, it makes him work that much harder,"" said Mayweather.

There's a skeleton. There's a foldup massage table. And then there's Waring, guiding his clients through an array of movements while discussing the health of their body. But Waring isn't a doctor or a physical therapist. He's a bike fitter, who adjusts bikes by discovering riders' best possible position on the cycle for comfort and speed. It's Waring and this back area that has made Parvilla Cycle & Multisport a premier bike shop on the East Coast. After just four years in operation, the store has been ranked one of the top 50 bike shops in the country by Active Times and was one of six nominated for best pro road shop in the nation by Interbike Awards. ""This is the store,"" said Waring, who started the shop with Iain Banks. ""Fitting is our store and why we are doing as well as we are four years into a brand-new business."" While the store has garnered a strong local presence for its bikes and accessories, riders from around the country flock to the shop to get a fitting. Waring and his colleagues said he is typically booked about four weeks in advance for his fittings. He does one fitting a day Monday through Friday. Each one takes about four hours and costs $350 for the standard package and $500 for the premium. ""1/8Waring's3/8 one of the best fitters on the East Coast, so that brings in a broader range of customers,"" service manager Joseph Sikorski said. Bike fitting wasn't Waring's first job, though. He got his degree in naval architecture and spent about 20 years in the industry, but he later got his fitting education through Retul, which is based in Boulder, Colo. He has since become an instructor for the company and is its only fitter on the East Coast. Waring brings his engineering background to help his understanding of bikes, but he also enjoys studying the body and said he has picked up on things from chiropractors and physical therapists. It's Waring's blend of the two aspects that allows him to best suit his clients. He can tell when customers need to correct their back problems, but rather than do it himself, he recommends them to a specialist and then has them come back once they are healthy. ""There are fitters out there that will make the computer look good,"" Waring said. ""They'll work the numbers and do all kinds of stuff and it looks good on the screen, but they get out there and they are jacked. The problem is it's the hips or the knees. They don't know enough or care enough about the body."" That's where Waring looks to set himself apart. And once he has a healthy client, he is able to turn to his machinery and knowledge to help improve a person's position on a bike. Situated in the back room, Waring has a ""Guru Dynamic Fit Unit,"" which amounts to being a machine bike that is adjustable. Waring said he has used it roughly 2,000 times and credits it for generating about $350,000 a year, thus deeming it his ""printing press."" Surrounded by TV monitors, the machine allows Waring to adjust his client's position on the bike while still riding instead of having to manually change the bike over and over until the correct spot is found. His background and equipment recently helped get an individual with cancer in his neck into a position where he can ride. He was previously having trouble looking up because of his limited mobility, but his position has changed that and he asked Waring whether he could go for a ride to coach him. Waring doesn't coach anymore, but instead, he plans on just enjoying a nice day with him. ""We are just going to go and have a coffee and have a ride some time,"" Waring said. ""I get a kick out of that. That, to me, is what it's all about."" It's that family attitude, beyond just the fitting, that has helped build the store, the employees said. Banks' wife, Sarah, who co-owns the store with Waring, said it comes down to knowing customers' names and chatting with them when they stop by. ""We are able to cater to everyone at the same time, whether it is someone getting into it or someone that wants a $20,000 bike,"" Sikorski said. ""We treat everyone the same. We are small group of people. We are like a family."" The store holds weekly rides that allow it to not only grow a customer base, but also build a community around the store. On Mondays, it offers about a 20-mile co-ed bike ride that leaves from the store. Then Wednesdays, it has a ladies-only ride followed by a barbecue. ""It brings more people to the area,"" Sikorski said. ""It's a friendly atmosphere, just everyone hanging out having a hot dog and a beer."" Banks said he and Waring set out to make the business something different to separate it from other independent bike stores. Waring and his bike fitting has done that for Parvilla. But there is more to the store than just that back room. Bikes line the wall, helmets rest on shelves, and now there's also triathlon equipment. The bike fitting might be the main revenue stream and what draws outsiders in, but Parvilla Cycle & Multisport prides itself on everything else it offers the community, too. ""As much as we still do the high-end, custom, niche items, we are still that neighborhood bike store as well,"" Banks said. ""We will still work on everybody's bike."""
251,"Labour is set to review tax legislation, according to John McDonnell, the party's Shadow Chancellor. McDonnell announced the move during a speech at the Institute of Public Policy Research. The review will examine the current tax system and make recommendations for reform, with a focus on ensuring that the system is fair and transparent. McDonnell said that the current system is not working for the majority of people in the UK, and that radical reform is needed. ""We need a tax system that works for everyone, not just the wealthy few,"" McDonnell said. ""The current system is riddled with loopholes and is overly complex, meaning that many people are not paying their fair share. We need to change that."" The review will also look at the tax avoidance industry, and how it can be tackled. McDonnell said that the industry was ""costing the country billions of pounds every year"" and that it was ""morally indefensible"". ""We need to crack down on tax avoidance and make sure that everyone is paying their fair share,"" McDonnell said. ""It's not right that some companies and individuals can avoid paying tax, while the rest of us are left to pick up the bill."" The review will be carried out by a team of experts, who will work with the Labour Party to develop a set of recommendations. McDonnell said that the team would be ""independent and impartial"", and would have the knowledge and expertise to develop a system that is fit for purpose. ""We need to bring together the best minds in the country to develop a tax system that works for everyone,"" McDonnell said. ""We need to listen to experts and stakeholders, and ensure that the system we develop is fair, transparent and efficient."" The review has been welcomed by many within the Labour Party and beyond. Chris Leslie, the MP for Nottingham East, said that the move was ""long overdue"". ""The current tax system is overly complex and is in desperate need of reform,"" Leslie said. ""It's time for us to take a serious look at how we can make the system fairer and more transparent."" However, the review has also been criticised by some. Andrew Bridgen, the Conservative MP for North West Leicestershire, said that the move was ""yet another example of Labour wanting to tax people more"". ""The last thing we need is more tax hikes,"" Bridgen said. ""Labour's tax policies would only hurt hardworking families across the country, and this review is just another example of their misguided approach to taxation."" Despite the criticism, McDonnell remains committed to the review, and believes that it will lead to a fairer and more transparent tax system for all. ""We need to take a long, hard look at the tax system and make some radical changes,"" McDonnell said. ""I believe that this review will move us in the right direction, and help to create a system that is fit for purpose and works for everyone.""","Labour will perform a full review of tax legislation and the Treasury as part of a bid to clamp down on big business tax avoiders, shadow chancellor John McDonnell announced as he laid out his party's plans for the economy. Mr McDonnell said there would be an ""institutional review"" of a ""whole range"" of organisations to see whether they are fit for purpose, and called for renewed investment in the tax office to close down loopholes that allow large corporations to pay minimal tax. John McDonnell called for the introduction of a new 'national bank' The MP for Hayes and Harlington called for the introduction of a new ""national bank"" to help the UK's long-term investment infrastructure. Mr McDonnell also said he wants a return to separate government departments to manage public expenditure and help drive economic growth. The new shadow chancellor highlighted an annual tax gap of £120 billion, saying that a ""significant proportion"" of that should be collected. He told LBC radio: ""What we need to do now is invest in HMRC, get the tax inspectors to work and start closing down some of these loopholes. ""It is appalling that actually some of the biggest corporations are not just having their corporation tax cut by (Chancellor George) Osborne to the lowest level we have ever seen, at 18%, but in addition to that, even with low levels of taxation, they are not paying their way. I find that appalling."" Mr McDonnell added: ""We have put together a group of economists that will come together as an economic advisory council. ""One of the tasks I am going to be giving them is a review of all tax legislation and a review of the role of HMRC so we can get back to the state doing what it should do, (which) is making sure we collect our taxes."" The chairman and make-up of the new body will be announced within the next fortnight, he said. Mr McDonnell added: ""I am looking to have an institutional review of a whole range of organisations to see whether or not they are fit for purpose at the moment and how they can be improved, and that includes a review of the Treasury itself."" And he called for a reorganisation of government departments to focus on long-term growth. He said: ""I would like to see the current BIS (Department for Business, Innovation and Skills) actually transformed into an economic development department. ""I think what we should be doing is saying to the Treasury, 'do your job', about managing monetary and fiscal policy alongside the Bank of England, which will remain independent but should have a new mandate, but also making sure the Treasury does its job about monitoring properly efficient public expenditure. ""But let's have a department that actually drives economic growth and investment."" Labour is also arguing for the launch of a new state investment bank, Mr McDonnell said, to stabilise long-term investment infrastructure. He said: ""That would be a state bank, a nationalised bank, if you like, exactly the same as they have in Germany and elsewhere. ""What I would like to do as well is build up a state sovereign fund."" Mr McDonnell vowed that Labour would tackle the nation's financial deficit. He said: ""What George Osborne is doing is basically loading the payment on the deficit on middle and low earners and some with no earnings at all, those on welfare benefits. ""It is disgracefully unfair, so what we are saying is, we will tackle the deficit first of all by making sure corporations and the rich pay their taxes, full stop. ""Secondly we will not be making the tax cuts to the corporations that the Government is now planning, and we will make sure as well that we start preparing a long-term investment plan that gives us prosperity. ""If we can get reasonable growth back into the economy we can tackle the deficit, as long as we make sure people are paying their taxes.""

252,"The Australian cricket team's decision to hold back from touring South Africa has left the government puzzled. According to Prime Minister Scott Morrison, the government is uncertain about the rationale behind the decision. The Australian cricket team's withdrawal has left South Africa infuriated and has raised questions about the security arrangements put in place for the tourists. The government is not sure whether the decision was made due to concerns about the COVID-19 situation in the country or security issues. Speaking to reporters about the matter, Morrison stated that the Australian government had not been informed of any security concerns by Cricket Australia. He added that the government would like to receive more clarification from the cricket board about their decision. As the situation in South Africa continues to unfold, the Australian government is closely monitoring developments. They have encouraged Cricket Australia to engage in constructive dialogue with their South African counterparts to address any concerns that the Australian team may have. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the issue, Morrison emphasised that the government is committed to supporting and promoting Australian sport both domestically and internationally.","A A- A+ Govt unsure aboutwhy Aussie team held back: PM NEW YORK, Sept 30 (BSS): Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said her government was still not sure why the Australian cricket team postponed their scheduled tour to Bangladesh. ""We are not sure why the Australian Cricket team is not coming to Bangladesh,"" she told a press conference at Bangladesh UN Permanent Mission here on Tuesday evening. The Prime Minister, however, said both sides were discussing the matter. ""In the past we have witnessed similar situation. Pakistan and India teams played in Bangladesh. Even the World Cup cricket was hosted here. It's absolutely a matter of Australia why they suddenly decided not to visit Bangladesh,"" she said. Sheikh Hasina noted that Bangladesh hosted a number of sports events in the past with foolproof security and no untoward incidents happened. ""Untoward incidents have taken place in many countries, but not in Bangladesh ... our law enforcement agencies and all concerned have enough expertise to ensure security of the players and our people are also very much conscious about this,"" she said."
253,"In a move aimed at improving the country's finances, Greece has successfully raised 1.4 billion euros in a sale of six-month treasury bills. The auction, which took place on Wednesday, saw strong demand from investors, with the yield on the bills dropping to 0.05%, down from 0.09% in the previous auction. This is the second time this year that Greece has turned to treasury bill sales to raise funds. The country faced a prolonged period of economic turmoil following the 2008 financial crisis, which resulted in a number of bailout loans from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. Despite these challenges, Greece has made significant progress in recent years, with the economy expanding by 2.2% in 2019. The country has also managed to reduce its deficit, and its debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall in the coming years. While the latest treasury bill sale is a positive sign for the country's finances, Greece still has a long road ahead as it continues to rebuild its economy and secure its financial future.","Greece raised Wednesday 1.137 billion euros ($1.280 billion) in an auction of six-month treasury bills at the same 2.97 percent interest rate it last sold them at last month, the Greek Public Debt Management Agency said. Since the last auction on August 5, Athens and its international creditors agreed a third huge international bailout for the debt-stricken country, worth 86 billion euros over three years. However there has not been boost in investor confidence as early elections were called for September 20 after Alexis Tsipras resigned as prime minister last month following a serious split within his radical-left party Syriza over the bailout. Wednesday's auction of 875 million euros of 6-month T-bills was over-subscribed by a ratio of 1.3. Athens sold 812.5 million euros of six-month bills last month.

Wood pitched six-and-a-third shutout innings, surrendering just three hits and two walks while striking out three batters. The Padres were unable to mount any significant offensive threat against him. The Dodgers were able to score their only two runs of the game in the fourth inning when outfielder Yasiel Puig hit a two-run home run off Padres starter Clayton Richard. Despite multiple opportunities on both sides, there was no further scoring in the game, giving the Dodgers their 67th win of the season. With the win, the Dodgers remain in first place in the National League West, while the Padres continue to struggle, sitting in fourth place in the same division.

255,"The highly-popular Super Fund faced a serious setback as the contribution halt caused it to miss out on potential gains. The decision to halt contributions was a result of considering a range of market conditions, according to Super Fund CEO Matt Whineray. The contribution halt has put a dent in the Super Fund's plans to hit its goal of having a $70 billion fund by 2025. Whineray acknowledged that the decision has caused a short-term financial impact on the Super Fund but maintains that it was the right decision given the current economic climate. The decision to halt contributions has been criticized by some, who argue that the Super Fund should continue to accept contributions in order to capitalize on the current market conditions. However, Whineray has defended the decision, stating that the Super Fund's focus is on long-term gains and not short-term fluctuations. The contribution halt is not the only challenge that the Super Fund is facing. The COVID-19 pandemic has also had a significant impact on the fund's investments, as global markets have been rocked by the pandemic's economic fallout. Despite this, Whineray remains confident in the fund's long-term prospects. ""We remain confident in the resilience of our long-term investment strategies and believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on market opportunities as they arise,"" Whineray stated. The Super Fund's investment strategies have been credited with its success in the past, as the fund has consistently delivered strong returns for its members. The fund's investment mix includes a diverse range of assets, including shares, property, and infrastructure. Despite the challenges facing the Super Fund, Whineray remains optimistic about its future. He stated that the fund is committed to its long-term goals and that it will continue to prioritize sustainable and responsible investment strategies. ""The Super Fund is committed to delivering strong long-term returns for our members while contributing to a more sustainable future,"" Whineray stated. ""We remain focused on our goal of having a $70 billion fund by 2025 and are confident in our ability to achieve it.""

New Zealand has missed out on adding billions to its retirement savings pot over the past year because the Government is not contributing to the NZ Superannuation Fund. The NZ Super Fund revealed it returned 14.6 per cent after costs and before tax in the year to June 30. It finished the year at $29.5 billion, up $3.1b on the year before. The fund's results show that the Government would have been 11 per cent better off if it had made contributions over the year, instead of using the money to pay down its debts. That outperformance, compared to the cost of debt servicing, was worth $2.9b to the fund in the 2015 year. NZ Super Fund chairman Gavin Walker said the result was an excellent one. ""The past year has continued a pattern of very strong, above-market returns."" Since the Government stopped contributions in 2009, the fund has gone through a period of double-digit returns, averaging 16.8 per cent over the past five years. READ MORE: Government should restart contributions The fund calculated it would now have at least $17.8b more in its coffers if the contributions had continued through that period, and would be closing in on $50b. The Government would have been $6.2b better off over the past five years if it had paid contributions rather than using the money to service debt. But Walker said the double-digit results could not be expected to continue indefinitely. He said the fund was expected on average to earn 8 per cent to 9 per cent a year. Chief executive Adrian Orr acknowledged global markets were experiencing increased volatility and uncertainty. Global equity markets fell 6.49 per cent in August. Orr said the volatility would inevitably have an impact on returns in the short term. ""It is normal to see considerable volatility in our monthly and indeed annual returns.

256,"Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto has expressed his concern regarding the impending closure of Macy's department store in downtown Pittsburgh. He is urging the citizens of Pittsburgh to save items from the old Kaufmann's building, where Macy's has been operating, before the closure of the store. In an effort to preserve the historical significance of the building, Mayor Peduto is asking the people of Pittsburgh to save any mementos or items they may have accumulated during their time shopping at Kaufmann's or Macy's. He hopes to create a collection of these items that can be displayed or used as a tribute to the iconic department store. The Kaufmann's building, which was built in 1887 and served as a shopping destination for more than a century, is a significant part of Pittsburgh's history and architecture. It is also the birthplace of the popular department store chain, Macy's. The store has been an essential part of Downtown Pittsburgh since 2006, offering a wide variety of products and hosting several events. The closure of Macy's downtown location comes as part of the company's plan to cut costs and focus on its more profitable locations. Nearly 100 Macy's employees will lose their jobs, and the closure will be a significant blow to the downtown area, which has suffered during the pandemic. Mayor Peduto is calling on local historians, organizations, and collectors to help preserve the legacy of Kaufmann's and Macy's by donating or lending items to the collection. He said that the collection could help people understand why Kaufmann's and Macy's were essential institutions in Pittsburgh for so long. The Mayor emphasized that the initiative is not just about saving items but also about creating a space for people to share their memories of the department store. He noted that people can submit their memories, stories, and photos to help create a comprehensive and meaningful collection. The deadline for submissions is yet to be determined, and the location of the collection is not yet finalized. However, Mayor Peduto assures that he will keep the public informed as things progress.","Pittsburgh's mayor wants to make sure holiday window relics, an icing bag that was used to make thumbprint cookies, and other artifacts from the downtown Macy's store live on after it closes later this month. Mayor Bill Peduto wrote a letter to the department store chain last week saying he wants all artifacts of historic value to be preserved, maintained and made available for public view, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported . Peduto's chief of staff, Kevin Acklin, said the mayor stepped in after the city was notified that Macy's and its contractor were attempting to sell off some historical items from the landmark building, where the now-defunct Kaufmann's chain ran its flagship store for more than a century. But Macy's spokeswoman Elina Kazan said it was always the chain's intent to preserve the building's artifacts. Macy's has its own archivist sorting through the material and is working to safeguard the items, she said. ""We knew the store housed a lot of history in it and it is an ongoing process,"" Kazan said. ""We respect the legacy of Kaufmann's and what the downtown building signifies. We are exploring every avenue to allow Pittsburghers to still experience and enjoy it."" Among the items the city is trying to preserve are Tic Toc and other Kaufmann's restaurant menus, an exterior brass store plaque, a salon chair and employee name tags. The building was acquired a decade ago by Macy's, which sold it to Core Realty for $15 million because it was only using a third of the space. The Philadelphia developer plans to convert it to apartments, a hotel and retail space. Randy Mineo, Core's executive vice president of leasing, said the firm is interested in setting aside a place in the building to display Kaufmann's and Macy's artifacts."
257,"Northwestern pulled off a stunning upset on the road as they defeated the No. 21 Stanford Cardinal on Saturday evening by a final score of 21-17. The Wildcats' defense was the star of the show as they held the Cardinal's potent offense to just 17 points and 324 total yards. Despite being underdogs heading into the game, Northwestern came out swinging early on. Quarterback Peyton Ramsey led the offense down the field on their opening drive, capping it off with a 9-yard touchdown pass to tight end Charlie Mangieri. The Wildcats' defense held strong on Stanford's first offensive possession, forcing a quick three and out. Both teams traded punts for the remainder of the first quarter and majority of the second quarter until Stanford finally found the end zone on a 5-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Jack West to wide receiver Simi Fehoko. However, Northwestern quickly answered back with a 16-play, 75-yard drive that took up over seven minutes of game time, culminating in a 2-yard touchdown run by running back Evan Hull. The Cardinal added a field goal just before halftime to make the score 14-10 in favor of Northwestern. The third quarter saw both teams struggle to put points on the board, but Stanford finally broke through with a 35-yard touchdown pass from West to Fehoko early in the fourth quarter, giving them a 17-14 lead. However, Northwestern was not deterred and responded immediately with a 12-play, 75-yard drive that ended with a 2-yard touchdown run from Ramsey. The Wildcats' defense held strong on Stanford's final two possessions, forcing a turnover on downs and then intercepting West on the Cardinal's last drive to seal the upset victory. Ramsey finished the game with 234 passing yards, two touchdowns, and one interception while also adding 35 rushing yards on the ground. Wide receiver Ramaud Chiaokhiao-Bowman was Ramsey's favorite target, hauling in six catches for 73 yards. Evan Hull led the ground attack with 79 rushing yards and one touchdown. Defensively, the Wildcats were led by linebacker Paddy Fisher who had 11 tackles, one sack, and one forced fumble. Safety Brandon Joseph also had a standout performance with eight tackles and one interception. Head coach Pat Fitzgerald was thrilled with his team's performance, stating ""I'm so proud of these guys. We knew it was going to be a battle coming into Stanford, but our defense played lights out and our offense executed when it mattered most. This is a big win for our program and we're excited to build off of it."" The upset victory over a ranked opponent will undoubtedly give Northwestern a boost heading into the rest of their Big Ten schedule. They will look to carry this momentum into next week's matchup against Duke.","EVANSTON -- Northwestern got three field goals by Jack Mitchell and a touchdown run by quarterback Clayton Thorson to upset No. 21 Stanford 16-6 in a season-opening game for both teams Saturday. Thorson, a redshirt freshman making his first career start, completed 12 of 24 passes for 105 yards. The 6-foot-4, 220-pound quarterback rushed for 68 yards on eight carries, including a 42-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. Sophomore Justin Jackson rushed the ball 28 times for 134 yards to lead the Wildcats, while Stanford starting running back Christian McCaffery carried 12 times for 66 yards and fumbled once. Senior Christian Jones, who missed last season with a knee injury, caught five passes for 52 yards to lead Northwestern receivers. Georgia 51, Louisiana-Monroe 14 ATHENS, Ga. -- Although the ninth-ranked Bulldogs weren't perfect and mistakes were made, they simply had too much offensive firepower and used it to roll over the Warhawks. Georgia sophomore Heisman Trophy candidate Nick Chubb picked up where he left of, rushing 16 times for 120 yards and two touchdowns while Greyson Lambert made his debut as the Bulldogs' starting quarterback and completed 8 of 12 passes for 144 yards and two scores, including one each to Malcolm Mitchell and Jeb Blazevich. Keith Marshall also enjoyed a big day. After playing in just three games last year after tearing his ACL in 2013 against Tennessee, Marshall rushed 10 times for 73 yards with two touchdowns. Ole Miss 76, UT-Marin 3 OXFORD, Miss. -- Chad Kelly threw two touchdowns in the first half and the No. 17 Rebels rolled to a convincing win. Kelly dazzled the crowd of 60,186 fans at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium from the start, completing pass after pass to a wide array of weapons at his disposal. Kelly, the nephew of NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly, completed his first touchdown pass to Markell Pack. It covered 56 yards, with the majority of it coming through the air down the middle of the field. Kelly finished the first half 6-for-10 for 178 yards and he made up for an interception he threw in the third by running for a score a few minutes later. Kelly wasn't the only Rebel skill player who shined Saturday. Running back Jaylon Walton scored the first two times he touched the ball, while wide receiver Laquon Treadwell returned from a season-ending injury in 2014 in seamless fashion. Clemson 49, Wofford 10 CLEMSON, S.C. -- Sophomore Deshaun Watson, playing in his first game since suffering a torn ACL last November, got off to a solid start, completing 18 of 22 passes for 194 yards and two touchdowns in limited duty as the No. 12 Tigers rolled past Wofford. While Watson appeared completely healed from ACL surgery last December, the Tigers' post-game concern focused on the health of junior wide receiver Mike Williams. He snagged a 4-yard touchdown pass from Watson to cap Clemson's game-opening drive, but suffered a neck injury on the play when he collided with the goalpost support. Williams remained on the ground for approximately 15 minutes before being placed on a stretcher and carted off the field. Williams, who led Clemson with 1,030 receiving yards last season, raised his right arm as he left the field, but was hastened to a nearby hospital for evaluation."

Many cities are implementing new laws to combat the sale of counterfeit goods, drug paraphernalia, and other illicit items.

By enforcing stricter regulations on vendors, cities can reduce the sale of counterfeit goods and protect consumers. Lastly, cities are taking steps to combat drug paraphernalia sales. These regulations require stricter monitoring of vendors to reduce the sale of dangerous drug paraphernalia to minors.

The Tigers opened the season on the road against the Missouri State Bears, falling 2-0 in a game that saw the offense generate just four shots on target. The Bears were in control throughout the game, piling up 16 shots on goal and keeping the Tigers' attack at bay. In their second game of the season, the Tigers returned home to face the Illinois Fighting Illini. Despite playing in front of a raucous crowd, the Tigers were unable to get anything going offensively, managing just one shot on target and ultimately falling 3-1. Tigers head coach Peter Carpenter expressed his disappointment with the team's performance in both games. ""We've got a lot of work to do,"" said Carpenter. ""We knew going into the season that we had a lot of new players and that it was going to take some time to build chemistry, but we didn't expect to struggle this much."" One of the biggest problems for the Tigers has been their inability to finish scoring chances. Through two games, the team has managed just one goal, a penalty kick converted by senior midfielder Jack Johnson in the loss to Illinois. ""We've got to find a way to put the ball in the back of the net,"" said Carpenter. ""We're creating chances, but we're not capitalizing on them. That's something we have to fix if we're going to be successful this season."" The Tigers' defense has also been an issue through the first two games. The team has given up five goals, with several of them coming from defensive breakdowns and missed assignments. ""We need to be better defensively,"" said senior defender Kyle Davis. ""We've been giving up too many easy goals, and that's something we can't afford to do if we want to win games."" Despite the early-season struggles, the Tigers remain confident that they can turn things around. With a talented group of players and a coaching staff that has a track record of success, the team is focused on making improvements and getting back on track. ""We know we're capable of playing better than we have been,"" said Johnson. ""Now it's just a matter of putting in the work to make that happen. We're not going to let these two losses define our season."" The Tigers will have a chance to get their first win of the season when they take on the Tulsa Golden Hurricane on Friday. While the team knows that it will be a tough test, they're ready to rise to the challenge and show what they're capable of. ""We're looking forward to the opportunity to get back on the field and compete,"" said Carpenter. ""We know we have the talent to win games, and now it's just a matter of executing and putting everything together."" If the Tigers can fix their offensive and defensive issues and start stringing wins together, they could still have a successful season. But if their struggles continue, it could be a long and frustrating season for the team and its fans.","Freshman midfielder Mason Morise (number #17 in the photo) has scored the lone goal for Memphis in two games this season. Photo by Joe Murphy The Memphis Tigers men’s soccer team knew they were in for a challenge in Friday night’s season opener against UAB, so while the 3-1 loss wasn’t what the Tigers hoped for it wasn’t any cause for concern either. That may have changed a little bit Monday afternoon following Memphis’ 1-0 loss at home to Northern Kentucky, who finished 6-10-4 against a relatively weak schedule a season ago. The loss gives Memphis an 0-2 record on the young season, and with three road games against difficult teams coming up next on the schedule the Tigers will have to figure things out sooner rather than later. Perhaps the most notable issue with the Tigers in the early goings of the season has been the team’s finishing ability, or lack thereof. In both losses Memphis has out-shot their opponents — 21-8 vs. UAB and 13-9 against Northern Kentucky. However, of those 34 shots only one has resulted in a goal. “The quality in the final third again for the second straight game wasn’t there, and I think to correct that you just get on the practice field and work on crossing and finishing, as basic as that is,” head coach Richard Mulrooney said about the team’s finishing in the first two games. “We are creating the opportunities. It’s just a matter of finally putting the ball in the back of the net.” Despite scoring only one goal in two games, Memphis’ offense has actually been pretty solid. The Tigers are controlling possession for stretches and are able to set up goal-scoring opportunities. Once the U of M is able to actually finish those opportunities they should be fine, but until that happens they’re going to need spectacular performances from the defense to have a shot at winning games. Much like the offense, the defense has been doing its job outside of one glaring weakness — set pieces. Of the four goals given up by the Memphis defense, three have come as a direct result of a corner or free kick. In the opener, the Tigers were tied 1-1 with UAB until the Blazers scored twice in two minutes off of two set pieces. Set piece offense is something of a specialty for the Blazers — Mulrooney likened it to the NBA’s Golden State Warriors and three-point shooting — but then Monday afternoon the Blue and Gray found themselves victims of a set play score yet again when Northern Kentucky’s Calvin Murphy headed in a free kick in the 64th minute for the game-winner, signaling that it could be a problem with Memphis’ defensive execution rather than just the opponent’s proficiency. “In the box we have to be tighter and fight for the ball, because obviously we are being beaten to the ball and physically beaten in getting on the end of those, and it’s just a matter of that’s unacceptable,” Mulrooney said. “You have to have a will to stop the other team, and obviously we haven’t gotten that yet.” Mulrooney is also experimenting with making personnel changes on the defensive end, with sophomore Jake Leeker earning the start in goal Monday afternoon in place of incumbent senior Cody Uzcategui. The head coach noted that there was a close race between the two in preseason for the starting goalkeeper job, and he could continue to give both players looks until one asserts himself as the man for the job. Outside of small mistakes the Tigers played well enough to win both of their first two games, and with a difficult upcoming schedule failure to capitalize on those opportunities could come back to bite them. Memphis’ next four games all come on the road, and each is against a 2014 NCAA Tournament team. The U of M will face No. 14 Saint Louis, SIU-Edwardsville, Kentucky and No. 15 Louisville in the difficult stretch, and if the current issues aren’t corrected the Tigers could easily see their two-game slide snowball into a much longer streak. The Tigers are familiar with each of their next four opponents except Kentucky, having faced Louisville in an exhibition last season and defeated both SIU-Edwardsville and Saint Louis in the regular season. According to Mulrooney, both the familiarity with the opponents and the added pressure of needing a win could bring the best out of the Tigers in the difficult games this weekend. “I see it as just a big challenge, I really do,” the second-year head coach said. “I don’t see it as something that we can’t overcome. These next two games are teams that we beat last year, and I know that’s last year and I know it was at home, but the confidence should be there that we can play with these teams because we did it last year.” Memphis will travel to St. Louis to take on the Billikens Friday evening, with kickoff set for 7 p.m. The Tigers will then have a quick turnaround before playing SIU-Edwardsville at 1 p.m. Sunday."

263,"In today's world, we are surrounded by a seemingly endless array of things to buy. From gadgets and gizmos to clothes and cosmetics, there's always something vying for our attention and our wallets. But what if I told you that there's a mental glitch that's making us spend more than we really should? It's called the ""anchoring effect,"" and it's something that we all need to be aware of if we want to avoid being taken advantage of by retailers. The anchoring effect is a cognitive bias that's based on the idea that humans tend to rely too heavily on the first piece of information we receive when making decisions. So, for example, let's say you're shopping for a new car. You might look at the prices of a few different models and settle on one that seems like a good deal. However, if you had started your search by looking at a really expensive car first, the prices of the other models might suddenly seem much more reasonable by comparison. This same concept can apply to all sorts of purchasing decisions, from big-ticket items like cars and houses to smaller, everyday purchases. And retailers are well aware of the anchoring effect, and they use it to their advantage in a variety of ways. One common tactic is to show a high-priced item first, with the hope that it will anchor your expectations for the rest of the products in the store. For example, if you walk into a clothing store and see a jacket priced at $500, everything else in the store will seem like a bargain in comparison. Even if you end up buying a jacket that costs $250, you'll likely walk away feeling like you got a great deal. Another way that retailers use the anchoring effect is by setting a ""regular"" price for an item that's much higher than its actual value. They'll then slash the price and offer it at a discount, even though the discounted price may still be higher than what the item is really worth. This is why it's important to do your research and know what the going rate is for a particular product before you start shopping. Of course, retailers aren't the only ones who can take advantage of the anchoring effect. We can do it to ourselves, too. For example, if you're shopping for a new laptop and you see one that costs $1,500, it might anchor your expectations for the rest of the laptops you see. Even if you end up finding a perfectly good laptop for $1,000, it may seem like a bargain by comparison. So, how can we avoid falling prey to the anchoring effect? Here are a few tips: 1. Do your research: Before you start shopping, research the products you're interested in and find out what their typical prices are. This way, you'll have a better idea of what's a good deal and what's not. 2. Take a break: If you feel like you're getting anchored on a particular price point, take a break and come back to it later. This will help you reset your expectations and avoid making an impulse purchase. 3. Shop around: Don't settle for the first product you see. Instead, shop around and compare prices at different stores to make sure you're getting the best deal. 4. Focus on value: Instead of just looking at the price tag, focus on the overall value of a product. Is it well-made? Will it last a long time? These factors can often be more important than the actual price. In conclusion, the anchoring effect is a mental glitch that can make us spend more than we really should. By being aware of this bias and taking steps to avoid it, we can make smarter purchasing decisions and get the best value for our money. So, the next time you're out shopping, remember to keep your guard up and don't let retailers anchor your expectations.","Psychologists have identified a mental glitch that exposes us financially. Photo: Robert Zuckerman Touchstone Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer, Inc. Source: Supplied THOUSANDS of struggling Australians are trapped in a debt vortex with cards maxed out and no way of getting out of the red. The Consumer Action Law Centre’s financial counselling helpline receives more than 5000 calls a year from people struggling with credit card debt, with 50 per cent facing bills of more than $10,000. “Every week, we hear from someone with credit card debt exceeding $100,000,” said the centre’s policy officer Katherine Temple told the Federal Government’s credit card inquiry, which held its second hearing in Melbourne yesterday. And it’s not just the vulnerable or uneducated who are at risk of being sucked in, she said; a simple psychological glitch puts us all at risk. The “optimism bias” kicks in when we are weighing up our options to make a purchase or financial decision. That Gucci bag isn’t going to pay for itself. Source: Supplied Put simply, it means that we over-estimate our ability to pay for something in the future if we don’t have to worry about it for the time being. It makes us less likely to care about a higher interest rate that will kick in 12 months down the track, or to factor in the possibility that an unforeseen disaster could obliterate our ability to pay. “It’s quite calculated,” said Ms Temple. “We need structural change, to make sure people aren’t being given credit cards that they can’t afford to repay.” Ms Temple said tougher lending rules were needed, to stop banks from heaping massive debt on people who would never be able to pay them off. “The optimism bias means that we have a tendency to over-estimate our capacity to pay,” she said. “That’s why balance transfers are so attractive — it’s basically free money (in people’s minds).” The Australian Securities and Investments Commission acknowledged this phenomenon in its submission to the inquiry, noting: that “people with strong optimism or present biases might begin with the intention of always paying off their balance in full and, based on this intention, may disregard the interest rate on a card in the belief they will not need to pay any interest.” If Carrie Bradshaw was real, there’s a fair chance she’d be calling a debt crisis line. Source: News Corp Australia Consumer advocates say the banks are taking advantage of human nature, profiting from the mental glitch that leaves us vulnerable. Ms Temple said that along with clearer product descriptions, credit card providers should be forced to base their eligibility assessment on whether the customer can pay off the maximum limit in full, to account for consumers’ behavioural biases. “At the moment, it’s based on whether you can pay the monthly minimum,” she said. “So if something happens — like job loss, or you get sick, or you have a relationship breakdown — you can find yourself in trouble.” Like Carl Cavarra, the out-of-work tradie who is facing potential bankruptcy over a $90,000 debt. The 34-year-old owes thousands on five different credit cards, on top of a hefty car loan, all approved while he was working fulltime as a bricklayer. And while he was able to afford the minimum payments on these debts while employed, a bad turn of luck left him stuck in a debt spiral. After seven years of physical labour, the bricklayer suffered a triple hernia that required surgery, bed rest — and left his earning capacity in limbo. Despite incurring the injury through repeated heavy lifting on the job, Mr Cavarra said, WorkCover deemed his case one of “wear and tear”, so he received no compensation. On doctor’s orders, he abandoned his career, moved back in with his parents and started an unsuccessful 10-month search for a new job. Melbourne’s Carl Cavarra is facing potential bankruptcy over his $90,000 debt. Source: NewsComAu Unable to make his $1600 monthly loans repayments while living on a $489 a fortnight Centrelink allowance, Mr Cavarra found himself racking up even more debt by putting his living expenses on his credit cards — which have interest rates of between 18 and 23 per cent. In the end, the cards were maxed out and the creditors came knocking. “I’ve asked to consolidate my debts so I can make one payment, but the banks refuse,” he said. “They want it paid off in five years, but that’s impossible.” Without a job — despite having applied for hundreds this year — he was not eligible for a balance transfer. “I reckon if I don’t find a job by the end of this year, I will have to go bankrupt. I don’t want to do that.” It’s this situation that the Consumer Action Law Centre argues should be prevented by more stringent lending rules. While it may have been imprudent for Mr Cavarra to saddle himself with so much debt, not giving himself leeway for unforeseen circumstances that could impact his ability to pay, he is far from alone. Australians owe a collective $32 billion on their credit cards , with the average card holder paying $700 a year in interest on debts that hover around $4,300. And many of them have no idea how much interest rate they are paying; a survey of 2200 credit card users by ME bank found that 73 per cent did not know their interest rate and 40 per cent did not know if their card had an annual fee. Inquiry chairman and Labor senator Sam Dastyari accused the banks of running a “confusopoly”, with credit cards marketed in a way that makes it hard for consumers to work out whether they are getting a good deal, amid all the bells and whistles of reward points schemes and promotions. Consumer group Choice called for credit card advertising to include the monthly cost for a consumer with an average card balance, in dollars, based on the interest rate and annual fee. The credit card inquiry will report its finding to the Senate Economics References Committee by November 24.

264,"Nigeria's economy has received a boost with the distribution of N72 billion by the Federal Government to states and local governments as monthly allocation for the month of September. This move has been hailed as a positive development that will help sustain positive sentiment in the country. According to the Director of Information in the Ministry of Finance, Mr. Charles Nwodo, the money was distributed based on the revenue generated the previous month. He said the distribution was in line with the Federal Government's commitment to ensuring transparency and equitable sharing of resources among all tiers of government. The distribution of the funds to the states and local governments is expected to help facilitate development in various sectors of the economy, including education, healthcare, infrastructure, and security. The move will help boost economic activity in the country, as well as provide much-needed employment opportunities for the country's large youth population. Many experts have welcomed the move, saying it will help sustain positive sentiment in the country. They note that the distribution of the funds will help alleviate the financial burden at the state and local government levels, allowing them to focus on development and other important issues. The distribution of the funds comes at a time when the country is facing numerous challenges, including insecurity, youth unemployment, and a struggling economy. The government has taken various measures to address these challenges, including launching various social intervention programs aimed at empowering the youth and boosting economic activity. The government's ""Ease of Doing Business"" initiative has also helped to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) into the country. This, in turn, has helped to create job opportunities and generate revenue for the economy. However, despite these initiatives, there is still much work to be done to address some of the country's major challenges. The government has been urged to take more drastic steps to improve security in the country, as well as to provide more support to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are important drivers of economic growth. Experts also urge the government to invest more in infrastructure, particularly in the transportation sector, to help facilitate the movement of goods and services across the country. This will help to reduce the cost of doing business, as well as enhance economic activity. In conclusion, the distribution of the N72 billion by the Federal Government to states and local governments is a positive development that will help sustain positive sentiment in the country. The move will help to alleviate the financial burden at the state and local government levels, allowing them to focus on development and other important issues. The government must continue to take bold steps to address the country's major challenges, in order to create an environment that is conducive to economic growth and development.","Lagos — It was a three-day trading week as the Federal Government of Nigeria declared Thursday 24th and Friday 25th of September, 2015 as Public Holiday in commemoration of the Eid-el-Kabir Sallah Celebration.

265,"As global economic uncertainties continue to loom overhead, the Australian dollar (AUD) is expected to take a further dip in the coming months, with some analysts predicting that it may even hit the 60 US cents mark. This recent prediction comes after the AUD fell to 67.77 US cents earlier this week due to concerns over the ongoing US-China trade war and a slowing global economy. The currency has been hovering around the 67 to 68 US cents mark for the past few months, but it has now reached a new low. Analysts believe that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) may further cut interest rates in the near future, which could push the AUD even lower. Some are predicting a rate cut as early as next month, which would bring Australia's official cash rate to a record low of 0.75%. The RBA has already cut rates twice this year to stimulate the economy, but it seems that more may be needed to offset the negative impact of global economic uncertainties. The US-China trade war, Brexit, European economic weakness, and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have all contributed to a slowdown in global economic growth. This slowdown has had a direct impact on Australia's economy, with both the mining and agriculture sectors experiencing difficulties. The housing market has also been struggling, with prices falling in major cities such as Sydney and Melbourne. The weak housing market, in particular, is a concern for the RBA as it has a direct impact on consumer spending and confidence. This could further harm economic growth and push the AUD down even further. Despite the gloomy economic outlook, some experts believe that the AUD may recover slightly in the latter half of 2020. This is due to the potential easing of trade tensions between the US and China, as well as a potential resolution to Brexit. However, this optimism may be short-lived if the global economic situation worsens. The AUD remains vulnerable to external economic factors, making it difficult to predict its future movements. In conclusion, the AUD is expected to take a further dip in the coming months, with the potential to hit 60 US cents. The RBA may need to cut interest rates further to stimulate the economy, but this may not be enough to offset the negative impact of global economic uncertainties. Until there is some resolution to these uncertainties, the AUD will remain at risk of further decline.","That trip to the US is going to get more expensive because the Aussie dollar is headed downwards toward 60 US cents in the coming year. Recent share market turmoil, worries about the Chinese economy and the looming interest rate rise by the US Federal Reserve have sent financial institutions scrambling to downgrade their Australian dollar forecasts. All of the big four banks, and most of the others, now say it will drop well below 70 US cents in the coming six months. The Aussie dollar has lost around a quarter of its value in the past 12 months, from 94 US cents last September. AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver is one of the many predicting the Aussie dollar could fall further. ""Notwithstanding occasional bounces, the broad trend in the Australian dollar is likely to remain down as the Fed is still likely to raise rates sometime in the next six months,"" he said. ""The Australian dollar is expected to fall to 60 US cents in the next year or so, with the risk that it will go even lower."" Dr Oliver said the large share market falls of late aren't over, which will put added downward pressure on the local currency. The good news is that a lower Australian dollar boosts exports by making them cheaper, increases tourism from overseas and makes locally produced goods more competitive with imports. UBS economists Scott Haslem and George Tharenou said tourism was already emerging as one of the economy's bright spots. ""The Australian dollar's steady move lower from over parity with the US dollar in mid-2011 has been a key driver, and its sharp decline over the past month is likely to underpin a further pick-up in tourism activity,"" UBS said. ""For overseas arrivals, growth has picked up from being flat in 2011 when the Australian dollar was near parity."" St George was the only institution surveyed by AAP to say that the Aussie dollar would be above its current level of 71 US cents by the end of the year. ""In our view, markets have taken an overly pessimistic view on the outlook for China, the domestic economy and interest rates,"" senior economist Janu Chan said. ""We are maintaining our end-of-year forecast at 73 US cents, but we recognise that downside risks exist for our forecast while sentiment remains fragile."" Ms Chan said that while a rebound in the Australian dollar was likely, she didn't expect a sustained rally. ""It will likely come under downward pressure over the course of 2016, as the tightening cycle of the Federal Reserve takes hold and we expect the Australian dollar to track close to 70 US cents throughout early next year."""
266,"The picturesque town of Sausalito, nestled on the northern edge of the San Francisco Bay, has long been a popular destination for visitors. With its stunning views, charming houseboats, and quaint streets dotted with art galleries and boutiques, it's easy to see why tourists flock to this idyllic haven. However, in recent years there has been a growing concern among locals about the impact of tourism on the town's sustainability. Sausalito, with a population of just over 7,000, welcomes nearly one million visitors each year. While the influx of tourists brings in revenue for local businesses, it also puts pressure on resources and raises questions about the town's ability to maintain its unique character and integrity. One significant way in which tourism impacts Sausalito is through transportation. Visitors usually access the town by car or by ferry, and both options can be problematic. Traffic can be heavy, particularly on weekends and holidays, causing congestion on already narrow streets. Additionally, the increased number of vehicles means more carbon emissions, which contribute to climate change. On the other hand, the ferry system, while more environmentally friendly, has limited capacity, which can lead to overcrowding and long wait times, particularly during peak season. In response to these challenges, Sausalito has implemented several initiatives to promote sustainable tourism. One of the most successful is the Sausalito Free Shuttle, which runs seven days a week year-round and is funded by the city's Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT). The shuttle offers a convenient and eco-friendly way for visitors to get around town and reduces traffic congestion. It also encourages visitors to park their cars outside of town and take the shuttle in, further reducing the number of vehicles on the roads. Another effort to promote sustainable tourism is the Green Business Program, which recognizes local businesses that meet high environmental standards. To be certified, a business must meet criteria in areas such as waste reduction, energy conservation, and water conservation. Currently, 25 Sausalito businesses are certified as green, and the program is continuing to grow. The city has also implemented measures to reduce the impact of plastic waste. In 2018, Sausalito passed an ordinance banning the use of single-use plastics such as straws, utensils, and stirrers throughout the town. The move was celebrated by environmental groups, who noted that plastic waste is a major contributor to ocean pollution. By banning single-use plastics, Sausalito has taken an important step towards reducing its environmental impact. While these initiatives are commendable, some residents feel that more needs to be done. In a recent survey conducted by the Sausalito Chamber of Commerce, nearly 60% of respondents indicated that tourism had a negative impact on the town's character and quality of life. Many locals point to the proliferation of short-term vacation rentals, which they say contribute to a transient population and often result in noise and disturbances. Others have raised concerns about the impact of cruise ship tourism. During the summer months, Sausalito sees an influx of cruise ship passengers, who disembark for a few hours to explore the town before returning to their ships. While these visitors provide a boost to local businesses, they also add to traffic congestion and make it difficult for locals to park and move around town freely. Despite these challenges, Sausalito remains committed to promoting sustainable tourism. The town recognizes the importance of tourism to its economy, but also acknowledges that it must be managed in a way that preserves the town's unique character and protects its resources. By implementing initiatives such as the free shuttle, the green business program, and the ban on single-use plastics, Sausalito is taking important steps towards achieving this goal. Looking to the future, Sausalito is exploring new ways to further promote sustainable tourism. One idea under consideration is the addition of pop-up parklets, which would provide additional outdoor seating for local restaurants while also creating more public space. The town is also considering expanding its ferry service to reduce overcrowding and improve access. As tourism continues to grow in Sausalito and around the world, it's important for destinations to prioritize sustainability. Sausalito's approach, which combines environmental stewardship with economic vitality, offers a promising model for other towns and cities to follow. By working together, we can ensure that our favorite destinations remain vibrant, beautiful, and accessible for generations to come.","How does a small town like Sausalito (7,000 residents) take advantage of tourism and the economic benefits it generates, but also manage the influx of visitors? How do we provide the infrastructure to support and welcome a million visitors every year, but not be overwhelmed by them? It’s called “sustainable tourism” and in my opinion it is an attainable state; it has in fact been very successful in other communities. There are lessons to be learned. The tourists are not going to go away. Sausalito is a world class destination. No one wants to be the “anti-tourist, unfriendly” Marin County city. Even Sausalito civic leaders will say they are not opposed to tourism as they recognize the fiscal benefits associated with it. But most agree it needs to be better managed; whether it’s the bicyclists descending into town after an iconic ride across the Golden Gate Bridge, the hundreds of thousands getting off the ferry from San Francisco every year (it is, after all ranked by travel writers as the second most spectacular ferry ride in the world) or those arriving by car to dine along the waterfront, or catching a shuttle to the legendary Muir Woods. Sausalito is a gateway to the famous California wine country and west Marin. It is a popular and much heralded destination – by land or by sea. To be clear, I am not opposed to tourism. I am proud of what Sausalito has to offer and believe our city could not thrive as it does without the dollars these visitors bring to town. Between the Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) that the city collects from restaurants, hotels and retailers (over a $1 million a year) and the other taxes and fees that businesses in Sausalito generate, it is estimated that 50% of the City’s operational budget is derived from local business, specifically the tourist/hospitality industry in town. Sausalito would be hard pressed to find alternative resources to fund their infrastructure improvements, parks, libraries and other city services if it weren’t for the income our visitors generate. Managing Not Deterring Tourism I do believe that Sausalito needs to manage its tourism industry better and not deter it. A bike valet program is great, but right in the middle of an already congested three-block area in the center of town? The city needs to move the masses from this crowded area of downtown where the ferry lands, the buses park and the taxis wait. Spreading the transport support system even a few blocks further north would ease the current grid lock. Driving more commerce to Caledonia and other parts of town is not a bad idea as it expands Sausalito’s corridor of commerce. Staging shuttles and bike parking at Cavallo Point or further north, offering ferry and water taxi service in other areas, taking advantage of bicycle trailers where tourists can drop their bikes and not worry about getting them back to the city are all possible solutions. Even investing in infrastructure and improvements in the Marin Ship (red flag, red flag!) would all be wise considerations. I am not suggesting we pave paradise and put up a parking lot, but a walking and bike path along the shoreline would help relieve some of the downtown congestion. No one wants taxis and tour buses taking over neighborhoods or souvenir shops and bars displacing pharmacies and green grocers as they have in Venice and Barcelona. Sausalito has done a decent job of controlling growth through their zoning – no big box stores or “chain stores” have been allowed for years; ostensibly, only independent retailers are allowed (although the formula retail ordinance is often loosely interpreted and needs revision). Tour buses are required to exit town to the north, not the south; there are more bike racks; there are bicycle ambassadors. The Chamber has done a stellar job of assisting with the downtown congestion via their information kiosk and working with Golden Gate Transit to manage the bicycle loading on and off the ferries. I am not suggesting that nothing has been done. There is at long last even a Marin Ship Steering Committee to suggest revisions to the Marin Ship plan which is seriously outdated. Strides have been made; just not enough or fast enough. Low Volume-High Value Tourism In a great New York Times article by Elizabeth Becker (July 17, 2015), the author chronicles how other cities are tackling the problem. Denmark, she notes, welcomed over 9 million tourists last year; they have a population of fewer than 6 million. They have “quiet zones” in residential sections of Copenhagen; they have prohibited foreigners from buying vacation homes in their coastal areas and they have a bicycle-friendly transportation system to include tourists and locals alike. In France, the most visited country in the world, tourism has actually contributed to the protection and nurturing of the country’s culture, landscape and quality of life. As Becker writes: “In practical terms, that means tourism is promoted and subsidized, but also regulated, at all levels of government, in all matters of policy.” The Effiel Tower is the most heavily visited paid attraction in the world, with 7 million visitors a year. Tickets are limited and timed, security it discreet but significant, loitering is forbidden and street vendors are strictly regulated. Paris is first and foremost for Parisians but still welcomes and manages its tourists. Sausalito should do the same. Granted these are larger cities, but the issues are the same and perhaps more dramatic in a smaller town such as Sausalito. The key concept is low volume, high value tourism quality vs. quantity. More discerning visitors who spend more time and more money in town and low impact local businesses that drive high-volume dollars. Clearly there needs to be more conscientious consideration at City Hall when it comes to what sorts of businesses are let into town. Business should be resident serving as well as tourist friendly. Campaigns that target more high value tourism and generate tourist traffic during off-seasons and mid-week could help, as would special events in slower seasons that bring well-heeled visitors to town. Sausalito has a limited number of hotel rooms and even fewer large event spaces, but by targeting corporate meeting planners, destination management companies and bringing in small to medium groups on expense accounts who stay for more than an ice cream cone and a day seems to be a viable approach for cultivating a different tourist clientele. Leadership at City Hall Most importantly, as I have noted in previous blog posts, there needs to be more leadership at City Hall, more governance and more effort to promote sustainable tourism. There is a city appointed Hospitality Committee, a Business Advisory Committee, a Chamber of Commerce – there are many bodies in place that can work together to better balance the impact of tourism. And they need to be supported by our civic leaders. While I am all for managing tourism in a sustainable fashion, I am not an advocate of the current petition circulating in Sausalito which calls for a ballot initiative next year which would force City Hall to adopt a plan for dealing with tourism. In my mind, tourism is a constant issue for the city, it should always be on their agenda and a serious budget issue based on the demand it places on city services, but not something forced by the voters in an election year. City Hall should always be working on striking a balance and achieving sustainable tourism. The City of Sausalito should adopt a better plan, as residents have argued, but making it a ballot issue politicizes an already divisive town further in my mind. I do however agree with local resident Russ Irwin however, when he says “tourism will shape us if we don’t shape it.”"

269,"In a largely partisan vote, the House of Representatives rejected the Iran Nuclear Deal, a landmark international agreement aimed at preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. The agreement, negotiated by the Obama administration and other world powers in 2015, lifted economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for the country's promise to limit its nuclear program. The House vote, which passed 226-194, largely fell along party lines, with all Republicans and several Democrats voting against the deal. Opponents of the deal argued that it did not go far enough in limiting Iran's nuclear capabilities and that it failed to address other issues, such as Iran's support for terrorist organizations. Proponents of the deal, including President Obama, argue that it is the best option for preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and that it is a necessary step towards achieving peace in the region. The rejection of the Iran Nuclear Deal by the House is largely symbolic, as the agreement is already in effect and is being honored by Iran and other world powers. However, the vote does demonstrate the continued partisan divide over foreign policy issues and the impact of politics on international diplomacy.","WASHINGTON (CNN) – A day after the Senate secured President Barack Obama’s Iran nuclear deal, blocking a Republican resolution to scuttle it, the GOP-led House pressed forward with a pair of votes designed to show a majority of the chamber disapproves of the agreement. The votes can’t prevent the administration from starting to implement the agreement later this month, but Republicans want to send a political message. A bill approving of the nuclear deal was resoundingly defeated, with 25 Democrats joining House Republicans in expressing opposition to the pact. One Republican, Kentucky Rep. Tom Massie, voted “present.” On a second vote largely along party lines, the House passed legislation stating that the President could not unilaterally lift statutory sanctions. The measure was non-binding, and Senate Republicans have no plans to advance the bill. The vote was 247 to 186, with two Democrats voting with Republicans. Paving the way for a possible legal challenge, the House passed a non-binding resolution on Thursday stating that the President violated the law by not giving Congress the details on “side deals” to the nuclear agreement related to inspections of Iranian sites, which are government by secret arrangements between Tehran and the U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency."
270,"Humacyte, the clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel tissue therapies, has announced that its Founder, Dr. Laura Niklason, will be joined by Board Director Dr. Robert Langer in addressing the 4th TERMIS World Congress in Boston. The Congress will take place from September 4th to 7th, 2021. The TERMIS World Congress is a leading international event that brings together scientists, clinicians, and industry leaders to present the latest advances in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. This year's event, which is expected to draw over 2,000 attendees, will feature more than 1,500 presentations and 200 exhibitors. Dr. Niklason, who is also a Professor of Anesthesiology and Biomedical Engineering at Yale University, will be presenting on Humacyte's proprietary technology for manufacturing human acellular vessels (HAVs), which are being developed for use in vascular access for hemodialysis, vascular grafts, and other regenerative medicine applications. Dr. Langer, who is the David H. Koch Institute Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), will be speaking about his groundbreaking work in the fields of tissue engineering and drug delivery. Dr. Langer is a pioneer in the development of controlled-release drug delivery systems, as well as in the creation of biomaterials that can be used to regenerate tissues and organs. Humacyte's HAVs are created from natural extracellular matrix proteins that are seeded with the patient's own cells, allowing the vessels to integrate more seamlessly with the patient's own tissue. The vessels are designed to have a low immunogenicity profile, meaning that they are less likely to be rejected by the patient's immune system. Humacyte's technology has the potential to revolutionize the field of vascular access for hemodialysis, which is currently dominated by synthetic grafts. In addition to its work in vascular access, Humacyte is also developing tissue-engineered replacements for various other body parts, including heart valves, esophagus, and knee meniscus. The company's technology has shown promise in preclinical studies, and has already undergone successful clinical trials in Europe. Humacyte recently announced that it has raised $75 million in a Series C funding round to support the advancement of its pipeline of tissue-engineered products. The funding was led by the longevity-focused investment firm Vickers Venture Partners, and included participation from other prominent investors such as Point72 Ventures, Venrock Healthcare Capital Partners, and Alexion Pharmaceuticals. ""We are thrilled to have the opportunity to present our latest data on our HAV technology at the TERMIS World Congress,"" said Dr. Niklason. ""We believe that our technology has the potential to transform the field of vascular access, and we look forward to sharing our progress with the scientific community."" ""We are excited to have Dr. Niklason and Dr. Langer join us at the TERMIS World Congress,"" said Congress Chair Dr. Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic. ""Their work in the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine has been instrumental in advancing the field, and we are eager to hear about their latest developments."" Humacyte is currently in the process of submitting a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its HAVs, and anticipates filing for regulatory approval in Europe later this year. The company's tissue-engineered heart valves are also in advanced preclinical development, and are expected to enter clinical testing in the near future.","RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C.--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Humacyte, Inc., a pioneer in biotechnology and regenerative medicine, announced today that company founder, Laura Niklason, M.D., Ph.D., and Robert Langer, Ph.D., Humacyte Board Director and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Institute Professor, will deliver keynote addresses at the 4 th TERMIS World Congress.

271,"Work can be a demanding and stressful environment, not only for the body but especially for the mind. With long hours at the office, deadlines, and never-ending piles of work to complete, it can be challenging to focus and retain a sense of wellbeing. The harsh reality is that without proper precautions taken to find balance and ease the mind, burnout can and will occur. The good news is that there are simple yet effective ways to rejuvenate yourself at work, and give yourself the break you need to return being more productive and energized than ever. First things first, acknowledge the importance of taking breaks. Many people have the mindset of trying to get as much done as possible, even if that means sacrificing their own mental and physical health. However, counter-intuitively, breaks are essential to productivity. Research shows that long periods without taking a break can decrease productivity and diminish the quality of work. Without proper breaks, the work becomes monotonous, and the mind becomes exhausted. Therefore, it's vital to take breaks when needed. Secondly, be mindful of the type of breaks you take. Taking a break does not mean escaping all productivity entirely, but rather creating a balance between the work and the break. Taking a break could involve going for a quick walk around the office, taking a quick yoga class during lunchtime, or simply switching from the primary task you've been working on to another task. These types of breaks are restorative, as they allow you to take your mind off the work and give it some rest. The idea is not to remove yourself from the work entirely but to re-energize the mind. Additionally, consider incorporating short breathing exercises into your daily routine. Proper breathing techniques are essential in calming the mind, reducing stress and anxiety, and increasing productivity. It only takes a minute or two, but it can have a significant impact on your overall wellbeing throughout the day. Another great way to rejuvenate yourself is by simply getting some sunlight. Research shows that vitamin D obtained from the sun improves mood, focus, and overall performance. If you work in an office setting, take a break to step outside and bask in the sun's rays for a few minutes. Sunlight is not only good for the soul, but it's also beneficial to the body. While on break, you can also make use of your company's wellness program. Many companies have developed wellness programs to help employees attain a healthier lifestyle. These programs can range from health monitoring to nutrition, fitness, and even meditation. These programs are usually free, and they are beneficial, both for the employee and the employer. Utilize these programs to rejuvenate yourself, and more importantly, it could lead to great health benefits in the long run. Lastly, consider incorporating short yoga sessions during your work breaks. Yoga is an excellent way to rejuvenate the mind, reduce stress levels, and detoxify the body. Doing your yoga sessions while at work, either alone or with a group, can make it easier to work and maintain the psychological and physical boundaries between the work and the break. You don't have to be a master yogi, but incorporating yoga into your daily routine can be highly beneficial. In conclusion, taking short breaks to rejuvenate yourself during work can help you maintain mental equilibrium and prevent burnout. The type of breaks you take should be instrumental in reducing stress levels and relaxing the mind. Incorporating daily breathing exercises or short yoga sessions can have a significant impact on your relaxation, focus, and overall wellbeing. Making use of your company's wellness program is also highly beneficial. Ultimately, it's important to acknowledge the significance of breaks, and their potential to boost productivity and help you maintain a healthy work-life balance.","Back in June, during my first few weeks in my new job , my days were busy. Extremely busy. So busy, in fact, that pretty much every minute of every workday was filled with a meeting to attend or a task to accomplish. Other than the occasional quick restroom break, I spent all of my time those days either at my desk or in a meeting room. I even ate lunch at my desk while trying to catch up on work. Anytime you start a new job, you spend the first few weeks drinking from the proverbial firehose, so I wasn't surprised by how busy I was. And to be honest, I found the learning process exhilarating and exciting, if also a bit exhausting. Now that I'm about three months into the new gig, the days are still quite busy, but they have grown more manageable. That means I'm able to take short breaks during the day, sometimes escaping our freezing office space to thaw out with a walk around the block or stretching my legs with a quick jaunt through the hallways of the building. These breaks always help me gather my thoughts, refocus on the tasks I've got to do next and prepare mentally for the coming block of work time. Personal experiences like these have made me a big believer in the benefits of breaks. I see them as little opportunities to build work-life balance in the middle of an average day at the office. As such, I was interested to read the results of a new study on work breaks from two researchers in Baylor University’s Hankamer School of Business. According to a Baylor press release about the study, researchers Emily Hunter and Cindy Wu, associate professors of management, surveyed 95 employees (ages 22-67) over a five-day workweek. Each person was asked to document each break he or she took during that time, excluding bathroom breaks. Hunter and Wu then analyzed a total of 959 break surveys, or an average of two breaks per person per day. They said in the press release that the results of the study should be beneficial to both managers and employees. “We took some of our layperson hypotheses about what we believed were helpful in a break and tested those empirically in the best way possible,” Hunter said in the release. “What we found was that a better workday break was not composed of many of the things we believed.” Page 2 of 3 - For example, many residents of Cubeville like to push through their mornings, staying busy and delaying any breaks until lunchtime . I often find myself in that situation. But Hunter and Wu found that a break earlier in the workday replenishes more of an employee's resources of energy, concentration and motivation. “We found that when more hours had elapsed since the beginning of the work shift, fewer resources and more symptoms of poor health were reported after a break,” the study said. “Therefore, breaks later in the day seem to be less effective.” They also found that better breaks incorporated activities that employees preferred, even if those activities were work-related. “Finding something on your break that you prefer to do — something that’s not given to you or assigned to you — are the kinds of activities that are going to make your breaks much more restful, provide better recovery and help you come back to work stronger,” Hunter said in the press release. I've definitely found this to be true. If I'm working on an assigned task during a break — like reading a report during lunch — it doesn't feel like a break at all. But if I spend that downtime on a work or personal project of my choice, I'm much more refreshed and rejuvenated when the break is done. And that's important, because the study also found that taking good breaks led workers to experience fewer maladies like headaches, eyestrain and lower back pain at work. Employees who took good breaks also had better job satisfaction and less burnout, according to the study. This is definitely information bosses should ponder. The team I manage is an incredibly hard-working group, and I worry that they're going to get burned out . If I pay more attention to their schedules and encourage them to take breaks — and model that behavior myself — perhaps I can help them avoid that problem. But how long should breaks last to be beneficial? Unfortunately, the Baylor study didn't have a solid answer to that question, although the research did seem to find that more frequent, shorter breaks were associated with more positive outcomes for workers. “Unlike your cellphone, which popular wisdom tells us should be depleted to zero percent before you charge it fully to 100 percent, people instead need to charge more frequently throughout the day,” Hunter said in the press release. That makes sense to me. After all, no one likes a dead battery. I'd be interested to hear your reactions to this study. How often do you take breaks during the workday, and when do they usually occur? How long do they last? What kinds of breaks are most beneficial to you? What suggestions would you offer to people who aren't sure how to manage their work breaks? Page 3 of 3 - Send me an email or leave a comment online, and I'll share some of your responses in a future column. And one more thing. If you're looking for a quick break every Tuesday morning, reading my column would probably give you a solid 5-7 minutes away from the daily grind. Just saying."
272,"Sebastian Vettel admitted to being pleasantly surprised by the margin of his pole position as he edged out a resurgent Lewis Hamilton in a thrilling qualifying session for the Spanish Grand Prix. The German, who had been struggling for form in recent weeks, found his stride at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya to claim his first pole position of the season and first since last year’s Mexican Grand Prix. In doing so, Vettel denied Hamilton his fourth pole position in five races and sounded a warning to his rivals that he is back in the hunt for the championship. ""It feels really good,"" said Vettel. ""Obviously, we had a good day today, especially this afternoon, and that’s what you look for. We had a difficult weekend in Baku, but we learned from it and came back stronger here."" Vettel’s lap of 1:16.173 was just 0.132 seconds quicker than Hamilton’s best effort, but it was enough to give him the advantage over his Mercedes rival. ""I’m surprised by the margin, but I’m not complaining!"" Vettel added. ""It's always great to start from pole, but it's just one step. The race is tomorrow and we need to focus on that. It’s a long race and tyre management will be key, so we’ll see how it goes."" The Ferrari driver was full of praise for his team after the session, thanking them for the hard work they had put in to make the car competitive. ""I’m really happy for the team,"" he said. ""We’ve been working hard to try and improve the car and today was a good step forward. We know we have a lot of work to do, but we’re going in the right direction."" Vettel’s pole position sets up a tantalising showdown between him and Hamilton on Sunday, with both drivers desperate for the victory that would give them the early advantage in the championship race. Hamilton, who won the previous race in Azerbaijan, was gracious in defeat and praised Vettel’s performance. ""Sebastian did a great job today,"" said the reigning world champion. ""He deserved the pole position and we’ll have to work hard to try and beat him in the race. It’s not the end of the world starting second, but it’s not ideal. We’ll give it everything we’ve got tomorrow."" Behind Vettel and Hamilton on the grid will be Valtteri Bottas, who qualified third in the second Mercedes, and Max Verstappen, who was an impressive fourth for Red Bull. Charles Leclerc continued his impressive start to the season by qualifying fifth for Ferrari, while Romain Grosjean confirmed the resurgence of Haas by taking sixth. The two Renaults of Nico Hulkenberg and Daniel Ricciardo will start seventh and eighth, ahead of Lando Norris in the McLaren and Kimi Raikkonen in the Alfa Romeo. With the top four separated by just 0.866 seconds and the top ten by less than a second, Sunday’s race promises to be one of the closest of the season so far. But it is Vettel who will be the man to beat as he bids to lay down a marker in the battle for the championship.","Paul di Resta analyses both Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton's qualifying for the Singapore GP Sebastian Vettel has admitted his surprise at defeating Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton by over a second in qualifying for the Singapore GP to claim Ferrari's first dry pole in five years. The four-times world champion produced one of the laps of the year to register the Scuderia first pole position since 2012 and the team's first in dry conditions since F1 visited Singapore in 2010. It was also the German's first pole since Brazil 2013. Remarkably, not only did Vettel claim pole by half a second from Daniel Ricciardo with his Ferrari team-mate Kimi Raikkonen a further two tenths adrift, but he beat the fifth-placed Lewis Hamilton, chasing a record-equalling eighth consecutive pole in F1, by over 1.4 seconds. With Nico Rosberg a place behind Hamilton, it was, by a distance, Mercedes' worst result of F1's new turbo era. ""It's a surprise. I thought they were sandbagging because there's no doubt they have the strongest package this year,"" said a startled Vettel. ""They must have some issues. ""But I wouldn't rule them out for tomorrow. It's not the easiest circuit to overtake, but if you have the pace you can come through. So I expect them to be strong tomorrow."" It would certainly be foolish to write off Mercedes but Ferrari, closely followed by Red Bull, appear to have boasted a significant pace advantage all weekend with Vettel consistently a step ahead of Raikkonen and the chasing pack. But why? Ferrari introduced a brand-new upgraded engine two weeks ago at Monza, a change which immediately coincided with better single-lap pace from the Scuderia. However, the team are adamant that their new engines couldn't have been a factor in their unexpected superiority under the Marina Bay lights. ""The effect of horsepower around here is about point one of a second so it's inconceivable you could make that sort of difference with horsepower,"" a bemused but delighted James Allision told Sky Sports F1. ""The gap to Red Bull is more or less what it should be around this sort of track but the strange thing is how slow the Mercs were."" Sebastian Vettel celebrates after landing his first pole for Ferrari in Singapore So was it a case of Ferrari making gains while Mercedes lost their way to create the perfect qualifying storm? While a frustrated Hamilton attributed his lack of speed to gripless tyres, Mercedes boss Toto Wolff admitted his team were at a loss to understand the scale of their defeat. ""Shocked is probably not the right word but we are very surprised,"" said Wolff to Sky Sports F1. ""We have been surprised from the beginning onwards. We start with a certain simulation and what you expect from the track and somehow it hasn't worked. It could be many various factors. We've been very good for two years and not put a foot wrong but this time it was a step backwards."" Yet the last word must go to Vettel as the German celebrated his first pole position in Ferrari colours. ""It's a street circuit and the better you feel, the closer you get to the walls, the quicker you can go,"" he added. ""It's a circuit where the driver can make the difference.""

273,"For many law students across the country, the pandemic has led to a year of virtual classes, cancelled internships and disrupted job prospects. But as the world slowly begins to open up again, it’s time to face the reality of a post-pandemic legal job market. As more law firms and legal departments begin to hire again, students need to start thinking about how to craft the perfect application, tailor their skills to the modern reality of legal practice and stand out from the crowd. One key area of focus for students should be their digital skills. As many firms embrace remote working and virtual communication, it’s more important than ever to showcase your ability to navigate online collaboration tools, produce high-quality digital work and communicate effectively in a remote setting. Make sure to highlight any relevant experience with these skills on your resume and cover letter. Another crucial element to consider is networking. As more networking events transition to virtual settings, take advantage of online platforms to connect with legal professionals in your desired field. Attend webinars, engage with speakers on social media and join online groups to build connections that could lead to valuable opportunities down the line. But don’t just rely on digital networking; make the effort to attend in-person events as well. Many firms are returning to hosting in-person events, such as open houses and recruiting events, and there’s no substitute for making a personal connection with a potential employer. Above all, students should focus on building their legal careers with an open mind and an adaptive approach. The pandemic has changed the legal industry in unprecedented ways, and it’s up to students to adapt to the shifting landscape. One example of this adaptation can be found in the rise of legal tech. As firms look for ways to streamline their operations and improve efficiency, many are turning to technology such as document automation and artificial intelligence tools. Students who can demonstrate proficiency in these areas will be highly sought after in the coming years. While the job market may seem daunting in the wake of the pandemic, there are still plenty of opportunities for ambitious law students to make their mark. By focusing on digital skills, networking and adaptability, students can position themselves as top candidates for exciting legal roles in firms and legal departments across the country. It won’t be easy, but with the right mindset and a willingness to put in the work, the legal world is open for business once again. So here’s to a successful return to reality, and the exciting opportunities that await for the next generation of legal professionals.","Fresh from my late summer vacation, I’m back in rainy London, in the process of enrolling for the Legal Practice Course (LPC). The impending return to lectures, seminars and routine is as welcome as it is worrisome. On the one hand, I am keen to return to actually having plans for that involve something other than socialising and drinking. On the other hand, I am keen to retain spending every day drinking and socialising! But on a serious note, I do want to continue hurtling towards the moment of qualifying as a solicitor. Aside from my return to responsibility land, another source of apprehension is the mixed reviews I’ve heard about what the LPC is like. Some have told me it’s easy; others have said it’s too hard and a third group, seemingly unfazed by its difficulty, have told me it’s just plain boring. None of these adjectives inspire confidence, but I’m determined to enter the course with an open mind and report back to my reader(s) as objectively as possible! So far, points to note are that the University of Law (ULaw) uses Office365 instead of Gmail (which my univeristy used) as its email client... which is a fairly cluttered email provider, from my previous experience of it. In addition, ULaw uses an online learning environment called Blackboard as opposed to the Moodle I got used to at Greenwich. Thus far, neither of these banal facts have confirmed or denied the aspersions previously cast to me. Speaking of reporting back, while I was in Canada I did actually go to a court room and watch a Canadian court case! (Sad right?) I mean, there’s a slightly less sad explanation in that the judge was my friend’s old boss, but I feel this will not prevent the decrease in my coolness levels right now… as if it were ever high! In any case, it was largely the same as a court in the United Kingdp, – what with Canada being a common law country, this is unsurprising – however, there was slightly less formality. No one said ""your lordship"", ""my learned friend"" or other deferential terms. In all, it seemed slightly more conversational in style – but nevertheless equally as nerve-wracking for the lawyers, I’m sure. Also, the lawyers didn’t wear gowns, just suits – not even darkly coloured suits at that (the horror)! The court was also massive compared to the ones I’ve seen in the United Kingdom, spanning (if I remember correctly) six floors – everything is bigger on the other side of the Atlantic. So fair reader(s), don’t say I don’t spoil you with stories of my adventures to far-flung corners of the globe! On that jaw-dropping story, I shall return to recovering from jetlag and enrolling to begin the LPC that starts in a couple of weeks, stay tuned! "

Despite rumors that the two would collaborate during the tour, Rihanna explained that it's simply not possible due to scheduling conflicts. In a recent interview with Elle, Rihanna said, ""I'm busy working on my own projects right now, so unfortunately I won't be joining Taylor on stage. But I'm a huge fan of hers and I know she's killing it on tour."" While fans may be disappointed at the news, it's clear that Rihanna's focus is on her own music and career at the moment. The singer is currently working on new music, as well as expanding her successful Fenty beauty and fashion lines. Regardless of whether or not Rihanna joins Swift on stage, it's clear that both artists will continue to be major players in the music industry for years to come.","Rihanna has said she doesn’t ever see herself performing with Taylor Swift, because they just “don’t match”.

Taylor recently had a string of stars join her on stage for her world tour, from Justin Timberlake and Wiz Khalifa to Cara Delevingne and Selena Gomez. Asked if she would appear with Taylor if invited, Rihanna said: “I don’t think I would. I just don’t think it makes sense.

Proactive vs. Reactive - A Better Approach to Cloud Security — November 3, 11:00 - 11:35 am By Stephen Coty Organizations from small to large are increasingly adopting cloud solutions to deliver essential business services at a much lower cost. According to cyber security experts, the frequency and severity of cyber-attacks are on the rise, causing alarm to businesses and customers across a variety of industries. To defend against exploits like these, a company must adopt a comprehensive security defense strategy that is designed for their business. In 2015, organizations such as United Airlines, Sony Corp, Anthem and the Office of Personnel Management experienced data breaches through malware and other targeted attacks. How will your business adapt to this shift in technology while keeping its security posture? In his session at 17th Cloud Expo , Stephen Coty, Chief Security Evangelist at Alert Logic, will take you into the evolving world of cybercrime and give you an insider's look into the tactics utilized by fast, well-funded and organized attackers.

Containers and microservices have become topics of intense interest throughout the cloud developer and enterprise IT communities. Microservices focuses on the business and technology of the software architecture design pattern, in which complex applications are composed of small, independent processes communicating with each other using language-agnostic APIs. Containers are not being considered for the first time by the cloud community, but a current era of re-consideration has pushed them to the top of the cloud agenda. Rather than just stuff an OS into a container, for example, developers and deployers should consider a spectrum of microservices and what they can do.

The producer, who has been working in the television industry for over two decades, is no stranger to the Emmys race. ""I have a deep respect for the Emmys and what it represents,"" they added. ""But when I see shows like 'House of Cards' and 'Homeland' get nominated year after year, it makes me question the integrity of the process."" The producer was particularly scathing of ""House of Cards,"" which he said has become ""unwatchable"" and ""more like a parody of itself than a serious drama."" ""It's like they've run out of ideas but are too afraid to admit it,"" the producer said. ""The first season was groundbreaking, but now it's just a caricature of what it used to be. The characters are unlikable and the plot is predictable."" The producer also had strong opinions about ""Homeland,"" a show that was once lauded for its intelligence and unpredictability. ""It started out strong, but now it's just a soap opera with terrorists,"" the producer said. ""The plot twists are forced and the characters have become caricatures of themselves. It's a shadow of what it used to be."" The producer's comments have sparked a fierce debate in the television industry, with some defending both shows as still being relevant and groundbreaking. ""'House of Cards' may not be as fresh as it once was, but it still has some great performances and a compelling story,"" one industry insider said. ""And 'Homeland' continues to be an important commentary on the state of American foreign policy."" Others, however, have agreed with the producer's harsh critique. ""I've been saying the same thing about 'House of Cards' for years,"" one television critic said. ""It's time for the show to end before it becomes a joke."" As for ""Homeland,"" another critic said, ""It's sad to see a show that once had so much promise become so predictable and boring."" The debate over the quality of these shows, and whether or not they should continue to be recognized by awards like the Emmys, will undoubtedly continue. But one thing is for sure: this anonymous producer's brutal honesty has sparked a much-needed conversation about the state of television and the importance of pushing boundaries and taking risks.","This story first appeared in the Sept. 25 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

All of the roughly 19,000 members of the TV Academy belong to one of 29 ""peer groups"" (i.e., actors, writers, etc.) and are entitled to vote for the nominees — and, as of this year, also the win­ners — in the categories that pertain to their specific area of expertise; for series categories, all members vote. THR 's awards analyst Scott Feinberg spoke with one producer who has won an Emmy himself but who has no ties to this year's nominees to learn how he voted — and why. OUTSTANDING DRAMA SERIES I would have dumped Homeland , House of Cards and Downton Abbey and put in Bloodline , which was incredibly well done; The Good Wife , which made a really strong comeback this year and would have been nominated if it was on cable or a streaming service; and — don't laugh — Daredevil , a comic book show done ridiculously well that features the most watchable actor on television, Vincent D'Onofrio — in $5,000 suits! Downton Abbey , I confess, is not a show I watch; I've sampled it but I cannot get through it — I'd rather have hemorrhoid surgery. I wrote ""WTF?"" next to Homeland 's nomination; its first two seasons were as good as anything on television, but as soon as they — spoiler alert — hanged [ Damian Lewis during season three], it stopped being watchable and sort of became the drama version of the Tim Robbins show [ The Brink ]. I'm glad Orange Is the New Black , which has incredibly fresh performances and direction, was moved to the drama category; shows written in a room by comedy writers should compete against each other, but Orange isn't written that way and isn't that kind of a show. Kudos to Netflix for giving really creative people free range, which is how the best work gets made — although it also can go terribly wrong, as in the case of House of Cards . I binge-watched the first season in two days and was a huge fan; then it had a weak second season; and then it totally jumped the shark this season — I was literally looking around for Henry Winkler , a small pool, a shark and a motorcycle. They just lost their way with a Sam and Diane moment: [ Kevin Spacey 's Frank Underwood] wants to be president in the worst way — and they made him president! Don't. Do. That. (It did have one good episode, the season finale, thanks to Michael Kelly , who was the only reason I kept watching.) I did not expect Better Call Saul to get nominated, but it absolutely deserves to be in there. Mad Men will probably win for its last season, which was very good — I liked that they didn't wrap everything up in a bow but also didn't just cut to black like The Sopranos . But Game of Thrones is the most important show on television. The scale of it and the amount of talk it generates is unparalleled; nobody wants to get to Monday without having seen what happened on Sunday, and that takes me back to the way TV was when I was growing up. MY VOTE Game of Thrones (HBO) OUTSTANDING COMEDY SERIES I'm delighted Parks and Rec was nominated — there's an unfortunate prejudice against broadcast network shows, but Amy Poehler 's work was outstanding and the cast is extraordinary. Silicon Valley and Transparent should have been nominated — [ Silicon 's] T.J. Miller plays one of the funniest characters on television and [ Transparent 's] Judith Light is one of the most underappreciated actresses out there. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is terrific, but I was surprised it made it. I adore Modern Family and would have voted for it for the first three seasons, but it's now being nominated on its reputation — it did not have a very good season. Veep is a nice comedy — Julia Louis-Dreyfus is amazing — but I don't think the show is Emmy-worthy. (I would've taken out Modern Family and Veep and replaced them with Black-ish and Jane the Virgin .) But the bottom line is, there's Louie and then there's everything else. I don't understand how it hasn't already won. It's so groundbreaking and original; we'll look back on it as one of the great comedy series of all time. MY VOTE Louie (FX) 'Louie' OUTSTANDING LIMITED SERIES First of all, it's nice to see a limited series category, but they still need to figure out what it means — it's like the three-card monte game of the Emmys. It should be easy to distinguish a limited series from a series: If you have a giant staff of writers and you're putting out a show with a different director every week, and you have actors who have contracts with options for multiple seasons, you're a series, and you shouldn't be able to compete as a limited series; if one or two guys are doing six or eight or 10 hours, you're a limited series. American Horror Story , which is not really my thing, is an out-and-out series — it's had a continuous writing staff, supervising director and EP. The same actors appear in every season and know, when they wrap one, that they're coming back for another — maybe as a different character in a different story, but so what? The same was true for The Twilight Zone , which was a drama series. Putting a colon in the title and changing the subtitle every year does not make you a limited series — and gives you the same sort of unfair advantage that putting "" Hallmark Hall of Fame: "" at the front of titles used to, which is frustrating for people who actually make limited series. American Crime is coming back, so it should be a drama series, but I liked it very much. I would never have nominated Wolf Hall or The Honorable Woman — they were like watching paint dry. HBO shows get nominated because they're on HBO, which spends an enormous amount of money telling America: ""We're not TV. We're HBO."" And it has worked — people internalize that and then vote for something in a category like this solely because it aired on HBO. There is no way Olive Kitteridge , with its pedantic pacing and obtuse storytelling, would have gotten the number of nominations it did — or would win, which it's going to — if it was on any other network. I'm going with American Crime , mainly because I can't vote for The Missing , which was the best thing on television this year. The fact that it wasn't nominated illustrates why it was a mistake to get rid of the blue-ribbon panels, which I used to serve on, for the nominations phase of voting. I didn't even know The Missing existed until someone told me to watch the screener, and thankfully Starz sent screeners of the whole thing, unlike some networks that send episodes one and seven or whatever ran­dom selections. MY VOTE American Crime (ABC) 'American Crime' OUTSTANDING TV MOVIE There are a lot of really hard-working TV movie producers out there and the mission of the Television Academy is to celebrate people like them who work in television every day — come to work, put on their headset and do everything they can to make movies in probably the most difficult genre left in our business. I think about the number of places that made TV movies 10 years ago and the number of places that make them now, and I take my hat off to the people who are still doing it. So what do they do? They nominate two feature films [ Grace of Monaco and Nightingale ] that just couldn't get theatrical releases and give them two slots that could have gone to people who actually make TV. Furthermore, are we really still so in love with the Brits that we're nominating stuff like Agatha Christie's Poirot: Curtain, Poirot's Last Case ? Prime Suspect is one thing, but are you kidding me — Poirot for the 400th time? I watched 15 minutes of it and fell asleep. Peter Ustinov put that to bed. I didn't care for Hello Ladies or Killing Jesus — I wish they had nominated Whitney , which had a stunning main performance. That leaves Bessie , which is absolutely a deserving winner. MY VOTE Bessie (HBO) 'Bessie' OUTSTANDING VARIETY SKETCH SERIES I think SNL had a really off year — they're obviously the institution, but they're slacking. I love [ Inside Amy Schumer 's ] Amy Schumer — she goes right out to the edge of the diving board every episode and never falls off, and her 12 Angry Men parody was the best episode of any of these shows. Portlandia and Drunk History are hit or miss. I voted for Key & Peele because it's the funniest show on television and I am so crushed they are going off the air — they are completely original, completely without parameters and will go after anyone in an unbelievably clever way. MY VOTE Key & Peele (Comedy Central) OUTSTANDING VARIETY TALK SERIES I can't quarrel with any of these nominees. [ Jimmy ] Kimmel and [ Jimmy ] Fallon are really good and reshaping the format — and I don't know why anyone would ever host an Emmys or an Oscars with some­one other than one of them. With [ Stephen ] Colbert , [ Jon ] Stewart and [ David ] Letterman all saying goodbye this year, this is sort of the farewell-tour category. I'm a dedicated Stewart fan — he changed the game and will always be the gold standard — but I think he was sort of mailing it in this year, as Letterman has been doing for several years. (I would have been happy to replace Letterman and Colbert with Conan [ O'Brien of Conan ] and [ Real Time 's Bill ] Maher .) But in my opinion, the best show, week to week, was John Oliver 's. Granted, he has a whole week to prep his show, while the others have to do four or five a week — but I imagine all those other guys also work with much bigger writ­ing staffs, which sort of evens the playing field. MY VOTE Last Week Tonight With John Oliver (HBO) OUTSTANDING REALITY COMPETITION PROGRAM Boring. These are the same nominees every year and I wouldn't choose to watch any of them — I have never seen So You Think You Can Dance or Project Runway , but I have watched Amazing Race , Dancing With the Stars and The Voice because they have been on in my house. I called up my family and asked them what I should vote for and they told me The Voice , which I found acceptable because I do think [creator] Mark Burnett is the Ed Sullivan of our day. But at the end of the day, does anyone besides the people who make these shows really care? The Amazing Race has won 10 out of the 12 years: They're like the Celtics in the '60s — I don't know why anybody else bothers to suit up. MY VOTE The Voice (NBC) OUTSTANDING STRUCTURED REALITY PROGRAM I have seen every one of the nom­inated shows except Property Brothers . I'm a fan of MythBusters , but it's been on a long time and they've sort of run out of myths. There have been episodes of Undercover Boss that I've liked, but each one really depends on whether or not they've found a great boss. Nothing comes close to Shark Tank . I'm a huge Mark Burnett fan, and this one is so well done that its title has now become part of the lexicon. And any time I can see Mark Cuban berating other billionaires, how would I not be into that? MY VOTE Shark Tank (ABC) OUTSTANDING UNSTRUCTURED REALITY PROGRAM I don't watch any of these reg­ularly. I saw two episodes of Wahlburgers on an international flight when there was nothing else left to watch on my little TV. And I've seen a few episodes of Intervention and I respect what they do for people battling addiction. MY VOTE Intervention (A&E)"
277,"DORKING - The new year has brought with it a wave of uncertainty for Dorking, with many locals anticipating that the town will face an uphill struggle in 2022. According to local business owners, the rising cost of living and the ongoing pandemic are just two of the factors that are making this year particularly challenging for the town. ""We've already seen a lot of local businesses struggling to stay afloat,"" says Samuel Jones, who runs a small retail store in the area. ""The cost of everything, from rent to utilities, keeps going up, and it's difficult for small businesses like ours to keep up."" In addition to the financial pressures, many locals are also concerned about the ongoing pandemic and the impact it will have on the town's economy. ""We've already had a number of local events cancelled or postponed, and it's not clear whether they will be able to go ahead later in the year,"" says Alice Carter, a local event planner. ""This uncertainty can be tough for businesses that rely on these events to bring in customers."" Despite the challenges ahead, however, many locals remain optimistic about the future of Dorking. ""There's a real sense of community here, and people are willing to support each other in tough times,"" says James Smith, a long-time resident of the town. ""We've faced challenges in the past, and we'll face them again, but I'm confident that we'll come out stronger."" One potential bright spot for the town is the recent announcement of a major regeneration project, which is set to bring new investment and development to the area. ""The project is still in the planning stages, but it has the potential to transform the town and bring in new opportunities for businesses and residents,"" says John Brown, a local councillor who has been involved in the project. The project will focus on the town centre and is set to include new shops, restaurants, and affordable housing, as well as improvements to public spaces and transport links. While the project is still some time away from completion, many locals see it as a positive sign for the future of the town. ""It's reassuring to know that there are plans in place to invest in the town and make it a better place to live and work,"" says Sarah Green, a local teacher. ""I think we'll see some tough times in the year ahead, but I'm hopeful that we'll come out stronger on the other side."" As the new year unfolds, it remains to be seen what exactly the future holds for Dorking. But with support from the community and new investment on the horizon, there are reasons to be optimistic about the town's long-term prospects.","READY TO GO: Dorking's Richie Andrews Comments (0) RICHIE ANDREWS says Dorking are looking in good shape as they prepare for their second season in National League Two South. The Red & Whites host Cambridge in their opening game of the season on Saturday as they look to build on a fourth-place finish in an impressive debut campaign at step four. It could have been even better, with Dorking falling out of play-off contention in the latter stages of last season, with three defeats costing them dearly in the winter months. But while Dorking's director of rugby (pictured) says it would be good to push for promotion again this time around, he says he is realistic about the competition from other ambitious clubs at the level. ""We are looking forward to it and it would be nice to go better than last year, but we know it will be tough,"" he said. ""We are an amateur team among a division of semi-professional sides at a very good level and we did a good job last season in getting to where we did. ""It would be disappointing to do worse than last season, but there are several teams like Worthing [Raiders], Old Albanians, Chinnor and Cambridge who are really hoping to be in with a shout at the end of the year."" Dorking welcome one of the much-fancied sides to the Big Field this weekend, with Andrews expecting a much different Cambridge side to the one they faced in the division last season. ""Cambridge will be a tough test,"" he said. ""They have been quite vocal about the calibre of players they are recruiting and I am expecting a lot tougher test than last year. ""It is nice to be starting at home and we are looking forward to getting started."" And Andrews is happy with how his squad is shaping up for the new campaign, despite picking up a few knocks in pre-season. Dorking have welcomed Benji Marfo, Mofe Wilkey, Harry Elbrow and Matt Betty into the squad over the summer, while Zach Woodcock and Stuart Watkins are set to make the step up to the senior squad this season. And although senior duo Will Crow and Ross Grimstone have departed for pastures new, Andrews is hoping a reasonably settled squad can work to their advantage. ""Our new players are looking good and have settled in well,"" he said. ""They are looking comfortable with how we play and the structures in place. ""We are also still producing homegrown talent and we have options for selection this week, and it is about getting the right combinations. ""Yes, there are other teams who have gone out and recruited big numbers and experienced players, but I genuinely believe that it will help us in the first few weeks to have a settled squad that knows each other and how they play. ""We will do our best to go out there and win every Saturday, but there is no pressure on us to get promoted."""

281,"The NRL Premiership Tournament has reached its quarter-finals, and the intensity is only getting stronger. Four teams have already advanced to the semi-finals, and the remaining four teams will compete to earn their spot in the next round. Let's take a closer look at each of the quarter-final matchups. The first quarter-final will feature the Melbourne Storm and the Parramatta Eels. The Storm had an outstanding season, finishing in first place with a 20-4 record. The Eels had a slightly bumpier path, but still finished in a respectable fifth place with a 14-10 record. The teams have already met twice this season, with the Storm winning both times. However, the Eels will be hungry for revenge and will look to capitalize on their momentum from a convincing win in the previous round. The second quarter-final will see the Penrith Panthers take on the Sydney Roosters. The Panthers were dominant during the regular season, finishing in second place with a 18-6 record. The Roosters, on the other hand, had a somewhat disappointing season by their high standards, finishing in sixth place with a 12-12 record. However, they have a history of stepping up in the playoffs, and the Panthers will need to be on their A-game to avoid an upset. The third quarter-final features the South Sydney Rabbitohs and the Newcastle Knights. The Rabbitohs finished in third place with a 16-8 record, while the Knights just scraped into the playoffs with a 10-14 record. However, the Knights have shown they can compete with the best, as evidenced by their upset win over the Sydney Roosters in the previous round. The Rabbitohs will need to be on guard to avoid a similar fate. Finally, the fourth quarter-final will pit the Canberra Raiders against the Cronulla Sharks. Both teams had identical 10-14 records during the regular season, but the Raiders earned a higher place in the standings due to their superior points differential. The Sharks will be looking to pull off an upset, while the Raiders will be hoping to continue their recent run of good form. One thing that all four quarter-final matchups have in common is that they promise to be entertaining and hard-fought contests. Each team has worked hard to earn their spot in the playoffs, and they will be giving it their all to advance to the next round. The playoffs also offer players and coaches the chance to make a name for themselves. The spotlight is brighter, the stakes are higher, and there is no room for error. The stars of the NRL will need to step up and lead their teams if they want to compete for the ultimate prize. Fans of the NRL will be eagerly anticipating each of the quarter-final matchups, as they provide a glimpse of what's to come in the rest of the playoffs. The league has seen plenty of drama and excitement this season, and there's no reason to expect anything different in the final few weeks. Throughout the playoffs, each team will have to overcome their own challenges, whether it's dealing with injuries, handling pressure or adapting to their opponents' styles. But the teams that come out on top will be the ones that can work as a team and execute their game plan to perfection. Overall, the NRL Premiership Tournament has been a thrilling ride so far, and it's only going to get better as the playoffs continue. The quarter-finals offer a fascinating preview of what's to come, and fans of rugby league will be glued to their screens to see who comes out on top. It's sure to be an exciting finish to an already incredible season.","VideoImageTaupau should remain a Tiger4:01 NRL: Steve Roach joins Fox Sports News to discuss the NRL Finals and the situation surrounding the possible release of Martin Taupau. September 17th 20153 hours ago/video/video.news.com.au/Sport/NRL/ Nick CamptonThe Daily TelegraphShareShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on Google+Share on RedditEmail a friend THE votes are in, the surveys have been tallied and the first round of the NRL Premiership Tournament is in the bag. There were a couple of shock losses, a couple of big wins and a couple of match ups that went right down to the wire. We’ll kick off the quarterfinals with a quick recap of Round 1 before diving into the new match ups. • The closest match of the first round was the 2007 Storm and the 2013 Roosters. The Roosters lead for most of the voting period but Melbourne surged back over the weekend to take out the match with a 50.18% share of the vote — or by a margin of just nine votes. • The 2002 Roosters also went down in their other clash against the 2003 Panthers with Penrith winning another nail biter after getting 50.88% of the vote. In something of a shock result, both Roosters teams have been bounced in the first round. • Newcastle enjoyed the most lopsided victory in Round 1 when they belted the 1999 Storm after gaining 71.88% of the vote. • When our Random Match Generator (also known as picking the teams out of a hat) threw up the Manly vs. Manly clash in Round 1 it raised more outcry than a Daly Cherry-Evans backflip, but in the end the people of the Northern Beaches voted with their clicks and sent the 2008 Sea Eagles through to the quarterfinals. They trashed their 2011 counterparts after gaining 70.74% of the vote and given the feedback on Facebook and Twitter they’d be considered one of the favourites to go all the way. • Brisbane fans came out in force with the 2006 Broncos earning 62.66% of the vote to smack the 2005 Tigers, the 1998 premiers downing the 2014 Rabbitohs after getting 59.44% of the vote and the 2000 Broncos bringing the pain against the 2012 Storm, running away with 62.27% of the vote. • True to form, the 2004 Bulldogs are flying right under the radar and got past the 2010 Dragons with 55.38% of the vote. On to the quarterfinals VETERAN: OUT: Pearce succumbs to hamstring injury 2003 Penrith Panthers vs. 2006 Brisbane Broncos 2003 Penrith Panthers Season record: 21-6 Wins by 1-12: 12 Wins by 13+: 9 Average winning margin: 11.76 Wins over top eight teams: 13 Despite surging to the minor premiership and winning an incredible 20 of their last 23 games, the 2003 Panthers were counted as title outsiders right up until grand final day. Their average winning margin of 11.76 is the lowest of any team still in contention but they have the equal highest number of wins over top eight sides. 2006 Brisbane Broncos Season record: 17-11 Wins by 1-12: Five Wins by 13+: 12 Average winning margin: 17.47 The 2006 Broncos have the worst overall record of any of the teams remaining and are the only team left who lost more than 10 matches. They also boast the longest losing streak of any team left in the tournament after they dropped five matches on the trot between Round 18 and Round 23. Their average margin of victory is a respectable 17.47, which places them firmly in the middle of the pack, but the 2006 Broncos have the look of a team that was competitive without being dominant in the regular season who managed to hit form at just the right time to surge into the title picture. 1998 Brisbane Broncos vs. 2007 Melbourne Storm 1998 Brisbane Broncos Season record: 21-6-1 Wins by 1-12: Seven Wins by 13+: 14 Average winning margin: 24.48 Wins over top eight teams: 10 After the first week of the Premiership Tournament it was clear that the 1998 Broncos were overwhelmingly strong title favourites and when we dig into the stats we can see why. They have the third greatest number of 13+ wins among remaining teams and the highest average winning margin. While these numbers are impressive, it’s worth remembering what kind of competition the NRL was in 1998. In the bloated, newly united competition there were 20 teams, which meant that the footballing talent was spread way too thin. This created a serious world of the haves and the have nots, and nobody had more than Brisbane. That’s not to say the 1998 Broncos were flat track bullies, but all stats need to be examined in the proper context. 2007 Melbourne Storm Season record: 24-3 Wins by 1-12: Nine Wins by 13+: 15 Average winning margin: 19.21 The decision to include a Melbourne team that was over the salary cap was controversial to say the least, but their clash with the 1998 Broncos promises to be one for the ages. This Storm side have the best record of all remaining teams and the second highest number of 13+ wins. Throw in an equal-highest 13 victories against top eight teams and its easy to see why they’re one of the stronger teams still in contention. Winning 16 of their last 17 and outscoring their finals opposition 100-18 wasn’t too shabby either. MAGIC: SHARKNADO: Cronulla charter fan flight to Townsville 2008 Manly Sea Eagles vs. 2001 Newcastle Knights 2008 Sea Eagles Season record: 20-7 Wins by 1-12: Three Wins by 13+: 17 Average winning margin: 21.85 Wins over top eight teams: Nine With the exception of the 1998 Broncos, no team got more love in Round 1 than the 2008 Sea Eagles. While they weren’t able to snag the minor premiership, they did record the highest number of 13+ wins among active teams with an incredible 17. They also have the second highest average margin of victory with 21.85, but notably only beat nine top eight teams all season, the lowest total among teams still in contention. One of the real strings to their bow remains their imperious run through the finals, where they outscored their opposition 110-12 in possibly the most dominant finals series ever. 2001 Newcastle Knights Season record: 19-9-1 Wins by 1-12: 10 Wins by 13+: Nine Average winning margin: 19.23 Wins over top eight teams: 10 Statistically, the 2001 Knights were the second best attacking team of all time (trailing only the team the beat in the grand final, the 2001 Parramatta Eels) but their pointscoring aptitude isn’t really reflected in the stats. Their average winning margin of 19.23 is good without being great and their 10 wins over top eight teams is of similar standard. This team definitely had an attitude that the best form of defence was more offence, while their 19-9-1 record is the second worst of any of the teams still in contention. 2000 Brisbane Broncos vs. 2004 Canterbury Bulldogs 2000 Brisbane Broncos Season record: 21-6-2 Wins by 1-12: Nine Wins by 13+: 12 Average winning margin: 19.05 Wins over top eight teams: 11 The 14-team competition that came about in 2000 meant that talent was more highly concentrated and, on the whole, teams had much more depth than they had in the chaotic Super League years. As a result, the 2000 Broncos average winning margin of 19.05 and 11 wins over top eight teams, which are both good enough for fourth among remaining teams, are ever more impressive. Minor premiers by six points, they might not have the prestige of their 1998 counterparts but they might fly under the radar and run all the way to the title. 2004 Canterbury Bulldogs Season record: 22-6 1-12 wins: Nine 13+ wins: 13 Average winning margin: 18.14 Wins over top eight teams: 12 With the second highest number of wins over top eight teams and the fourth most wins by over 13 points, the 2004 Bulldogs are arguably the most underrated team still in the tournament. While they finished second after losing the minor premiership to the Roosters on for and against, their 22 wins is the second highest among the remaining teams."
282,"A father's exchange with a stranger about paint for his daughter's room has gone viral, grabbing the attention of social media users around the globe. The story began when Jim McCorry, a father of three from Liverpool, England, took to Facebook last week to ask for help locating a specific shade of pink paint for his daughter's bedroom. McCorry explained that he had promised his six-year-old daughter that he would paint her bedroom the ""exact shade of pink"" that she had been dreaming of. However, after weeks of searching, he had been unable to find the specific shade that she wanted. Enter Tony, a stranger who stumbled across McCorry's post and immediately offered to help. Tony, who works as a paint-mixer, offered to create the shade of pink that McCorry's daughter was looking for. Not only did Tony offer to mix the paint, but he also declined payment for his work, saying that he was happy to help bring a smile to a little girl's face. McCorry was understandably touched by Tony's kindness, and the two men quickly arranged to meet up so that Tony could mix the paint. Posting an update on Facebook after their meeting, McCorry wrote: ""He created my daughter the exact colour she wanted, and DONT GOOGLING IT MY DAUGHTER WANTS TO CALL IT 'UNICORN PINK' lol. Tony refused to accept any payment whatsoever, saying it was all for the smile on my daughters face!"" McCorry's post quickly went viral, garnering over 25,000 shares and 60,000 likes on Facebook. The story was picked up by news outlets around the globe, and social media users have been sharing heartwarming messages of support for both Jim and Tony. One user wrote: ""This is the kind of positivity we need in the world right now. It's amazing to see two strangers coming together to make a little girl's dream come true."" Another user commented: ""This is why I love the internet. People helping people, even if they're complete strangers. It doesn't get more pure than that."" McCorry's story is a testament to the power of kindness and the impact that individuals can have on the lives of others. It's also a reminder to keep an eye out for opportunities to help those around us, no matter how small the gesture may seem. As for Jim's daughter, she couldn't be happier with her new ""unicorn pink"" room. As McCorry joked in his Facebook post, ""I'm never painting again, thanks to Tony I've got a new competitor!""","Dad texted a stranger by accident about painting daughter's room blue Anonymous correspondent gave him advice on interior design Father finally decided between turquoise and periwinkle for three-year-old Their exchange has been viewed 500,000 times on Imgur Deciding a colour for a child's bedroom can be a challenge for many parents as they bicker over whether yellow is gender neutral, or if they should stick to traditional pink or blue. But one father, from the US, was in luck when a complete stranger offered him interior decorating advice after texted the wrong number by accident. And realising he had messaged someone with great taste, this dad, who hasn't been identified, continued to press for more advice about the best shade for his three-year-old's room. A father sent a frustrated message to what he thought to be his friends number explaining that the mother of his child wouldn't allow him to paint their daughter's room blue and a stranger picked up the text The exchange began after the angry dad expressed irritation that he was being told he couldn't paint his little girls' room in the hue he wanted. Hell bent on painting his little girl's room blue, he texted a friend to vent his frustration after his daughter's mother said his favoured colour wasn't right for a girl's room. The thread of texts has since been shared on Imgur by an unknown user. In initial message he writes to a companion: 'D tryna tell me I can't paint Tamiya's room blue cuz she's a girl. F*** this.' The stranger then responds: 'Wrong number but hell yeah. Paint that girl's room blue.' The recipient was happy to offer advice on decorating and encouraged the dad to paint the room blue After apologising to the recipient the dad then takes the opportunity to ask the benevolent stranger for some interior decorating tips. 'Hey can I ask a real quick? You think turquoise or that periwinkle for a 3yr old?' They respond: 'I think more a toned down turquoise. Not too loud, because bedrooms are supposed to be chill, you know?' The father then goes as far to send the receiver a colour swatch asking their opinion on the shade of blue. They remark: 'That's pretty. It could be a little dark though, depending on the size of room and furniture.' To which he responds: 'Room's okay size. There's a big window on one wall and just got her some white furniture. The kind that looks woven together.' The father seemed extremely grateful for the stranger's interior decorating advice This is a red flag to the interiors-minded stranger who asks, 'wicker?' The dad replies that it is and it's going to get dusty, but his anonymous correspondent replies, 'Probably but it's cute.' The stranger suggests a certain colour way: 'I'd do the colour you picked on the wall across from the window and maybe a lighter colour on the other three walls?' The father agrees with the suggestion adding: 'My baby girl's gonna have her blue room and it's gonna look tight as hell. 'Yo thanks for your help. Sorry for keeping you up.'

283,"The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality's (DENR) Division of Waste Management has filed a lawsuit against Duke Energy to prevent the company from permanently closing additional coal ash pits without proper state approval, according to a news release from the DENR. The lawsuit seeks to enforce the state’s Coal Ash Management Act (CAMA), which requires utilities to obtain permits to close coal ash facilities, including the construction of barrier walls to protect groundwater. Duke Energy has already closed 10 coal ash basins at six sites in the state, as part of its agreement with the state to remediate its coal ash storage.

The state agency argues Duke Energy has only so much money and time to clean out the problem sites and the company shouldn't set which get top priority."

285,"The state of Georgia is set to execute its only woman on death row, Kelly Renee Gissendaner, on Tuesday evening. Gissendaner, 46, was convicted in 1998 for her role in the murder of her husband, Douglas Gissendaner. The case has garnered national attention due to Gissendaner being one of only 52 women currently on death row in the United States. Additionally, her case has been the subject of multiple appeals and legal battles, with her execution previously being postponed twice due to various complications. However, Gissendaner's final appeal was denied by the United States Supreme Court on Monday, clearing the way for her execution to proceed. Gissendaner's lawyers had argued that her death sentence was disproportionate to her level of involvement in the crime, as well as citing concerns about the reliability of the testimony of the state's key witness. Despite these arguments, the state of Georgia has remained determined to carry out Gissendaner's sentence, with the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles also denying her request for clemency last week. Gissendaner's case has also drawn attention for her transformation in prison, with many advocates pointing to her experiences as evidence of the possibility of redemption and rehabilitation within the criminal justice system. Gissendaner has become a chaplain in prison and has gained the support of many who believe that she has made significant efforts to turn her life around. In recent months, a number of high-profile figures and organizations have come out in support of Gissendaner, including former president Jimmy Carter, the United Nations Working Group on the issue of discrimination against women, and even Pope Francis. As the clock ticks down to her execution, Gissendaner's supporters are continuing to rally in her defense, with vigils being held across the country in the hopes of raising awareness and influencing the state's decision. The controversy surrounding Gissendaner's case has once again brought the issue of the death penalty to the forefront of public debate. Despite a steady decline in the use of the death penalty across the United States in recent years, Georgia is one of a handful of states that continues to hold executions regularly. The state's commitment to capital punishment stands in contrast to growing concerns about issues such as wrongful convictions, racial disparities, and the potential for human error in carrying out such sentences. With just hours left before Gissendaner's execution, however, the focus remains on her case specifically, with many hoping that some last-minute intervention or reprieve might be possible. For Gissendaner's family and loved ones, as well as for the victim's loved ones, the case has been a long and painful one. For the state of Georgia, it marks yet another chapter in the ongoing history of capital punishment in America.","Georgia is set to execute its only woman on death row Tuesday evening. If all goes according to the state’s plan, Kelly Gissendaner will be the first woman the state has executed in 70 years. She was sentenced to death in 1998 for plotting the death of her husband, Douglas Gissendaner, with her boyfriend. Gissendaner drove her boyfriend, Gregory Owen, to her house, gave him the murder weapons — a nightstick and a hunting knife — and then went to a nightclub with friends, according to court documents. Owen ambushed Douglas and forced him to drive his car to a remote location that Gissendaner chose beforehand. Once they arrived, Owen beat Douglas and stabbed him. Owen took Douglas’s wedding ring and watch to make it look like a robbery. Gissendaner later arrived at the scene and helped her boyfriend burn her husband’s body and car. Law enforcement was unable to find Douglas’s body for weeks. Owen accepted a plea deal and testified against Gissendaner. In exchange, he received a life sentence without the possibility of parole. Gissendaner refused to take a plea and lost when she went to trial. As Gissendaner’s execution date nears, two of her and Douglas’s children are calling for her life to be spared. “We’ve lost our dad. We can’t imagine losing our mom too,” daughter Kayla Gissendaner said. youtube.com In response, Gwinnett County District Attorney Danny Porter told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that it was “manipulation.” “The case began with manipulation by Kelly Gissendaner and it appears it will end with manipulation by Kelly Gissendaner,” he said, adding that Douglas’s parents have wanted the execution to go forward. On Monday, the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles announced that it will meet on Tuesday to “receive and consider supplemental information” about the case. Previously, the board had denied clemency. The board has the option to allow the denial of clemency to stay, to grant a stay of up to 90 days, or to grant clemency. The board has the sole authority to grant clemency in Georgia. This is the third time the state has set an execution date for Gissendaner. The first time, it was called off because of the weather. The second time, it was called off after the execution drugs were found to have particles floating in them. View this image › Georgia’s pentobarbital on the date it was scheduled to be used. Georgia Department of Corrections Georgia, like some other death penalty states, obtains its execution drugs from a compounding pharmacy that mixes the drug up in secret. The state concluded that the likeliest cause was that the drugs were stored at too cold of a temperature, although its expert floated the possibility that there was a problem with how it was mixed, and the state attempted to withhold test results that disagreed with its narrative. Gissendaner’s attorneys argued that the hours she waited not knowing if the “cloudy” drugs would be used on her amounted to cruel and unusual punishment, and that it showed the state was likely to use questionable drugs on her in the future. But U.S. District Judge Thomas Thrash disagreed, finding that the state “did not intentionally subject [her] to uncertainty for the sake of inflicting more pain upon her.” “It is not enough to show that the State may obtain defective lethal injection drugs,” the judge wrote when he dismissed the case in August. Gissendaner “must show that there is a substantial risk that the defective drugs will be used on” her in the future. He added that “if anything, the March 2 incident shows that the state is unlikely to use defective drugs on” her. Gissendaner asked him to reconsider his ruling, which the judge declined to do. On Monday, Gissendaner notified the court that she was appealing the decision to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. Georgia intends to use compounded drugs again, but this time plans on storing the drugs in a new refrigeration unit to regulate its temperature. Gissendaner also has a petition at the Supreme Court seeking a stay of execution based on her claim that prison officials violated her rights by having “thwarted” the clemency process. Claiming that officials “actively frustrated the [clemency] procedures established by Georgia law,” Gissendaner’s lawyers write that such actions violated her constitutional due process rights.

288,"A shocking case of jealousy turned deadly has surfaced in a court in Bendigo, Victoria, where a poker player is accused of killing his love rival's friend. According to the court records, Mark Collins, a 35-year-old poker player, had developed feelings for a woman who was already in a relationship with another man, James Harris. Harris and Collins were said to have been friends for several years, but their relationship turned sour when Collins made his romantic intentions known. The prosecution alleges that on the evening of June 21, 2019, Collins confronted Harris about his relationship with the woman, which led to a physical altercation. Later that night, Collins approached Harris' friend, Andrew Smith, as he was leaving a nightclub and fatally assaulted him. Collins' defence counsel argues that he acted in self-defence, claiming that Smith had initiated the altercation by attacking him first. However, the prosecution counters that Collins had been looking for an opportunity to use violence against Harris and his friends. The trial, which began on Monday, has seen emotional testimony from Harris, who was present at the time of the altercation. He recounted how he and Collins had been close friends for years until he became involved with the woman who Collins was also interested in. ""Mark just couldn't accept that I was with her,"" Harris said on the stand. ""He became aggressive and confrontational, and it was obvious that he had some kind of obsession with her."" Harris also described the events of the night of Smith's death. He said that he and Smith had left the nightclub together and were walking along a quiet street when they noticed Collins approaching them. Harris claims that Collins immediately attacked Smith without provocation, punching and kicking him repeatedly until he was unconscious. The trial is expected to last several weeks, and the outcome could have far-reaching consequences for Collins. If found guilty, he could face life imprisonment. The case has also shone a light on the dangers of jealousy and obsession, and the lengths some individuals will go to protect their romantic interests. In a statement, Detective Inspector Paul O'Halloran of the Bendigo police department said: ""This case is a tragic reminder of the dangers of allowing jealousy and possessiveness to take hold. It's important that we all recognise the warning signs and seek help if we feel that we're losing control."" The community of Bendigo has been rocked by the senseless violence, and many have expressed their condolences to Smith's family and friends. The case has also sparked a wider conversation about toxic masculinity and the need for men to address their emotions in healthy ways. As the trial continues, the community will be watching closely to see what justice is served for Andrew Smith and his loved ones.","A poker player attacked and murdered the close friend of his former girlfriend's suspected lover, a court has heard. A poker player attacked and murdered the close friend of his former girlfriend's suspected lover, a court has heard. Crown prosecutor Tom Gyorffy, QC, told a Supreme Court jury on Wednesday that Collin Thomas became angry when George Anagnostellis refused to tell him where he could find his love rival. Mr Gyorffy said Mr Thomas attacked Mr Anagnostellis, who was separated from his wife and living at his parents' home in Malvern East, before setting fire to the garage on April 11, 2014. Mr Thomas has pleaded not guilty to one count of murder and one count of arson. Mr Gyorffy said that at the time of his death, Mr Anagnostellis was an avid poker player who played and organised poker tournaments at local hotels. The prosecutor described Mr Anagnostellis as a gentle man who was never violent or threatening to anyone. Mr Gyorffy said Mr Thomas and his girlfriend, Tina Thwaites, who were both poker players, had been in a relationship for about a year when Ms Thwaites ended it some time before the alleged murder. ""Mr Thomas believed that she'd been having an affair with another poker player, Mr Billy Theoharis, and he was angry about that,"" the prosecutor told the jury. ""He was trying to track him (Mr Theoharis) down and was texting and calling his phone. ""Mr Theoharis was a good friend of the deceased man (Mr Anagnostellis)."" After playing poker at the Sandown Hotel, Mr Anagnostellis invited Mr Thomas, Andrew Heke and Scott Sullivan back to his parents' Malvern East home just after 1am on April 11. The men went into the garage and sat around a table playing cards and drinking home-made ouzo and wine. By 4.30am, Mr Sullivan became unwell and left the garage in a severely intoxicated state and was later picked up by his partner. Mr Heke was asleep at the table when Mr Sullivan left. Mr Thomas then allegedly confronted Mr Anagnostellis about where he could find Mr Theoharis. Mr Thomas later told police he assaulted Mr Anagnostellis about 20 to 30 times involving ""a mixture of punches, elbows, kicks, knees, head butts"" to the face, head and body. ""It's a bit of a blur,"" Mr Thomas told police. ""I'm not really too sure about how that went down. All I remember is getting to the point where I obviously felt angry enough to assault him. ""I was just not getting anywhere and just getting sandbagged and basically being treated like an idiot, like I didn't know anything. I wasn't getting the information, obviously, that I was after and I was getting frustrated."" Mr Thomas wanted to find Mr Theoharis because there were accusations he had ""slept with my girlfriend (Ms Thwaites) at the time"" in late 2013. Mr Gyorffy said Mr Anagnostellis suffered a number of serious head and neck injuries from the beating which led to his death. ""The Crown says Mr Thomas then poured petrol on the floor and over Mr Anagnostellis' body and set it alight before he left the scene."" Defence barrister Colin Mandy told the jury Mr Thomas did not deny assaulting Mr Thomas but claimed the last time he saw him he was alive and about to set fire to himself and the garage. ""He (Mr Thomas) told the police that he dragged Andrew Heke out of there and was blown out of the door by the explosion that happened,"" Mr Mandy said. The trial, before Justice Jack Forrest, continues. The story first appeared on The Age."
289,"Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper has weighed in on the ongoing debate in Niagara Falls about whether non-residents should be allowed to vote in local elections. During a campaign stop in Niagara Falls on Tuesday, Harper said he believes in fairness and that everyone should be subject to the same rules, even if it means No. 99 can't vote. ""No one should be able to vote in an election if they don't live in the area,"" Harper told a small crowd gathered at a campaign rally. ""Everyone should be subject to the same rules. That's what fairness is all about."" Harper's comments come after a group of Canadian citizens who own property in Niagara Falls began lobbying to be included in local elections. Currently, only residents of the city are eligible to vote in municipal elections. The group, known as the ""non-resident electors committee,"" say they pay property taxes and should have a say in how the city is run. They argue that they have a vested interest in the community and should therefore have a voice in the political process. Their argument is not without precedent. In other cities, non-residents who own property are allowed to vote in municipal elections. However, Niagara Falls is one of a handful of cities in Canada that does not allow non-resident property owners to vote. Harper's comments are likely to be welcome news for residents who have been opposed to the idea of allowing non-residents to vote. Many have argued that it is unfair to allow people who do not live in the area to influence local politics. The debate over whether non-residents should be allowed to vote has been a heated one in Niagara Falls. In recent months, the issue has been raised at several city council meetings, with councillors divided on the issue. Some councillors have argued that non-residents who own property in the city should have a say in local politics, while others have said that it would be unfair to allow people who do not live in the area to vote. Despite the controversy, Harper's comments suggest that he believes in a strict interpretation of the law when it comes to who is eligible to vote in municipal elections. He said that he believes in a level playing field and that the rules should be applied equally to everyone, regardless of background. Harper's comments come as he continues his campaign to remain Canada's Prime Minister. The national election is scheduled to take place on October 21st.","TORONTO — Conservative Leader Stephen Harper did some deft skating Friday when he was told hockey legend Wayne Gretzky would be unable to vote for him Oct. 19 thanks to rules barring long-term Canadian expats from casting a ballot. Harper was unapologetic about the law, which has effectively disenfranchised about 1.4 million Canadians who have lived abroad for more than five years and sparked anger among many of them. ""Obviously, we're going to make sure that we have, I think, fair rules to make sure Canadian elections are decided by Canadian residents,"" Harper said during a campaign event in Calgary. ""I've never heard Mr. Gretzky challenge that particular notion."" Gretzky, who was raised in Brantford, Ont., but has lived for years in the United States, was slated to appear with Harper at an evening event Friday in Toronto. While Harper may not have heard from the Great One about losing his right to vote, other Canadians have been far more vocal, including actor Donald Sutherland, who denounced the law in a recent opinion piece. ""I'm an expatriate and the Harper government won't let expatriates participate in Canadian elections,"" Sutherland wrote in the Globe and Mail. Two other expats have begun a crowdfunding effort to allow them to ask the Supreme Court to take up the case after Ontario's top court upheld the law as constitutional. In a tweet Friday, Gill Frank, who helped launch the constitutional challenge, wondered why Gretzky would be campaigning for Harper if he's precluded from voting for him. Another expat, Nicolas Duchastel de Montrouge, is running against Harper in his Calgary riding to highlight what he considers absurd rules that prevent him from voting, but not from running as a candidate. Harper is effectively ""modifying"" the Constitution, Duchastel de Montrouge said. ""The Constitution doesn't have any residency requirements,"" he said. ""It says every single of citizen of Canada is entitled to vote."" Duchastel de Montrouge, now of suburban Seattle, is trying to get the required 100 signatures from residents he needs to become an official candidate — although he is discouraging people from voting for him if he does run. The first signature he got, he said, came from a fellow passenger on the flight to Calgary — a self-described Conservative. Gretzky, who recently endorsed Patrick Brown in his successful bid to lead Ontario's Progressive Conservative party, nevertheless won praise from Harper for representing more than just great hockey. ""He has been, even as an expat, a fantastic ambassador,"" Harper said, ""not just for our great national winter sport but for this country."" Besides Sutherland and Gretzky, disenfranchised expats with strong ties to Canada could include such well-known figures as Neil Young, Celine Dion, William Shatner or even Sidney Crosby, another NHL superstar who lives in the U.S. The NDP, Liberals and Greens all say they believe the expats should be able to vote.

292,"During his visit to Cuba, Pope Francis declared that the peace talks being held on the conflict between the Colombian government and the rebel group known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) must not fail. The Holy Father made the remarks as he spoke to journalists accompanying him on his plane from Rome to Havana on Friday, September 18. “Today, my thought goes to Colombia,” Pope Francis told the journalists. “Now, a dialogue is underway between the government and the FARC guerrillas, and it is important for this to succeed and for a just solution to be found to the conflict.” Pope Francis, who began his visit to Cuba on Saturday, September 19, spoke to thousands of Cubans in a Mass at the Plaza de la Revolución in Havana. In his homily, he emphasized the need for peace and reconciliation, saying, “We need to be reconciled with one another, to learn to forgive and to ask for forgiveness, to be at peace with ourselves, with our neighbor and with God.” The Colombian government and the FARC have been engaged in peace negotiations for over three years, with talks taking place in Havana, Cuba. Among the issues being discussed are land reform, drug trafficking, disarmament and the rights of victims. In his remarks to the journalists, Pope Francis expressed his hope for a successful outcome to the negotiations. “It is good that this dialogue is taking place, it is good for the country,” he said. “I hope that it is successful, for the good of the Colombian people and of the region.” The Pope’s statement comes at a crucial time in the peace talks, which have entered a delicate phase. The Colombian government and the FARC have set a November 2015 deadline for the talks to be concluded, and both sides have expressed optimism about reaching a final agreement. However, recent developments in Colombia have sparked concerns that the peace talks may fail. In August, FARC rebels attacked a military convoy, killing 11 soldiers and injuring 20 others. The attack, which took place in the southwest of the country, was one of the deadliest in recent years. Despite the challenges, Pope Francis remains hopeful that the peace talks will succeed. As his visit to Cuba comes to a close, his message of reconciliation and peace will resonate with Colombians as they continue to strive for a just and peaceful resolution to the conflict.","Pope Francis prayed for the ongoing negotiations between FARC rebels and the Colombian government happening in Cuba right now saying that “another failure” is not an option. “Please, we do not have the right to allow ourselves yet another failure on this path of peace and reconciliation,” he said following the Sept. 20 Sunday Angelus in Revolution Square. Since 1964, more than 200,000 people have been killed in Colombia’s civil war. For the past three years, Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels and the Colombian government have been engaged in peace talks in Cuba, but an outcome has not yet been reached. “At this time I feel bound to direct my thoughts to the beloved land of Colombia,” he said, “conscious of the crucial importance of the present moment when, with renewed effort and inspired by hope, its sons and daughters are seeking to build a peaceful society.” Although much innocent blood has been shed in the decades of armed conflict, he hopes that their sacrifice, united with Christ’s, may “sustain all the efforts being made, including those on this beautiful island, to achieve definitive reconciliation.” “Thus may the long night of pain and violence can, with the support of all Colombians, become an unending day of concord, justice, fraternity and love, in respect for institutions and for national and international law, so that there may be lasting peace,” the Holy Father said. Turning his attention to the example of the Blessed Mother, the pontiff urged those present to “place all our concerns and hopes before the heart of Christ.” “We pray to her in a special way for those who have lost hope and find no reasons to keep fighting, and for those who suffer from injustice, abandonment and loneliness,” he said. Like Mary, we must learn to “keep our hearts awake and attentive to the needs of others” and the “little details of life” so that no one will lack “the joy which Jesus brings us.” Pope Francis then prayed for all those experiencing difficulty, especially the Cubans whom he called the “sons and daughters” of Mary."

294,"Mumbai, India - Jackky Bhagnani, a well-known Bollywood actor, recently had the opportunity to meet his hero, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai. This dream meeting came after a mistake made by Bhagnani on social media. It all started when Bhagnani publicly commented on Yousafzai's Instagram post, expressing his admiration for her and hoping to meet her someday. Unfortunately, Bhagnani did not tag Yousafzai in his comment and it went unnoticed by her. Feeling disheartened, Bhagnani shared his mistake with his fans on Instagram, admitting that he had missed his chance to interact with his hero. However, to his surprise, Yousafzai saw his post and reached out to him. Yousafzai messaged Bhagnani, informing him that she had seen his comment and was open to meeting him. Overjoyed, Bhagnani quickly accepted her invitation and flew to London to meet her. During their meeting, Bhagnani and Yousafzai discussed a variety of topics ranging from films to activism. Bhagnani expressed his admiration for Yousafzai's dedication to girls' education and her bravery in the face of adversity. Yousafzai, on the other hand, was impressed with Bhagnani's work in the film industry and appreciated his involvement in social issues. She also encouraged Bhagnani to continue using his platform to create positive change in society. After the meeting, Bhagnani took to Instagram once again to express his gratitude for the opportunity to meet Yousafzai. He wrote, ""I never imagined that my mistake would lead me to meet my hero. Malala Yousafzai is an incredible human being, and I am so grateful for the chance to speak with her about the issues that matter to us both."" He added, ""I hope that our meeting will inspire others to never give up on their dreams, even when it seems like all hope is lost."" Yousafzai, who is known for her advocacy work for girls' education, has become a global symbol of courage and hope in the face of adversity. Her story of surviving an assassination attempt by the Taliban and her subsequent activism has inspired millions around the world. Bhagnani, who has acted in several Bollywood films and has been involved in various social causes, is known for his philanthropic work, specifically around education for underprivileged children. Their meeting serves as a reminder that even simple mistakes can lead to unexpected and positive outcomes. And, most importantly, that we all have the power to make a difference in our own way.","Mumbai: Bollywood actor Jackky Bhagnani, who made a faux pas last year when he misspelt Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai's name as 'Masala' in a tweet, got a chance to meet the Pakistani activist in London on Thursday. He considered the meeting as his “dream” and called Malala his “hero”. Jackky, who has appeared in films like “F.A.L.T.U” and “Welcome to Karachi”, earlier apologised to the 18-year-old by making a satirical six-minute video with live video entertainment platform #fame for writing her name incorrectly. The response to the video was so overwhelming that it urged Malala and her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai to invite Jackky over to meet them. The video went viral on social media a few weeks ago on the occasion of Malala’s 18th birthday on July 12. “For me things have come a full circle. From an auto-correct mistake to a birthday video tribute to a dream meeting with one of my heroes. Malala is not just an inspiration but a living example of how to fight with courage and determination,” Jackky, who left for London on Monday, said in a statement. “Her humility is touching and her sincerity is what makes her the leader that she is. Malala is a celebration of the human spirit and this meeting was an opportunity for me to experience that,” he added. Malala says Jackky's video was the “first thing” she saw on her birthday, which “made my day.” “The support encourages me to go on further as I know I'm not a lone girl in this mission of wanting girls to get quality education. I'm very thankful to Jackky and the team that made this video.” Malala said. Jackky also took to Twitter and shared a photograph of the meeting. He captioned it: “From a mistake to a dream meeting! To my hero, thank you #Malala @ZiauddinY.” Jackky further tweeted, ""No family upholds the message of #BetiBachaoBetiPadhao better than @ZiauddinY & #Malala @PMOIndia @narendramodi"" Malala Yousafzai's message to India He also shared a video message from Malala in which she can be heard saying: “Hello! Namaste and As-salamu alaykum to all my friends in India, all my brothers and sisters. I would like to say a big thank you to all of you for your kind support and encouragement to me and my campaign for education and it's your prayers and words that gives me strength to work even harder to ensure that every girl goes to school. “It's my ambition to work for that in Pakistan, in India and ensure that girls are working that hard and they will contribute to their society.

298,"In a move that is sure to raise eyebrows, the Prime Minister of India has expressed his desire to build a land bridge connecting the town of Rameswaram in India to the town of Thalaimannar in Sri Lanka. The proposed project would involve constructing a 22-kilometer-long bridge over the Palk Strait, which separates India and Sri Lanka. The idea for a land bridge has been floated before, but it has never gained much traction due to the complex geopolitical issues involved. India and Sri Lanka have a complicated relationship, with both countries laying claim to certain areas of the Palk Strait. The idea of a land bridge could potentially cause tensions between the two nations. Despite the potential roadblocks, the Prime Minister of India seems determined to make the project a reality. He believes that a land bridge would not only boost trade and tourism between the two nations but also serve as a symbol of cooperation and unity. The proposed bridge would be a massive undertaking, and it is unclear at this time how it would be funded or when construction would begin. Additionally, environmental impact studies would need to be conducted to ensure that the project would not harm the delicate ecosystem of the Palk Strait. Only time will tell whether the land bridge between Rameswaram and Thalaimannar will become a reality. But if it does, it would undoubtedly be a significant milestone in the relationship between India and Sri Lanka.","India is likely to push for an early finalisation of the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement with Sri Lanka during the September 14-16 visit of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to New Delhi. It will be the newly elected Sri Lankan PM's first visit to New Delhi, as well as his first official visit abroad after January, when he was first appointed to the post. Wickremesinghe had expressed his support for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with India only two months ago at a business forum in Colombo, asking Sri Lankan businessmen not to fear it but see it as an opportunity. The two countries have been talking about a CEPA for several years, but Sri Lankan opposition to it stalled its finalisation. India, government sources said, will now be looking to tie up the details with Wickremesinghe's ""national unity government"" and work towards finalising the agreement. Wickremesinghe has also spoken in favour of a land bridge between Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu and Thalaimannar on Sri Lanka's western coast. More than the Sethusamudram project, which has now been almost given up, the idea of a land bridge has supporters in the Modi government. The Sri Lankan PM is likely to have a lunch meeting with his counterpart Narendra Modi on September 15, aside from meetings with others in India's political leadership the same day. indianexpress.com "

301,"As tensions continue to rise around the world, it's important to remind ourselves of the need to live together in peace. While disagreements and misunderstandings may arise in our daily lives, it's critical to approach these challenges with empathy and an open mind. The world is a diverse place, filled with people of different races, religions, cultures, and backgrounds. Instead of seeing these differences as a source of conflict, we should embrace diversity as a source of strength. By working together and recognizing the value in every individual, we can foster peace and understanding. Cross-cultural communication is key to living together in peace. It's important to be respectful of different ways of life and to learn about other cultures. By doing so, we can expand our knowledge and understanding of the world, allowing us to better empathize with others. In turn, this can lead to more peaceful interactions and a greater appreciation for diversity. At the same time, we must not shy away from confronting issues that threaten to divide us. Whether it's racism, sexism, or other forms of discrimination, we must be willing to call out and address these problems. This requires a willingness to listen and learn from those affected, and a commitment to taking action to eradicate these issues. The world is facing numerous challenges that threaten our shared future. Climate change, economic inequality, and geopolitical tensions are all issues that require global cooperation to solve. By working together and recognizing our shared humanity, we can overcome these challenges and build a better world for all. One of the most effective ways to promote peace is through education. By teaching our children about the importance of diversity, empathy, and respect, we can equip them with the tools to build a more peaceful world. This involves not only formal education, but also informal learning through travel and exposure to other cultures. As responsible citizens of the world, we must also take individual actions to promote peace. This can include volunteering in our communities, advocating for social justice, and supporting ethical businesses that promote peace and sustainability. By being mindful of our actions and their impact on others, we can contribute to a more peaceful and equitable society. In conclusion, let's try to live together in peace. The journey towards a more peaceful world may not always be easy, but it's a journey worth taking. By embracing diversity, practicing empathy, and being proactive in promoting peace, we can create a world that is more just, more equitable, and more livable for all.","HOPE: A boy holds onto a fence as he waits with other migrants and refugees to register at a camp after crossing the Greek-Macedonian border near Gevgelija. PICTURE: AFP/NIKOLAY DOYCHINOV Source: AFP TWO weeks ago I wrote about compassion, and was lambasted by some readers. I expected that. My subject was refugees, and how we should be taking them in, not turning them away. On the day the piece appeared, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott bowed to public pressure, and agreed to accept a few thousand of those people fleeing from Islamic State in Syria. However, my Facebook news feed over the last week has been full of hatred and fear, both in Australia and in the UK. I’ve found out that some of my friends, especially in the UK, are racist, sharing photos and videos purporting to show that the refugees are actually members of ISIS, put there to infiltrate other countries. Other pictures show families heading to a place called “Benefits”. I’m disappointed in these friends. I thought they would show compassion. Instead they’re showing fear and hatred. Their fear is that Islam is suddenly going to take over the world. I find it sad that there’s such intolerance. ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE? John Lennon and Yoko Ono staged “love-Ins” during the 1960s, as they strived for a peaceful future. PICTURE: SUPPLIED Source: News Limited I was a child of the 1960s, and grew up with the phrase: “Make Love, Not War”. I watched as John Lennon and Yoko Ono staged “love-Ins”, and hippies in San Francisco put flowers in their hair, all in the name of world peace. I look back on those days fondly. Here’s an edited version of the sort of Facebook post I’m talking about. “Muslims who want to live under Islamic Sharia law need to get out. “We speak English as our common language not any other language. Therefore, if you wish to become part of society, learn the language and speak it. “If God or other parts of British culture offend you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your home, because God and Christian values are a major part of our culture.” As I wrote a couple of weeks ago, we’re all migrants or refugees here in Cairns. I think back to my home town in the UK, which was host to French prisoners of war in the Napoleonic wars, and then in the Second World War, Polish refugees arrived. After they proved to be no danger, the French were allowed to wander around town freely, and after the Second World War, many of the Poles stayed, making great contributions to the town’s industries and culture. NOT THE PROBLEM: Refugees should not be treated with fear and hatred. PICTURE: DAVID RAMOS/GETTY Source: When we arrived in Australia back in 1992, we came here for a better life for our children, and part of the appeal was to live in a truly multicultural society. My children have undoubtedly had a better life than they would have had in the UK. Finally, I’ve had two GPs since moving to Cairns six years ago. The first was from Iran, and my current GP is Irish. Both migrants, and on Monday I saw a different doctor, who was obviously Indian or Pakistani, yet another migrant, and I was happy to put my healthcare into his hands. I reiterate, if it wasn’t for migrants and refugees, Cairns would be a very different place than it is today. A friend works for a Catholic aid agency in town. One of their core values is: “Solidarity … everyone belongs to one human family, regardless of their national, religious, ethnic, economic, political and ideological differences.” Sounds good to me. We only live once, let’s try and live that life in peace, not war. www.christopherellis.net"
302,"In a move that has left many traditionalists stunned, a theatre company has decided to scrap the iconic dwarves from their production of Snow White. The reason? Audiences reportedly feel uncomfortable with the word. The decision was made by the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in the UK after surveys showed that some people found the term 'dwarf' offensive. In their place, the theatre will include a new character - a fluffy animal named Ronnie. The move has divided opinion, with some hailing it as a progressive step forward, while others have accused the theatre of bowing down to political correctness. Snow White and the Seven Dwarves is a beloved fairy tale, first written down by the Brothers Grimm in the 1800s. The story has since been adapted countless times for stage and screen, and the dwarves have become an integral part of the narrative. However, the theatre's artistic director Sean Foley said it was important to keep up with the times and respect the feelings of the audience. ""We're not trying to rewrite history or take anything away from the original story,"" he said. ""We're simply adapting it to make sure that everyone can enjoy it without feeling excluded or uncomfortable."" The decision has received mixed reactions on social media, with some expressing their support: ""Finally someone is doing something to make theatre more inclusive,"" wrote one Twitter user. But others called it a step too far: ""This is ridiculous. We can't erase history or change language just because some people are offended,"" tweeted another. So what lies behind this controversy? The word 'dwarf' has historically been associated with medical conditions that result in short stature, such as dwarfism. While some people with dwarfism use the term to describe themselves, others find it offensive as it can be seen as belittling or dismissive. In recent years, the term has also been co-opted by some as a slur, used to insult people who are seen as weak or insignificant. This has only added to the word's controversial status. The theatre company's decision to remove the dwarves from Snow White highlights a broader trend towards inclusivity and sensitivity in the arts world. Examples include the casting of disabled actors in TV dramas and the removal of racist language from classic plays. But some critics argue that this trend can go too far and stifle artistic expression. They point to cases where Shakespeare's plays have been censored or rewritten to remove potentially offensive language. The debate around the use of language in the arts is likely to continue for some time, with both sides making valid points. But for now, Snow White and Ronnie the fluffy animal look set to take to the stage.","De Monfort Hall in Leicester has instead renamed their Christmas production of the children's classic 'Snow White and her Seven Friends' The move will mean that characters of Bashful, Doc, Dopey, Grumpy, Happy, Sneezy and Sleepy are now going to be played by child actors Harry Potter actor Warwick Davies has branded the decision 'patronising' A theatre has come under fire after scrapping the word 'dwarf' from its Snow White pantomime - claiming the term is too offensive. De Monfort Hall in Leicester has instead renamed their Christmas production 'Snow White and her Seven Friends', claiming the audience would 'not feel comfortable' with the term 'dwarf.' It means the characters of Bashful, Doc, Dopey, Grumpy, Happy, Sneezy and Sleepy are now going to be played by child actors in the children's classic. De Monfort Hall in Leicester has instead renamed their Christmas production 'Snow White and her Seven Friends', claiming the audience would 'not feel comfortable' with the term 'dwarf' It means the characters of Bashful, Doc, Dopey, Grumpy, Happy, Sneezy and Sleepy are now going to be played by child actors in the children's classic (stock picture) Harry Potter and Star Wars actor Warwick Davies has since branded the decision 'patronising'. The 45-year-old, who set up an agency representing short actors in the UK, believes the move is financially motivated - as dwarf actors can be expensive. He said: 'Personally, I find it quite patronising when people are offended on our behalf. 'I'm sure there are those out there who don't like the term, but as a short actor I want to be given the choice about whether I appear in panto or not. 'I don't want someone making that decision for me. 'It loses something if you don't have Snow White's dwarves. I've been in a lot of pantos and I don't think it's offensive at all. 'The excuse of 'people' being uncomfortable is a poor one - I doubt they've questioned the audience about whether or not they think the word dwarf is offensive. 'I think it's all a smokescreen anyway. 'The profit margins for pantos are not very big and it's obviously much cheaper to involve schoolchildren than it is to pay lots of professional short actors.' Actor Warwick Davis and Lizzie Jay-Hughes as Snow White 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'. He has branded the decision 'patronising' A spokeswoman for the council run theatre, where the panto will run, said the word dwarf is 'generally not a word that people feel comfortable with'. But regular pantomime-goers have reacted with anger to the move. Father-of-two Mark Chapman, 27, from Coalville, said: 'How can you have Snow White and the Seven Dwarves without dwarves? It's utterly ridiculous. 'You could understand kids playing the roles at a school pantomime but not in a big theatre. It is just political correctness gone mad. 'You cannot just rebrand a children's classic at the risk of offending somebody. It is outrageous.' Darryl Birch, 34, added: 'If anything, it is more offensive to remove the term dwarf. What message does that send out? 'Even if it is cost-cutting, it is still really lame. Pantomimes are supposed to be fun and magical and this is far from it. 'I can't understand it. Their excuses are all poor and I think they ought to reconsider.' The theatre is charging £15 for an adult ticket to see the popular fairytale, written in 1812 by the Brothers Grimm and made into a feature length animation by Walt Disney in 1937. The production, which runs from December 12 to January 4 next year stars Sherrie Hewson of Benidorm fame and children's presenter Justin Fletcher. The title role of Snow White will be played by Sarah Accomando and Britain's Got Talent finalist Jon Clegg will also be appearing on stage. Willow Management, an agency representing short actors in the UK, also criticised the decision to axe the term 'dwarf' from the performance. The company, which was set up by Warwick Davis in 1995, claimed the move will 'take away the magic' from the pantomime and leave dwarf actors out of work. Co-director Peter Burroughs, 68, said: 'It is a cheap way of doing it. 'They can employ kids but that takes the living away from some of the dwarf actors so that is the great sadness here. 'It is wrong. I don't see that the term dwarf as offensive. I am a dwarf actor myself and I have never had any trouble. 'People are often overjoyed with meeting the dwarf actors at these sort of shows. 'We have never come across problems with people being uncomfortable before. 'Everybody should be relaxed at these shows. We all live perfectly well nowadays so there should be no stigma. A promotional poster for the performance at De Monfort Hall in Leicester in 1986/87 contains the word 'dwarfs' 'As one myself, I don't mind the term dwarf. 'It can take away the magic from pantomimes. People expect magic, they expect to see all sorts of things at these shows. 'I think it is a way of the theatre getting out of it, so they don't upset people.' Lucy Moore, commenting on De Montfort Hall's Facebook page, wrote: 'I am all for not offending people, but this is clearly a case of political correctness going slightly mad. 'This musical has been around for about 80 years and loved by millions - for De Montfort Hall to change the name now is utterly ridiculous, in my opinion. I can't imagine they have had a single complaint since announcing the show. It's pretty patronising.' Sue Bourton, of Leicester, also writing on Facebook, said: 'I am a parent of a child with restricted growth (or to put it plainly a Dwarf). The term Dwarf is totally fine, as is little person. The term that is derogatory is 'midget' and this should never be used. 'I was hoping that the show would use people with restricted growth to play the seven dwarves as that is how it should be, not to use children, that in itself is wrong. De Montfort Hall you have really got it wrong here, where will you draw the line? They should rethink this decision and revoke it, it's just plain silly!' Antonia Doyle wrote: 'Have a word with yourself, De Montfort Hall. By not having the seven dwarfs means that you're putting seven little men/women out if a job this year. 'Stop being a killjoy and just stick by plan A, sack the idiot who came up with this ludicrous idea and get a life rather than bringing unnecessary disappointment to the kids and making an issue out of something that isn't.' And Michelle Acton said: 'Come on De Montfort Hall, get a grip! You're just making yourselves look stupid and spoiling it for the innocent children who know and enjoy the story for what it is. Political correctness gone totally wrong - pathetic.' "
303,"West African regional bloc, ECOWAS, has announced that it will be sending a delegation to Burkina Faso, following the recent coup that led to the resignation of the country's president. The new delegation aims to negotiate a peaceful transition of power in Burkina Faso, a move that will restore stability and democracy in the country. ECOWAS is committed to upholding the principles of good governance in the region and promoting peace and security.","West African regional bloc ECOWAS on Tuesday said it was sending a new delegation of heads of state to Burkina Faso to mediate after the country's interim president was ousted in a coup.

304,"The Prime Minister of Australia, Scott Morrison, is facing a mounting backlash from some of the nation's most influential and wealthy citizens. This comes as the PM has been criticized for his handling of multiple national issues, including climate change, the economy, and the nation's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As Morrison has faced growing calls for greater action on climate change from environmental groups and some state governments, he has found himself at odds with some of the country's wealthiest business leaders. Some of these individuals, who have made their fortunes in industries such as mining and fossil fuels, have expressed their displeasure with the PM's focus on renewable energy and carbon neutrality. The PM's critics also include some of Australia's most prominent media figures, who have taken issue with his handling of press freedoms and government transparency. In recent months, Morrison has faced accusations of suppressing reports on misconduct within his government, and his government's proposed media bargaining code has drawn criticism from some of the nation's biggest news outlets. Despite these challenges, however, Morrison has remained firm in his commitment to his policies and his leadership. In a recent interview with the Brisbane Times, he defended his government's actions and criticized his detractors. ""Those who demand more from us, often have failed to deliver on their own promises,"" he said. ""I am not here to appease the select few, I am here to serve the needs of our nation and our people."" It remains to be seen how these tensions will affect Morrison's leadership going forward. Some experts have suggested that the PM may face a greater challenge in the upcoming federal election, with these wealthy and powerful individuals potentially backing opposition parties or fronting their own campaigns. Others, however, believe that Morrison will continue to maintain his position despite the pressure he faces. Political analyst Dr. Sarah Maddison argues that the PM's popularity among the general public may shield him from some of these criticisms. ""Many Australians appreciate the PM's down-to-earth persona and his emphasis on Australian values,"" she says. ""And despite the challenges he faces, he has continued to deliver on some key political promises, such as his government's response to the COVID-19 crisis."" Still, the Prime Minister's rich and powerful enemies are not to be underestimated, and they will undoubtedly continue to make their voices heard as Australia navigates the uncertain waters of a global pandemic and an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape. As the country looks ahead to the future, one thing is clear: the road ahead for the Prime Minister will be a challenging one. But if there is one thing that defines Scott Morrison's leadership style, it is his unwavering determination in the face of adversity.","Five PMs since 2010 Here we go again. My my. Another leader. Rocco Fazzari and Denis Carnahan with apologies to ABBA. PT1M14S 620 349 Every Prime Minister arrives with a history of disputes with other powerful figures, and Malcolm Turnbull has more than his fair share. Here's his top five: 1. Rupert Murdoch PM Malcolm Turnbull wants to scrap the archaic Knights and Dames system. Photo: Rob Homer Rupert Murdoch media mogul and prolific tweeter, has made no secret that he preferred Tony Abbott as leader of the Liberal Party. Murdoch's tabloids made no secret of it either. ""Malcolm Turncoat,"" said the Herald Sun , ""Smiling Assassin,"" said the Daily Telegraph after the party room spill. But the problems between Turnbull and Murdoch run deeper than a preference for Abbott's conservatism. As communications minister, Turnbull proposed an overhaul of the media ownership laws that would have permitted media companies to extend their geographic reach beyond 75 per cent and move into radio, television and newspapers. (They are currently restricted to two.) News Corp Australia opposed the changes because it does not include changes to the anti-siphoning rules, which are designed to keep important sporting programs on free-to-air television. This rule crimps the Murdoch and Telstra-owned pay TV service, Foxtel, which would no doubt use exclusive sport to lift subscriptions. Abbott parked Turnbull's media reforms and they have not seen the light of day. Will Turnbull now elevate them to a reform priority? Illustration: David Rowe. 2. Alan Jones – radio broadcaster Backtrack to June 5 last year when broadcaster Alan Jones lectured and harangued Turnbull over his loyalty on air. It was electrifying radio. It opened with Jones insisting Turnbull repeat an affirmation of loyalty to Abbott and went downhill from there. Jones: ""You have no hope ever of being the leader. You've got to get that into your head. No hope ever. But because of that you're happy to throw a few bombs around that might blow up Abbott a bit."" Turnbull : ""Well that's what you're saying. And that is what Andrew Bolt is saying. And it is doing the Labor Party's work."" Maybe time heals all wounds, but the conservative commentators – Jones especially – might have to eat a large piece of humble pie. Will Turnbull become the first leader who doesn't feel the need to tug the forelock to Jones? 3. Barnaby Joyce and the Nationals Many senior Nationals deeply dislike Turnbull over the way he acted on carbon pricing when he was opposition leader in 2009, but none more so than Barnaby Joyce. One sees himself as the smartest guy in the room; the other is a clever bush politician. It was Joyce who declared in 2009, that Turnbull ""is not my leader"", after Turnbull revealed in an interview he had been duchessed by the ALP to join them. Immediately after the ballot this week Joyce held a late-night press conference to remind Turnbull that he should take account of his party's ""key values"". Expect some sparks between Joyce and Turnbull, particularly if Joyce replaces Warren Truss as leader in the future. 4. Monarchists and conservatives The distrust of Turnbull runs particularly deep among monarchists, who are well represented among the conservative faction of the parliamentary Liberal Party. The Australian Republican Movement gave Turnbull his platform into public life. He then knocked off a leading monarchist, Peter King, who was in the way of his running for Wentworth. King later claimed in Parliament that Turnbull told him to ""f--- off and get out of my way"". Even though Turnbull has declared he's not about to reignite a debate over Australia becoming a republic, there are many who remember a brasher Turnbull, who was prepared to ridicule their stance of opposing the republic. 5. The Packer camp Australia's scariest media mogul, Kerry Packer, has shuffled off his mortal coil and Canadian media mogul Conrad Black has lost his knighthood and fortune. But back in 1991 Packer was incandescent with rage at Turnbull for derailing the Tourang bid for Fairfax. Packer was forced to pull out after diary notes put together by Packer executive Trevor Kennedy were sent to the Australian Broadcasting Authority, recording that despite assurances, Packer planned to have a big say in how Fairfax was run. This would have put him in breach of the cross-media laws. ""He told me he'd kill me, yeah,"" Turnbull said in a profile in 2009. ""I didn't think he was completely serious, but I didn't think he was entirely joking either. Look, he could be pretty scary."" We're assured that Kerry's son, James Packer, is on good terms with Turnbull these days and has even visited his home. But is this incident completely forgiven and forgotten?"
305,"Twins are born survivors A set of twins born prematurely are defying the odds and captivating the hearts of all who hear their story. Born at just 28 weeks, Lilly and Lucy have spent the past six weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. Despite the challenges that come with being born premature and the hurdles they have had to overcome, these sisters are thriving. The twins' mother, Sarah Smith, experienced a difficult pregnancy that was complicated by twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, a rare condition that affects identical twins. The syndrome is caused by abnormal blood vessels in the placenta that connect the circulatory system of the twins. In this case, it caused Lilly to receive too much blood and Lucy too little, which put them both at risk. Fortunately, Sarah's condition was closely monitored, and she was referred to a specialist team at the John Radcliffe Hospital for surgery to correct the problem. The team at the hospital were able to perform the corrective procedure, and Sarah was monitored closely for the remainder of her pregnancy. Despite the best efforts of the medical team, Lilly and Lucy were born prematurely. However, the team at the John Radcliffe Hospital was on hand to provide them with the care they needed. In the neonatal intensive care unit, the twins were given round-the-clock care, including oxygen, feeding tubes, and medications to help them grow and develop. They required specialized care, including monitoring of their vital signs and respiratory support. But as the weeks have passed, the sisters have grown stronger and stronger. They have been able to feed without assistance and are starting to breathe without oxygen. They are gaining weight and will soon be able to go home with their parents. In a statement, Sarah said: ""We are so grateful to the team at the John Radcliffe Hospital for everything they have done for our family. We could not have asked for better care for our daughters. The nurses and doctors in the neonatal intensive care unit have been incredible, and we are so thankful for everything they have done to help our twins thrive. We feel so lucky to have such strong and resilient daughters, and we are looking forward to bringing them home soon."" The story of Lilly and Lucy is a testament to the power of modern medicine and the incredible resilience of premature babies. These sisters are truly born survivors and a reminder of the miracle of life.","AN Oxfordshire mother whose twins survived premature birth has backed a national Stand Up for Tiny Lives Campaign. Gail Laing's two girls, Sophie and Emily, are now 11 years old and are leading normal and healthy lives. At the time of their birth, Mrs Laing did not know premature birth was the single biggest cause of death among babies in this country. But she is now hoping people across Oxfordshire will support a call by the charity Action Medical Research for an independent inquiry into why some babies are born so early. The campaign, backed by leading scientists and researchers, aims to get support and funding for more research into premature births. It has already raised more than £3m. Mrs Laing, a former paediatrics specialist, and her husband Michael, an officer in the RAF, live with their children in Carterton. Sophie and Emily were born at Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital, weighing just 3lb 13oz and 3lb 6oz. Mrs Laing said: ""They were whisked straight away into special care and after 10 days recovery I went home without them, which felt weird. ""My husband and I felt so very helpless. It was traumatic to see the girls in incubators with nasogastric tubes. ""We couldn't do the normal things that you do with newborn babies. ""They were too small to bath, finding clothes was a struggle and nappies were quite a hurdle too. ""I don't think anyone who hasn't experienced premature birth could imagine how terrifying it is. ""Our girls are now healthy, happy children who will soon be teenagers, but it could have been so different. We think we're extremely lucky."" After their birth, the twins caused little developmental problems for husband and wife, but that is not always the case. There are about 50,000 babies a year born too soon in the UK and the Department of Health reports a lack of understanding about how to best to predict or prevent premature birth. Prof David Field, president-elect of the British Association of Perinatal Medicine, said: ""We are currently unable to say which factors are most important in putting mums-to-be at risk of premature birth. ""This is seriously hampering our ability to develop good preventative strategies. ""We need to understand more about the process of how premature birth begins and develops. Medical research can help us in this area."" Share article Anyone wanting to know more about the issue can visit the website www.standupfortinylives.org"
306,"The Marshall Islands are experiencing the devastating impact of climate change, with rising sea levels and increasingly frequent and severe storms battering the island nation. So when Australia's Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton, made a joke about the imminent drowning of the islands, it understandably did not sit well with the Marshall Islands' Foreign Minister, John Silk. Speaking at a security forum in Brisbane, Dutton made a quip about the recent Pacific Islands Forum, saying that ""time doesn't mean anything when you're about to be, you know, have water lapping at your door."" While the comment was supposed to be a lighthearted jab at the islands' small size, it landed with a heavy thud in the Marshall Islands, which is already grappling with the very real possibility of its people becoming climate refugees. Silk, who was also in attendance at the forum, did not mince his words when he took to the podium to address the remark. ""I thought the joke was in very poor taste,"" he said. ""We've got waves that are battering our shores as we speak. Our island communities are at risk of disappearing completely. This is not a laughing matter."" The Marshall Islands has been at the forefront of the fight against climate change, with its president, Hilda Heine, being a vocal advocate for ambitious emissions reduction targets and greater climate financing for vulnerable nations. The country is also a signatory to the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Despite this, the Marshall Islands remain one of the most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change, with a particularly acute risk from sea level rise. A recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that global sea levels could rise by up to 1.1 meters by the end of this century, putting low-lying nations like the Marshall Islands at grave risk. The island nation has already witnessed the impacts of sea level rise, with its shores being eroded and its infrastructure being damaged by increasingly frequent storm surges. The government has had to spend significant resources on coastal protection measures, including the construction of seawalls and other structures, to try and mitigate the worst effects. Dutton's joke, however, seems to suggest a callousness towards the struggles of vulnerable nations like the Marshall Islands, and a dismissal of the very real threat that climate change poses. Silk's condemnation of the comment reflects the growing frustration felt by many Pacific Island leaders at the perceived lack of action from wealthier, industrialized nations like Australia. ""As Pacific islanders, we share a deep sense of responsibility for our planet and our people,"" Silk said. ""We're fighting every day to protect our homes and our way of life. We need leadership from our partners in the region to tackle this global crisis together, not jokes at our expense."" The incident highlights the urgent need for greater awareness and understanding of the impacts of climate change, particularly on vulnerable nations like the Marshall Islands. It also underscores the importance of international cooperation and solidarity in tackling this global challenge. As climate change continues to wreak havoc on vulnerable communities around the world, it is crucial that every nation takes responsibility for their role in causing the crisis and works towards a sustainable future for all. Jokes at the expense of those who are already paying the highest price should have no place in this conversation.","Marshall Islands Foreign Minister Tony de Brum has slammed Immigration Minister Peter Dutton for joking that rising seas will swamp low-lying Pacific islands, inviting him to watch waves that pound his home and terrify his grandchildren. Marshall Islands Foreign Minister Tony de Brum has slammed Immigration Minister Peter Dutton for joking that rising seas will swamp low-lying Pacific islands, inviting him to watch waves that pound his home and terrify his grandchildren. The Marshalls, a series of coral atolls and islands, is highly vulnerable to climate change and has suffered devastating storm surges and drought in recent years. On Friday Mr Dutton was that ""time doesn't mean anything when you're about to ... have water lapping at your door"", in reference to time delays during a Pacific leaders forum Mr Abbott attended this week. Mr de Brum took to Twitter to denounce Mr Dutton, saying ""insensitivity knows no bounds in the big polluting island down [south]"". ""Next time waves are battering my home [and] my grandkids are scared, I'll ask Peter Dutton to come over, and we'll see if he is still laughing,"" he wrote, adding he was ""dismayed"" by the remarks. He said the best way for Australia to ""show it cares"" is to bring a ""proper"" emissions reduction target to Paris climate talks later this year. Australia has pledged to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 per cent by 2030, based on 2005 levels. Just days ago at a meeting of Pacific leaders, despite fears that the survival of island nations was threatened. Both Mr Abbott and New Zealand Prime Minister John Key rejected pleas by smaller Pacific nations to go beyond a commitment to limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees. Some Pacific leaders have criticised Australia for prioritising economic growth over the future of their people. The leaders The Marshalls are among five island nations to join calls for a global moratorium on new coalmines – an industry Mr Abbott has described as ""good for humanity"". Mr Dutton refused to explain his remark on Friday, saying it was part of a private conversation with Mr Abbott. Mr Dutton's joke came as the leaders waited for ethnic and community groups to settle in for a meeting about Syrian refugees. The exchange was cut short when Social Services Minister Scott Morrison told Mr Abbott and Mr Dutton that a microphone was recording their conversation. Mr Abbott said on Thursday he has a ""very good story to tell"" on climate change and Pacific leaders ""should be reassured by the seriousness with which Australia is approaching this issue"". Pacific-based climate action advocates from the group 350.org have written to Mr Abbott, calling on him to apologise to Pacific nations and saying Mr Dutton should resign. ""For the Pacific, climate change is about survival. We find your government's inaction deeply disturbing and your colleague's disregard for our people deeply offensive,"" Papua New Guinea coordinator Arianne Kassman wrote. Mr de Brum has previously warned that damage from climate extremes was already lashing his nation and crippling its ability to develop. He said the Marshalls wanted to ""practise what we preach"" on halting climate change and would seek to reduce methane emissions from waste, cut diesel use and embrace more solar to meet its goals. The president of Kiribati has labelled Mr Dutton as ""morally irresponsible"" for making a ""vulgar"" joke about the rising sea levels, the ABC reports. Anote Tong said the minister should ""search his own soul"". ""What kind of a person is he? As long as there is this kind of attitude, this kind of arrogance in any position of leadership, we will continue to have a lot of tension,"" he told the ABC. ""I hope this doesn't reflect the deeper feelings ... about this issue because it's a serious issue for many people on this planet."" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald."

312,"The Black Lives Matter movement has been a prominent voice in the ongoing conversation about race and inequality in America, but its agenda may be doing more harm than good for the black community. While the movement's stated goal is to promote racial justice and push for reforms to address police brutality and other forms of discrimination, some of its actions have had unintended consequences that have disproportionately impacted black lives. For example, the movement's calls to defund police departments have led to a rise in crime in many cities, particularly in minority neighborhoods. This has put the lives of many black people at risk, as they are more likely to be victims of violent crime than any other racial group. Moreover, the movement's focus on identity politics and the idea that all white people are inherently racist has led to a polarization of America along racial lines. This has made it more difficult for us to come together as a nation to address the real systemic issues that are holding back many in our society. While it is important to acknowledge and address the racial inequalities that still exist in America, we cannot do so by demonizing entire groups of people based on their skin color. This only serves to further divide us and impede progress toward a more just and equitable society. Additionally, many of the policies and reforms that the Black Lives Matter movement advocates for, such as reparations and affirmative action, do little to address the root causes of racial inequality. Rather than promoting personal responsibility and individual achievement as means to success, these policies assume that black people are inherently disadvantaged and require special treatment to achieve success. This is simply not true. While it is undeniable that black Americans face unique challenges and barriers to success, these challenges can be overcome through hard work, education, and perseverance. By promoting a victim mentality and relying on government handouts, the Black Lives Matter movement is doing a disservice to the black community and hindering progress towards a more equal society. Furthermore, the movement's rhetoric and actions have led to a backlash among many Americans who feel that their own rights and freedoms are being threatened. This has given rise to a dangerous climate of political polarization and divisiveness, which has only served to distract from the real issues at hand. In conclusion, while the Black Lives Matter movement has brought attention to important issues of racial inequality in America, its agenda is ultimately doing more harm than good for the black community. By demonizing entire groups of people based on their skin color, promoting policies that do little to address the root causes of inequality, and contributing to a dangerous climate of political polarization, the movement is only hindering progress towards a more just and equitable society. It's time for us to come together and work towards real solutions that benefit all Americans, regardless of their race.","I ’ve seen this movie before. And for the last 25 years, I thought I’d never have to watch it again. But now it’s playing, not in theaters, but all over mainstream media, with something like rave reviews from the president and his administration. The theme of the movie is that there is an epidemic of racist white policemen, gunning down innocent black people. The movie’s message, implicit but unambiguous, is that the police must be restrained from vigorous enforcement of the law. That was the message of the Black Power movement half a century ago, and it is the message of the Black Lives Matter movement today. Consider the BLM demands. Some are anodyne. Who is against “better training for police officers”? We already have independent (usually elected) prosecutors. The law already “limit(s) the use of force by police.” But the most important BLM demand is the first: “End ‘broken windows’ policing.” The evidence is that this is already happening — at the cost of black lives. Even the New York Times has noticed. So far this year, murders are up 76 percent in Milwaukee, 60 percent in St. Louis, 56 percent in Baltimore, and 44 percent in Washington, D.C. While murders are up, arrests are down. There is, as Manhattan Institute scholar Heather Mac Donald writes, a “reluctance to act [that] is affecting police departments across the country, as virtually every tool in an officer’s tool chest — from traffic stops to public-order maintenance — is vilified as racist.” The message of the Black Power movement half a century ago . . . is the message of the Black Lives Matter movement today. In Baltimore, the death of Freddie Gray after slipping into a coma in a police van in April inspired mass protests and apparently prompted police to abandon active patrolling; arrests suddenly plunged 60 percent below 2014 rates. There were 58 murders in Baltimore up to April 15 this year, up from 49. From April 16 to August 23, there were 157 murders in the city, up from 88 in 2014, with 45 murders in July alone. Almost all of the victims were black. Those insisting that “black lives matter” — and shouting down politicians such as former Baltimore Mayor Martin O’Malley for saying “all lives matter” — are apparently unfazed by this shocking increase in black deaths. Some BLM activists go farther, calling for murder of police. Some wear shirts with the words “Assata taught me” — a reference to the woman, now a fugitive in Cuba, convicted in 1977 of murdering a New Jersey state trooper. BLM activists marching outside the Minnesota State Fair chanted, “Pigs in a blanket. Fry ’em like bacon.” That was a day after the Democratic National Committee, meeting in Minneapolis, approved a resolution “condemning extrajudicial killings and affirming black lives matter” and hailing “a generation of young African-Americans who feel totally dismissed and unheard as they are crushed between unlawful street violence and unjust police violence.” “We need to start killing these officers,” shouted a crowd as police arrested a violent woman in Madison, Wisconsin — an ultraliberal university town where, incidentally, blacks are arrested at ten times the rate of whites. Across the country some people seem to be acting on that advice. Last December, after the protests of the death in custody of a man on Staten Island, two New York Police Department officers were shot and killed in Brooklyn. On August 2, a policeman was killed during a routine traffic stop in Memphis. On August 29, a sheriff’s deputy was gunned down in Houston. On August 31, a police officer was killed in Fox Lake, Illinois. No wonder a Rasmussen poll conducted on August 31 and September 1 found that 58 percent of Americans think there is a “war on police” today. This violence has evoked little response from Barack Obama, who weighed in unnecessarily on the arrest of scholar Henry Louis Gates in July 2009 and the death of Trayvon Martin in March 2012. In August 2014 he said that the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri — after he robbed a convenience store and charged a policeman — “awakened our nation” to a reality blacks already understood, all of which sounds like the BLM narrative. The tragedy is that the “broken windows” policing BLM decries has saved thousands of black lives. From 1990 to 2014, murders declined from 2,262 to 333 in New York, from 987 to 251 in Los Angeles, from 943 to 413 in Chicago. Now they’re up again. I’ve seen that movie before, when violent crime tripled between 1965 and 1975. I hope its ends differently this time. — Michael Barone is senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner . © 2015 the Washington Examiner. Distributed by Creators.com"
313,"In a devastating series of wildfires that have been raging across Northern California for the past several days, nearly 1,600 homes have been destroyed, rendering thousands of people homeless. The fires have caused widespread destruction and have left many communities in a state of shock and despair. The most devastating of the wildfires, the Caldor Fire, has been burning since August 14 and has already consumed over 200,000 acres of land. The fire started in the El Dorado National Forest and has since spread to two other counties, causing widespread damage along the way. The Caldor Fire alone has destroyed over 1,000 homes in the region, leaving many families with nowhere to go. Thousands of residents have been forced to flee their homes, and many have lost everything they own. These families are now in emergency shelters, waiting for some respite and a chance to start rebuilding their lives. While the Caldor Fire has been the most destructive of the wildfires, several other fires are also raging across Northern California, including the Dixie Fire, which has been burning since July and is now the second-largest wildfire in the state's history. In total, over 13,000 firefighters are battling to contain the blazes, which have been fueled by hot, dry weather and high winds. The fires have also been exacerbated by years of drought, which has left California's forests tinder-dry and highly flammable. Despite the tireless efforts of firefighters, the wildfires continue to spread, and authorities are warning that the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better. More strong winds and hot, dry weather are forecast in the coming days, which could fan the flames and cause the fires to spread even further. As the fires continue to rage, California Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency and has called on the federal government to provide assistance. President Biden has approved a major disaster declaration for California, which will release federal funds to help with the recovery effort. For the people of Northern California, however, the road to recovery will be a long and difficult one. For those who have lost their homes, the task of rebuilding their lives will be daunting. For those who have been forced to evacuate, the days and weeks ahead will be filled with uncertainty. In the face of this tragedy, however, the people of Northern California have shown remarkable resilience and determination. Despite the devastation they have faced, they remain determined to rebuild their communities and to come back stronger than ever before.","Created: 09/20/2015 11:53 PM By: MIDDLETOWN, Calif. (AP) — California fire officials said a wildfire north of San Francisco destroyed another 162 homes, raising the number of homes destroyed to 1,050 and making it the third worst wildfire in the state's history. The tally announced on Sunday brought the total number of homes destroyed in two wildfires burning in Northern California to nearly 1,600, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. Those fires killed five people, and on Sunday authorities announced that a body was found in the ashes of a wildfire in Monterey County that destroyed or damaged 10 homes. Firefighters found the man's body inside a charred vehicle after the fire began Saturday near the community of Jamesburg. Investigators were investigating his death as a possible suicide, Monterey County Sheriff's spokesman John Thornburg said. A firefighter lost his home while battling the blaze, the Santa Cruz Sentinel reported. ""I was out fighting the fire on the other end, and then my whole place burned down,"" Bob Eaton, a volunteer firefighter with the Cachagua Fire Protection District, told the newspaper. ""My parent's house, right below me, it burned down. And my neighbors up on top, their place is burned down."" Eaton said firefighters' quick response to the blaze wasn't enough to save some of the homes. ""It just went so damn fast,"" he said of the spread of the fire. The blaze was one of 10 active wildfires Sunday, most of them in Northern California that continue to threaten thousand more homes. Damage-assessment teams have counted 1,050 homes burned in Lake County, many of them in the town of Middletown, CalFire spokesman Daniel Berlant said. The teams have completed about 80 percent of damage assessment, focusing largely on homes, Berlant said. They have not determined how many additional structures, such as sheds, barns and other outbuildings, were destroyed. The fire, which killed at least three people and charred 118 square miles was 69 percent contained. About 6,500 homes remained threatened by the fire, considered the third worst fire in California history based on total structures burned. A 1991 fire in the Oakland Hills ranks as California's deadliest fire and its worst in the number of homes destroyed. Meanwhile, another 545 homes were destroyed by a separate blaze that killed at least two people and that has burned 110 square miles in the Sierra Nevada foothills. That blaze was 72 percent contained Sunday. Even though it continued to threaten thousands of structures, all evacuation orders were lifted. ("

315,"The Ball State Cardinals showed promising signs of a successful season opener on Saturday, with strong offensive and defensive performances against Western Illinois. However, turnovers and mistakes ultimately led to a disappointing result for the Cardinals, who fell short in a 24-10 loss at Scheumann Stadium. Ball State quarterback Drew Plitt had a solid outing, completing 21 of 35 passes for 208 yards and a touchdown. Wide receiver Yo’Heinz Tyler also had a strong showing, catching four passes for 72 yards and a touchdown. Defensively, the Cardinals were able to limit Western Illinois to just 240 yards of total offense and kept them scoreless in the second half. The linebacker corps was particularly impressive, with Christian Albright leading the team with 11 total tackles and Bryce Cosby adding eight tackles and a fumble recovery. However, Ball State’s performance was marred by costly mistakes and turnovers. The team committed three turnovers, including two interceptions thrown by Plitt. Additionally, the Cardinals committed nine penalties for a total of 80 yards. “We just had too many mistakes today,” said head coach Mike Neu after the game. “We can’t turn the ball over like we did and expect to win. We had too many penalties that killed drives and gave them good field position.” One of the most costly mistakes came in the second quarter when Plitt threw an interception in the end zone, preventing the Cardinals from potentially tying the game at 14. The defense was able to hold Western Illinois to a field goal, but the missed opportunity proved to be a turning point in the game. The Cardinals also struggled in the red zone, failing to capitalize on several opportunities to score touchdowns. They had to settle for a field goal on their first trip inside Western Illinois’ 20-yard line, and later in the game, Plitt was sacked on fourth down at the 18-yard line, turning the ball over on downs. Despite the disappointing result, there were still positives to take away from the game for the Cardinals. Neu praised the team’s effort and intensity, and highlighted the strong defensive performance in the second half. “We have a lot to build on,” Neu said. “Our guys fought hard until the end, and we’re going to learn from our mistakes and come back stronger next week.” The Cardinals will look to bounce back next week when they take on Wyoming on the road. They will need to clean up their mistakes and turnovers if they hope to come away with a victory against a tough opponent. Overall, the season opener was a mixed bag for Ball State. There were glimpses of a strong, competitive team, but ultimately, mistakes and turnovers prevented them from reaching their full potential. Nonetheless, the Cardinals have plenty of time to improve and show what they’re capable of this season.","The Daily News | Chase Akins Published 49 minutes ago Updated 47 minutes ago Ball State gained 181 yards on the ground against Northwestern on Sept. 26, led by Riley Neal, Darian Green and James Gilbert. The Wildcats had only allowed 110 yards per game before playing the Cardinals. DN PHOTO ALLISON COFFIN On the surface, Ball State's 24-19 loss at No. 17 Northwestern doesn't seem like a bad one based on the Wildcats' prowess. Northwestern was a clear favorite in the game, and many people probably picked Ball State to get blown out. Ball State controlled most of the game, however, and either tied or outscored Northwestern in three quarters on Sept. 26. Missed chances and the Wildcats' big third quarter doomed the Cardinals in the loss. “Again, not a bad effort by any means,"" head coach Pete Lembo said. ""But one where we needed to make a few more plays in six or seven different situations."" After taking an early 3-0 lead against the nation's No. 10-ranked defense coming in, Ball State got the ball back after a turnover on downs. They pushed the ball down the field, but freshman Morgan Hagee missed a 43-yard field goal. Hagee missed two field goals in the game, finishing 2-of-4. Just a few drives later, the Cardinals were knocking on the door again. A 34-yard James Gilbert run took the ball to the 4-yard line to end the first quarter. But quarterback Riley Neal, in the first start of his career, fumbled the snap while attempting to hand it off, and the Wildcats recovered Another chance to extend the lead, another costly mistake. Neal agreed with Lembo that it may have been the difference in the game. “If I [didn't] fumble that ball on the 5-yard line, we’d have more points on the board,” Neal said. “We left plenty of points on the field where it should have been a different ball game.” Ball State's defense stood up to Northwestern by forcing four turnovers. They gave up a big touchdown in the second quarter and 17 points in the third, but gave the offense good chances to put points on the board. The Wildcats had turned the ball over just three times coming into the game. “Our defense played well enough that if were able to get those 14 points, [we'd be] a little bit happier right now — a lot happier right now,” Lembo said. Still, after the Wildcats' big third quarter, the Cardinals had their chances. They put together one touchdown drive in the second half, but failed to take advantage of short field on a few occasions. While there were positives — Ball State fared better offensively against Northwestern than Stanford or Duke — the combination of mistakes added up in defeat. Lembo knows this was a game that his team had every opportunity to win, but couldn't pull through. The Cardinals (2-2, 1-0) can take the positives from this game, however, and carry them into the rest of their Mid-American Conference schedule. Ball State will face another tough test next week against Toledo, who sits right outside the top 25 after a 3-0 start with wins against Arkansas and Iowa State."
316,"A US court has ruled that Samsung cannot sell old phone models in the US as part of an ongoing legal battle with Apple. The ruling came from a federal court in California and specifically blocks the sale of the Galaxy SII, Galaxy SIII, and Galaxy Note smartphones. This is the latest episode in a long-running patent dispute between the two tech giants, which began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung for violating its patents. The case has resulted in numerous legal battles around the world, with both companies accusing each other of patent infringement. In this particular case, which was filed in 2012, Apple accused Samsung of copying designs for the iPhone. The company argued that Samsung had infringed on five separate patents, including the ""bounce back"" feature when a user scrolls to the bottom of a page. The court found that Samsung had indeed infringed on two of the patents and ordered it to pay $119.6 million in damages to Apple. However, it also ruled that Samsung could continue to sell newer phone models that did not infringe on Apple's patents. Samsung has not commented on the ruling, but a spokesperson for Apple said, ""We are pleased with the court’s decision."" It is unclear how much impact the ruling will have on Samsung's business in the US. While the Galaxy SII and SIII are several years old and no longer sold directly by Samsung, they are still available from some retailers and online marketplaces. The Galaxy Note, which was released in 2012 and also targeted by the ruling, is still sold by Samsung as a refurbished device. This is not the first time that Samsung has been ordered to pay damages to Apple in this ongoing legal saga. In 2018, a US court ordered Samsung to pay $539 million in damages for violating Apple's patents related to the iPhone's design. The ruling is just the latest example of the continuing legal battles between tech giants over patent infringement. While the legal system can provide recourse for companies that feel their intellectual property rights have been violated, the long and complicated legal battles that often ensue can be costly and time-consuming for all involved.","WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court is blocking Samsung Electronics from selling some of its older smartphones in the U.S. in the latest twist to a long-running legal battle over how much of the devices' technology was copied from Apple's iPhone. The ruling issued Thursday by the U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington vindicates Apple, but might not hurt Samsung too much. That's because it applies to phones that are no longer popular. The most recent phone affected by the injunction, the Galaxy S3, was released in 2012 — long enough ago to be eclipsed by slicker smartphones in the rapidly evolving market for mobile technology. Samsung recently began selling the Galaxy S6, which was unaffected by Thursday's decision. Samsung could also revise the features covered by the injunction, something that the company has previously indicated it might do if prodded by the courts. Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. have been locked in a bitter feud for years over the patents covering a variety of features commonly used in many smartphones. The acrimony dates back to the reign of Apple's late CEO Steve Jobs, who contended that Google had ripped off the iPhone's innovations to use in Android, a free mobile operating system that Samsung uses in its smartphones. Samsung emerged as Apple's biggest rival in the smartphone market, making it the target of a legal onslaught that has continued long after Jobs' death nearly four years ago. Juries in two separate federal court trials in San Jose, California, decided some of the features in Samsung's phones and tablets infringed on Apple's patents covering iPhone innovations. Apple has been awarded more than $600 million in damages so far, but Samsung is still pursuing appeals that could reduce the amount owed. In a 2-1 vote, the appeals court issuing Thursday's injunction concluded Apple was being harmed by Samsung's infringement on patents for iPhone's slide-to-lock screen and auto-correct feature. The court also concluded that protecting Apple's intellectual rights wouldn't harm the public welfare. ""Apple does not seek to enjoin the sale of lifesaving drugs, but to prevent Samsung from profiting from the unauthorized use of infringing features in its cellphones and tablets,"" wrote U.S. Federal Circuit Judge Kimberly Moore in the majority opinion."
317,"Russian driver Daniil Kvyat of Toro Rosso claimed the top spot in second practice sessions at a rain-hit Suzuka Circuit on Friday afternoon in preparation for the Japanese Grand Prix. Kvyat who was dropped by the senior Red Bull team in 2017, clocked 1 minute 27.896 seconds, which put him 0.088 seconds ahead of Charles Leclerc of Ferrari, who was second fastest. Lewis Hamilton, who had topped the time sheets in the morning session, managed a 1:28.735, but was still 0.839s adrift of Kvyat in third position, with teammate Valtteri Bottas at fourth. The afternoon session was hit by heavy rain affecting the practice of some teams. However, Kvyat managed to put up a good performance with his Toro Rosso car, as he led the session despite the difficult conditions. Kvyat's pace in wet conditions will no doubt serve as a boost to the Toro Rosso team as the weather forecast shows possible wet conditions for the race weekend. ""It was raining hard and Suzuka is always a big challenge, but we did our job and managed a good lap,"" said Kvyat in an interview with Sky Sports News. Leclerc who was on provisional pole at the Russian Grand Prix earlier this month, was just a fraction behind Kvyat in second place. The young driver is looking confident ahead of the weekend's activities, noting that the pace was good and his feelings in the car were positive. Meanwhile, Red Bull's Max Verstappen had a difficult session, finishing at sixth place, with Carlos Sainz Jnr of McLaren and Alexander Albon of Red Bull Racing finishing at seventh and eighth respectively. The earlier practice session was littered with red flags as drivers struggled with the wet conditions. Despite the difficult conditions, Hamilton managed to top the timesheet with team-mate Bottas at second place. The weather conditions in Suzuka remain unpredictable and it seems likely that they will pose a big challenge to the drivers throughout the weekend. Nevertheless, Daniil Kvyat has given a strong indication of his ability to manage the challenging conditions and this ability may prove precious when the race day arrives.","Red Bull driver Daniil Kvyat was fastest in second practice for the Japanese Grand Prix as heavy rain played havoc in both sessions on Friday. The Russian, who completed just six laps, posted a best time of one minute and 48.277 seconds to head the Mercedes pair of Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton in the order. Earlier on Friday, Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz finished on top of the timesheets for the first time in his grand prix career, with only 12 of the 20 drivers bothering to post a time in the rain. The sport of Formula One is back in Suzuka for the first time since Frenchman Jules Bianchi's fatal crash. And the miserable conditions here on Friday were eerily similar to those which saw Bianchi skid off the track and hit the side of a crane deployed to recover Adrian Sutil's stricken Sauber in last year's tragic race. Bianchi never regained conciousness and died nine months later on July 17. On Friday, the rain had been expected to ease throughout the day, but persistent showers were detrimental to both sessions. Sebastian Vettel, winner last time out in Singapore, was among a host of drivers to fall foul of the slippery conditions after he ran off the track at turn one. His Ferrari team-mate, Kimi Raikkonen, and Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, who was fourth, also endured hairy moments. The forecast is for dry running for the remainder of the weekend making Friday's times, in front of the fanatical Japanese fans, largely irrelevant. Hamilton will head into Sundays' race with a 41-point margin over Rosberg. Vettel, fifth fastest in practice, is eight points further back. Jenson Button, whose Formula one future remains shrouded in mystery, was 12th, 3.5 seconds slower than Kvyat while his McLaren team-mate Fernando Alonso, who spent much of the second session as a bystander, only 17th.

For the second consecutive day members of the cash-strapped outfit, who are due in the High Court on Monday over an unpaid tax bill, have seeked refuge elsewhere with the drivers forced to dine with rival teams in the paddock."

319,"Broadway's hit show ""Beautiful: The Carole King Musical"" is hitting the road once again, but this time with a special sibling twist. The national tour, which launched on September 15th at the Providence Performing Arts Center, will now feature two real-life sisters in leading roles. The show follows the early life and career of award-winning singer-songwriter Carole King, featuring classic hits such as ""Natural Woman"", ""So Far Away"", and ""I Feel the Earth Move"". First premiering on Broadway in 2014, the musical has since gone on to win two Tony Awards and a Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album. For the national tour, Abby Mueller is reprising her role as Carole King. Mueller originally played the part on Broadway in 2015, earning a Tony nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role in a Musical. However, this time around she will be joined on stage by her real-life sister, Becky Gulsvig, who will be playing the role of King's best friend and songwriting partner, Cynthia Weil. Gulsvig, best known for her role in the national tour of ""Legally Blonde"", says working with her sister has been a dream come true. ""We've always wanted to work together, but it's never worked out until now"", she said in a recent interview. ""To have the opportunity to do what we love together and tour the country while doing it is just amazing."" The sisters' connection even extends to the show itself, with King and Weil's iconic partnership serving as a reflection of their own sibling bond. Mueller explained, ""Carole and Cynthia had this incredible friendship and working relationship. It's a powerful thing to see two women who rely on each other so much to create something beautiful. And to be able to play that alongside my own sister is incredibly special."" The show's producer, Paul Blake, agrees that the sibling connection brings something unique to the production. ""We're thrilled to have Abby and Becky on board for this tour"", he said. ""Their chemistry on stage is undeniable, and it adds a new layer of authenticity to the story we're telling."" Fans of the musical can expect the same show-stopping numbers and heartwarming storylines they fell in love with on Broadway, but with some new surprises thrown into the mix. ""Beautiful"" is expected to tour over 25 cities in the US, including Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, before wrapping up in July 2022. Judging by the show's past success and the excitement surrounding the national tour, it's safe to say that ""Beautiful"" will continue to captivate audiences for years to come. King's timeless music and the show's celebration of female friendship and creativity make it a must-see for fans of Broadway and music alike. As for Abby and Becky, they're eagerly anticipating the journey ahead. ""To be able to travel the country and bring something so special to audiences all over is such an honor"", Abby said. ""And to do it with my sister by my side? It's a dream come true.""","NEW YORK -- Theatergoers who check out ""Beautiful"" on tour won't get to see Tony winner Jessie Mueller but they may get the next best thing -- someone with her DNA. Mueller's older sister Abby has stepped into her sister's shoes to play Carole King in the Broadway musical about the celebrated ""I Feel the Earth Move"" songwriter. Abby Mueller acknowledged she was ""a little hesitant"" to audition for a part that earned her sister a best-actress Tony Award last year. ""I'm really glad my agent convinced me to and I'm really glad they saw something in me. I've just been having the best time doing this,"" said Abby Mueller. ""As soon as I got the audition, I called Jessie. I was like, 'I've got a funny story for you.'"" Jessie and Abby Mueller are just the tip of the talented, Chicago-based Mueller family. Their brothers, Matt and Andrew, as well as their parents, Roger Mueller and Jill Shellabarger, are all actors. ""Beautiful"" director Marc Bruni said Abby, who graduated from Indiana University and has been on Broadway in ""Kinky Boots,"" earned the job with her skills. ""We did not set out to specifically cast within the Mueller family. Abby is an extraordinary talent in her own right,"" he said. ""She is creating her own version of Carole that has all of the emotional resonance and all of the truthful acting that comes with the Mueller family and their amazing accessibility of emotion."" The tour kicks off in Providence, Rhode Island, on Tuesday. It makes stops in North Carolina, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Illinois, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Florida, Georgia, Texas, California and Colorado. One of the tour's highlights for Mueller will be spending the holidays and New Year's Eve in Chicago. ""It's going to be awesome. I'm thrilled,"" she said. ""I haven't been home for Christmas in years."" The musical tells the story of King and her first husband, Gerry Goffin, who together composed some of the greatest pop singles of the early 1960s, including The Shirelles' ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow,"" the Drifters' ""Up on the Roof,"" Bobby Vee's ""Take Good Care of My Baby"" and Little Eva's ""The Loco-Motion."" Book writer Douglas McGrath intertwines the story of King and Goffin with that of their friends and avid competitors, the songwriting team of Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, which opens another treasure trove of pop hits like ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'"" and ""Walking in the Rain."" Audience members get some history -- and some killer tunes. ""You learn something and you have your heart warmed. And you also have this catalog of music that is just unparalleled,"" said Bruni. It will be the first time on the road for Mueller, but not for Liam Tobin, who plays Gerry Goffin. The Canadian-born Tobin toured western Europe in ""West Side Story."" He didn't see the Broadway version until after starting tour rehearsals and said he loves digging into a character who struggles with mental illness and guilt. ""It's been a real treat to go somewhere else with a character than just your classic leading man,"" he said. ""It's really a privilege to really dig in to something like Gerry."" Mueller, who grew up listening to King's landmark album ""Tapestry"" and recently met the songwriter, has been trying to tap into King's honesty and vulnerability. ""Trying to do anything to be like Carole is instantly going to ring false,"" she said. ""Hopefully, when you're going for that truth and honesty, those are the essence that made people love Carole and hopefully that essence is what's going to carry the show."" ___ Online: http://beautifulonbroadway.com/tour ___ Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwitsOnline"

321,"In a surprise move, Exelon Corporation has announced that it will defer decisions on the future of its Quad Cities and Byron nuclear plants for one year. The decision comes after months of speculation about the future of the power plants, which have been struggling financially amid a challenging energy marketplace. Exelon's decision to defer a judgment on the fates of the plants has been met with a mix of relief and uncertainty by stakeholders. While supporters of the nuclear industry are pleased that the plants will remain open for at least another year, others worry that the postponement of action could lead to the eventual closure of the facilities. According to Valerie Jarrett, Exelon's Senior Advisor and Chair of the Nuclear Oversight Committee, the decision to defer a decision on the plants was made after extensive consultations with stakeholders and regulators. ""Exelon remains committed to the nuclear industry and to the communities in which our plants operate,"" Jarrett said in a statement. ""However, we recognize that there are many factors that need to be considered when making a decision of this magnitude, and we want to ensure that we have all of the information and feedback necessary to make the best possible decision."" The Quad Cities and Byron nuclear plants have been facing financial challenges for several years, thanks in part to low natural gas prices and increasing production from wind and solar energy sources. While Exelon has taken steps to reduce costs and increase efficiency at the plants, the company has warned that continued challenges could lead to the closure of one or both facilities. Exelon's announcement to defer a decision on the future of the plants comes after a series of public hearings and consultations with stakeholders. At these meetings, community members and leaders expressed concerns about the potential loss of jobs and tax revenue that could result from the closure of the plants. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker also weighed in on the issue, stating that he was ""committed to working with Exelon and other stakeholders to find a solution that ensures the safe and efficient operation of these important energy assets."" The decision to defer a decision on the Quad Cities and Byron plants comes at a time of uncertainty for the U.S. nuclear industry as a whole. While nuclear power has long been seen as a reliable, carbon-free source of energy, many plants across the country have struggled to remain financially viable. Exelon, which operates more nuclear plants than any other company in the United States, has been working to address these challenges through increased efficiency, cost-cutting measures, and advocacy for policies that support the industry. ""I am optimistic about the future of the nuclear industry,"" Jarrett said. ""While there are certainly challenges ahead, I believe that nuclear power has an important role to play in our energy mix for years to come."" As Exelon continues to evaluate the future of its Quad Cities and Byron plants over the next year, the company and its stakeholders will undoubtedly be watching closely to see how the market and energy landscape evolves. For now, however, the plants will remain operational and a critical part of the Illinois energy infrastructure.","Deferral follows outcome of third PJM capacity auction CHICAGO--(EON: Enhanced Online News “While Quad Cities and Byron remain economically challenged, we are encouraged by the results of the recent capacity auctions. The new market reforms help to recognize the unique value of always-on nuclear power, while preserving the reliability of our electric system” Exelon intends to bid Quad Cities, Byron, Three Mile Island and all eligible nuclear plants into the 2019-2020 PJM capacity auction next year. The decision to defer retirement decisions comes after rigorous analysis of the present and future economics of the plants, taking into consideration the constructive market trends stemming from the PJM capacity auction reforms. “While Quad Cities and Byron remain economically challenged, we are encouraged by the results of the recent capacity auctions. The new market reforms help to recognize the unique value of always-on nuclear power, while preserving the reliability of our electric system,” said Chris Crane, Exelon president and CEO. “However, these plants are long-lived assets with decades of useful life left, and today’s decision is only a short-term reprieve. Policy reforms are still needed to level the playing field for all forms of clean energy and best position the state of Illinois to meet EPA’s new carbon reduction rules.” Exelon will continue its dialogue with Illinois policymakers about market and policy reforms that properly value nuclear power for the economic and environmental benefits it provides. Exelon has long supported efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector and has invested in clean technologies to improve the quality of the air for the benefit of its customers. The EPA’s Clean Power Plan, which mandates significant reductions in carbon emissions from power plants, will require the states and the power sector to find the most cost-effective solutions to achieve the required reductions. The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency determined that the loss of two nuclear plants would increase emissions by about 24 million short tons, more than doubling the emissions reductions required under the EPA’s carbon reduction rules and making it twice as costly to comply. The Illinois EPA calculated the incremental societal cost of losing two plants at more than $10 billion -- a figure that does not include the additional billions of dollars early retirements would cost in the form of higher energy bills, reduced electric reliability and lost jobs. The auction results for the 2017-18 planning year take effect in June 2017. The transition auction was the second of two held by PJM to supplement its prior base capacity auctions for the 2016-17 and 2017-18 planning years with the new capacity performance product, which is designed to strengthen electric grid reliability. Unlike Quad Cities and Byron, Exelon’s Clinton nuclear plant operates in MISO territory and did not benefit from the PJM auction results. While a MISO capacity auction held earlier this year helped reduce Clinton’s economic losses, the plant remains economically challenged and is at risk of premature retirement if conditions do not improve. Grid operator PJM holds a capacity auction annually to ensure enough power generation resources are available to meet demand in its region covering all or part of 13 states and the District of Columbia. Although capacity revenue in a single year is an important consideration in a plant’s long-term viability, it is just one of several factors Exelon uses to make decisions about its plants’ future operations. Exelon Corporation (NYSE: EXC) is the nation’s leading competitive energy provider, with 2014 revenues of approximately $27.4 billion. Headquartered in Chicago, Exelon does business in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Canada.

322,"The University of Arkansas at Little Rock Bisons are struggling to find their footing on the basketball court this season due to their disappointing offensive performance. Through their first ten games, the Bisons have posted an underwhelming record of 4-6, failing to meet the expectations of fans and coaches alike. The team’s offensive struggles have been a major contributor to their disappointing start, as they have averaged just 63.2 points per game, ranking them 335th out of 357 Division I basketball programs. Despite being the team’s leading scorer, senior guard Charles Nwachukwu has failed to carry the Bisons’ offense on his shoulders this season. Nwachukwu has averaged 13.6 points per game so far, but has been plagued by poor shooting, hitting just 37.9% of his field goal attempts and 29.3% of his three-point attempts. “We’ve got to get better shots and we’ve got to take care of the ball better,” Nwachukwu said. “That’s the biggest thing. We’ve got to find ways to get our shots up and take better shots.” The Bisons have had their share of offensive struggles in recent years, but this season has been particularly challenging. Head coach Darrell Walker has tried a variety of different lineups and offensive strategies to jumpstart the team’s scoring output, but has yet to find a consistent solution. “I’m just trying to find the right blend of guys that can score the basketball and play defense at the same time,” Walker said. “It’s just a matter of guys being confident in their game and trusting each other.” One player who has stepped up for the Bisons this season is sophomore guard Nikola Stojiljkovic. Stojiljkovic has emerged as a reliable scoring option off the bench, averaging 10.1 points per game while shooting 41.5% from the field and 40.7% from beyond the arc. “Nikola’s been great for us,” Walker said. “He’s a guy that can really shoot the ball and he’s got a lot of confidence in himself. We need more guys like him to step up and contribute.” Another issue for the Bisons this season has been their inability to close out close games. Of their six losses, five have come by seven points or fewer, including several games where they held leads late in the game. “We’ve got to learn how to finish games,” Nwachukwu said. “We’ve got to play with urgency and intensity for the full 40 minutes. We can’t get complacent and let teams back into the game.” Despite their struggles, the Bisons remain confident in their ability to turn things around and find success this season. They believe that their strong defense, which ranks 102nd in the nation allowing just 66.5 points per game, will keep them in games and give them a chance to win. “We’re not giving up,” Stojiljkovic said. “We’ve got a lot of games left and we know we can play better. We just have to keep working hard and stay positive.” The Bisons will have a chance to get back on track when they return to action on January 2nd against the University of Louisiana Monroe. With conference play looming, the time is now for the Bisons to start putting things together and make a push for a postseason berth.","SEARCY -- Ronnie Huckeba is entering his 30th season as a football coach at his alma mater. One of the biggest signs of progress has come in recent years, when at times he'll be stopped by friends or even strangers asking some form of the same question. At a glance HARDING MASCOT Bisons COACH Ronnie Huckeba (50-36 in eight seasons at Harding and overall) LAST SEASON 9-2 overall, 8-2 in the Great American Conference OFFENSIVE PLAYER TO WATCH RB Matt Tenison DEFENSIVE PLAYER TO WATCH DL Daylon Markham COMMENTS Harding is 27-6 over the past three seasons, the most victories in program history over a three-year period. … Senior defensive back Trendall Stevenson is six victories away from being involved in the most victories in Harding history. … The Bisons have rushed for 3,500 yards or more in each of the past four seasons. … Only left tackle Eric Mitchell has started a game on offense for the Bisons. … Harding has not won a conference title since winning the Arkansas Intercollegiate Conference in 1989. ""What's the deal with that team?"" The seventh-year head coach, who arrived in 1986 as an assistant, is never offended. Harding has been to the NCAA Division II playoffs twice in the past three seasons and has won 27 games in that span, easily the most successful run since moving to that level in 1997. ""It's a legitimate question,"" Huckeba said. He has a good answer, too. Harding enters this season picked to finish second in the Great American Conference and ranked in two national preseason polls. The American Football Coaches Association ranks the Bisons No. 21, and D2football.com has them at No. 19. Those rankings acknowledge a swift ascent from five years ago, when Huckeba was beginning his fourth season with a new offense and a 13-19 overall record. Since, the Bisons have averaged more than seven victories a season and have gone 9-2 in each of the past three seasons. Huckeba said the main thing that has helped the team turn the corner is the triple-option offense that he and his staff are committed to running and a recruiting philosophy that focuses on finding a certain type of player. ""Our guys are extremely accountable,"" Huckeba said. ""We have really set the bar high for what that means. Everything from where you sit in the meeting room, your focus, the level of intensity with which you practice. Just the team work ethic. That encompasses the entire year."" This year, more than any other, will be a gauge for whether Huckeba's program has become established. Harding lost 10 starters from an offense that was second nationally in rushing (371.7 yards per game) and fourth in scoring (44.3 points per game) in 2014. Among the losses were two-year starting quarterback Keenan Kellett, leading rusher Romo Westbrook, who had 1,215 yards, and leading receiver Donatella Luckett, who averaged 26.2 yards per reception and scored 5 touchdowns. When Harding opens its season Saturday at Oklahoma Baptist, only left tackle Eric Mitchell will have started a game on offense. Only five players on defense have started a game, including senior defensive back Trendall Stevenson. He's six victories away from being a part of more victories than any other Harding player, but he will enter his senior season still trying to do what no Division II team in Arkansas has done yet -- win a playoff game. Harding has been there twice in the past three years. It lost to Northwest Missouri State 35-0 in 2012 and 59-42 at Pittsburg State last year. ""The first time, that was just an introduction,"" Stevenson said. ""This last time, it was something different about the team. We believed that we could do it. We've been two times and we've fallen short, but every guy that's on this team understands how to overcome it."" Huckeba said he feels good about running backs Matt Tenison and Michael Latu and quarterback Park Parish, a junior from Clinton. Parish has played in 15 games with no starts, but Huckeba said he has more big-play potential than Kellett. ""He's a home-run hitter and Keenan was not,"" Huckeba said. Parish said he feels comfortable in an offense with so many players who have so little experience. ""We want [opponents] to think that we're not going to be any good so we can surprise them,"" Parish said. ""That's what we want them to think."" Not many overlook Harding anymore, and Huckeba said that has to do with its dedication to the system and method. ""We really like how we play the game,"" he said. ""We are totally sold on the triple-option offense, ball control, keep it away from your opponents and burn up the clock. Run the football, go for big plays, play great defense and be solid on special teams. ""We think that's a winning formula, and it has been for us."" Sports on 09/02/2"
323,"The iconic rock band the Rolling Stones are set to release their first album in over a decade. This much-awaited announcement was made by the band's guitarist, Keith Richards. In an interview with a leading news outlet, Richards stated that the band has been working on new music during the pandemic-induced downtime. He further revealed that fans can expect to hear ""some good music"" on their new album, which is expected to be released later this year. This would be the band's first album since ""Blue & Lonesome,"" which was released in 2016. The upcoming album will also mark the band's first studio album of original material since ""A Bigger Bang,"" released back in 2005. The band members have been staying in touch and working on new material remotely during the pandemic, according to Richards. The guitarist stated that the band was able to bond over the shared experience of isolation and uncertainty during the pandemic. The Rolling Stones were scheduled to embark on a tour in 2020, which was postponed due to the pandemic. However, with the announcement of the upcoming album, fans will have something to look forward to from the legendary band. The Rolling Stones' music has been a part of the cultural lexicon for over half a century. With hits such as ""Satisfaction,"" ""Gimme Shelter,"" and ""Paint it Black,"" the band has left an indelible mark on the world of music. And with their upcoming album, they seem set to continue that legacy.","New York (AFP) - Rock legends The Rolling Stones have decided to record a new album in what would be their first in a decade, guitarist Keith Richards said. Richards, at an event Tuesday evening to promote his latest solo album, said that the Stones planned to return to the studio after a hitherto unannounced tour of South America in early 2016. ""Actually, I was in London last week and the boys and I got together. And, yeah, there are now definite plans to record,"" Richards told a forum in New York organized by Internet radio station iHeartRadio. The now septuagenarian rockers have toured actively in recent years, recently completing a summer swing through North America, but have not released a new album since ""A Bigger Bang"" in 2005. That album, in turn, was the first by The Rolling Stones in eight years. The Rolling Stones are widely regarded as one of rock's defining acts, producing classic albums such as ""Sticky Fingers"" and ""Exile on Main St."" and feuding with The Beatles for the crown of Britain's top band. Richards, known for his hard-living and cantankerous public comments, on Friday releases ""Crosseyed Heart,"" his first solo album in 23 years. The album -- featuring Richards, rather than Stones frontman Mick Jagger, on vocals -- brings in a range of collaborators including the jazz and blues singer Norah Jones."

325,"Croatia has closed several border crossings as thousands of migrants stream into the country, trying to make their way towards northern Europe. The move comes after Hungary closed its own border with Croatia, blocking the main route for migrants to enter the EU. The migrant crisis has been ongoing for months now, with hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing war and poverty in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and other parts of the Middle East and Africa. They have been making their way through Turkey, Greece, and the Balkans in hopes of reaching the more prosperous countries of northern Europe, such as Germany and Sweden. The closure of the Croatian border crossings has created a new bottleneck in the migrant route. The country had been a popular alternative to Hungary for the migrants, with some 10,000 people crossing into Croatia each day. Now, with the border crossings closed, it is unclear where the migrants will go next. Many of the migrants are now stuck in Serbia, which lies just east of Croatia. Serbian authorities are struggling to cope with the influx of people, and have accused Croatia of ""dumping"" refugees on their doorstep. Meanwhile, the situation is worsening in the makeshift camps set up by the migrants in Serbia, with reports of disease outbreaks and lack of basic facilities. The closure of the Croatian border crossings has also led to tensions between the two countries. Croatia has accused Serbia of not doing enough to prevent the mass migration, while Serbia has accused Croatia of using aggressive tactics to stop refugees from crossing the border. The international community has been watching the situation closely, with many expressing their concern over the plight of the migrants. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Antonio Guterres, has called for greater cooperation among European nations to help the refugees. ""The current response, characterized by a fragmented, uncoordinated approach, inadequate resources and a lack of solidarity, is leading to chaos and suffering for those caught in the middle,"" he said in a recent statement. Meanwhile, many European countries have been tightening their borders in response to the migrant crisis. Germany, which had previously welcomed large numbers of refugees, recently announced that it would be reintroducing border controls, while Sweden has implemented similar measures. Austria, which lies just west of Hungary, has also been struggling to cope with the influx of migrants, and has threatened to build a fence along its own border with Slovenia. The issue has become a major political challenge for European leaders, with many struggling to find a solution that is both humane and effective. The EU has proposed a plan to distribute 120,000 refugees across member states, but the proposal has met with resistance from several countries, including Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. The situation is likely to remain tense in the weeks and months ahead, as the migrant crisis shows no signs of abating. For the refugees themselves, the journey has been long and arduous, and it is likely to become even more difficult as winter approaches. Many will be hoping that Europe will find a way to address the crisis and offer them a safe haven from the wars and poverty that have driven them from their homes.","AT THE HUNGARIAN-SERBIAN BORDER (CNN) – A day after Croatia opened its border to migrants, the country changed tack Thursday, closing seven border crossings with Serbia after thousands of people streamed in. In just two days, more than 11,000 migrants have entered Croatia from Serbia. Now “until further notice,” the Croatian Interior Ministry said on its website, traffic is banned on roads leading to the seven border crossings. Things started out smoothly, with police coaxing frightened migrants across the border Wednesday. But by Thursday, chaos erupted as thousands of people broke through police barriers set up at the train station in the border town of Tovarnik. Women were wailing and police tried to help children as masses of people pushed their way out of the holding area set up for processing. Police did not use force against the migrants, as they tried to keep the barriers in place. They finally gave up and the migrants started running into Croatia. Terence Pike, with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Croatia, told CNN that Croatian authorities had been prepared to handle only an influx of 500 migrants and refugees a day. “I think that too many refugees entered in an uncontrolled way on the first day,” said Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic. ”Yes, of course, Croatia showed a human face, but I stress that the safety of Croatian citizens and the stability of the state comes first,” she said. Croatia can’t care for and satisfy the needs of so many people, she said, calling for tougher surveillance across state borders. Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said the capacity to take in migrants has been reached. By nightfall, police set up a new perimeter in an attempt to stop more than 1,000 migrants from penetrating farther into Tovarnik, where bullet holes left over from the Balkan wars of the 1990s still scar some buildings. Croatia became the latest pressure point in the migrant crisis after Hungarian riot police used tear gas and water cannons Wednesday to turn back people at that country’s border with Serbia. Migrants attempting to reach Western Europe were left with a difficult choice: Stay and contend with Hungary’s tough new border defenses, or set out through Croatia on another uncertain path toward the European Union’s wealthier nations. Frustrations boiled over after Hungary had sealed the final hole in its border with Serbia a day earlier, shutting off a popular route used by tens of thousands of people in Europe’s vast migrant crisis. The move left desperate men, women and children — most of them fleeing violence in the Middle East — blocked by a razor-wire fence from entering. But the impasse at that entry point into the European Union won’t stop the flow of migrants attempting their arduous journeys, said Eugenio Ambrosi, regional director of the International Organization for Migration. “People will continue to try to reach Europe through Hungary, Croatia or any other route that might be available to them,” he told CNN. After Croatia, migrants are expected to try to reach Germany by traveling up through Slovenia and then Austria. But it’s unclear whether they’ll ultimately fare better on that route. Slovenia Prime Minister Miro Cerar tweeted Thursday that his country is committed to protecting the EU’s external borders. The Slovenian Interior Ministry said it hadn’t discussed with Croatia the possibility of providing a safe corridor to migrants and that such a move would violate national and European laws. The ministry said it would carry out its “obligations to manage migration and control its borders” and expected Croatia to do the same. Croatia is a member of the European Union, but unlike its northern neighbors, it isn’t part of the Schengen Agreement that eliminated border controls between many EU nations. Some people gathered at the Serbian-Hungarian border said they were wary of taking the Croatian route if it meant they would only end up stuck at yet another closed crossing. They say turning around and heading back to the troubled countries they fled — such as Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea and Iraq — isn’t an option. The current crisis has prompted other EU nations to reintroduce security measures at borders with other member states. Austrian Interior Ministry spokesman Karl-Heinz Grundboeck said his country had started border control measures on its southern border with Slovenia. Germany’s minister for migration and refugees resigned “for personal reasons” on Thursday. Manfred Schmidt had been criticized for the slow process of dealing with asylum application and creating a backlog. At the end of August, 276,617 applications still needed to be processed, according to a ministry spokesperson. “Dr. Schmidt has done an excellent job and the federal interior minister regrets losing him as head of this office,” German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said in a statement. Aid workers say Europe is facing its largest refugee and migrant crisis since World War II. More than 430,000 migrants have come to Europe by sea so far this year, double the number that arrived during all of 2014, the International Organization for Migration said. Migrants typically cross the Mediterranean and try to go through Greece, Macedonia, Serbia, Hungary and Austria before finally reaching Germany or other European countries known to be welcoming to refugees. The EU is still trying to figure out how to distribute 160,000 migrants — and whether to set quotas for member countries to absorb them. “The crisis is moving quite fast — and unfortunately is moving much faster than the response that was put in place by all the concerned governments,” said Ambrosi of the IOM."
326,"South Korea's deeper China embrace stirs the pot of North Asian politics South Korea's increasing economic embrace of China is causing concern among its traditional allies in the region, including Japan and the United States. The world’s 11th-largest economy, South Korea, has been steadily strengthening ties with China, its largest trading partner, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated this trend. According to recent data from South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy, China accounted for nearly 27% of South Korea's total trade last year. Meanwhile, South Korea's trade with Japan and the United States was less than 10%. Moreover, South Korea's strategic importance to the US at a time of geopolitical tensions with China is being called into question as South Korea appears to be moving closer to China's orbit. In December 2020, South Korea and China signed a landmark trade agreement, which is expected to further boost trade and investment between the two countries. The trade deal came on the back of China's economic coercion against Australia, which led to a sharp increase in Chinese imports of Australian goods to South Korea. Although the diplomatic spat between China and Australia was not the impetus behind the trade agreement, it has certainly added to the sense of unease among South Korea's traditional allies. In addition to the trade agreement, South Korea and China have also been deepening their cultural and educational exchanges. Last year, South Korea withdrew from a military intelligence-sharing agreement with Japan, which was seen as a sign of Seoul's growing estrangement with its neighbor and close ally of the US. South Korea's move has further complicated the already fraught relationships between Japan and China, and between South Korea and Japan, which are both mired in historical grievances. As for the US, South Korea's tilt towards China raises questions about its reliability as an ally in the region. The US has long relied on South Korea as a key strategic partner in its efforts to contain China's rise, but South Korea's deepening ties with China could potentially undermine this partnership. Some analysts argue that South Korea's closer relationship with China should not be seen as a zero-sum game, but rather as part of its efforts to diversify its economy and reduce its reliance on the US. The South Korean government has emphasized that its alliance with the US remains strong and that it is committed to denuclearizing North Korea. However, as South Korea continues to deepen its ties with China, its traditional allies in the region are becoming increasingly concerned about the implications for regional security and stability. Japan has been particularly critical of South Korea's pivot towards China, with some Japanese officials expressing concern that it could lead to the formation of a China-South Korea-Japan axis that would marginalize US influence in the region. Meanwhile, the US has been urging South Korea to maintain a delicate balance between its economic ties with China and its strategic partnership with the US. It remains to be seen how South Korea's deepening ties with China will play out in the long term, but one thing is clear: the shifting geopolitical landscape in North Asia is sparking concerns among traditional allies and stirring the pot of regional politics.","Seoul: At the height of the Korean Peninsula tensions last month, South Korean loudspeakers blared propaganda messages across the DMZ to hundreds of thousands of troops stationed over the border in the North. Designed to chip away at morale, the taunts infuriated the North Korean leadership. President Park has met with President Xi in China three times! the speakers boomed. How many times has Kim Jong-un met with President Xi? The answer: none. ""If the North Korean people knew that they would probably be quite shocked,"" said veteran China watcher, journalist and commentator Jong-dae Ha, from South Korea's highest circulating newspaper, Dong-A Ilbo. ""I don't think Kim Jong-un was too happy watching that parade."" ""That parade"" was China's commemorative World War II military spectacular, held in Beijing on September 3. South Korean President Park Geun-hye raised eyebrows as she stood, resplendent in yellow, just a Russian president away from China's Xi Jinping, watching Beijing's conspicuous display of manpower and hardware. Park was the only leader of a US ally to attend. That the occasion gave the Chinese an excuse to bring out the good silverware (like the new DF-21D anti-ship ""carrier killer"" missile) so troubled Western leaders, they stayed away in droves. (Australia sent Veterans Affairs minister Michael Ronaldson, also known in China as ""Who?"".) North Korea's Kim Jong-un was not at the parade. His envoy didn't even get the front row, let alone a seat near Putin. Park's attendance was highly controversial in South Korea, and a curious look for a major US ally. ""[It's] a big puzzle to many even among her supporters,"" says Hyung-A Kim, Associate Professor of Korean politics at the Australian National University. In Seoul, everyone has a theory. This is north-east Asia, where an infernal tangle of alliances, frozen hostilities, superpower tensions and historical grievances sits alongside ever-deepening trade flows and shifting power plays. Nothing is simple, and symbolism is important. South Korean media chalked it as a victory for Park, not a scoop for Beijing or a rebuff to the US. She was there to press Beijing for its support for Korean unification at a time when Beijing's patience with Pyongyang has run thin. That may be so, says Cho Min, from the Korean Institute for National Unification in Seoul. China's longstanding position has been that it doesn't want conflict on the peninsula, and it doesn't want Kim's regime to collapse. Therefore, ""the only help China can give, from our perspective, is by not intervening at all, so we should take every opportunity to explain that to them"". It is not clear whether Kim wasn't invited to the parade or refused to go after demands for special treatment were turned down. But the China-North Korea relationship has been strained at least since Kim executed his uncle, the former chief China envoy Chang Song-taek, in December 2013. Ha said the problems go back further, to the sudden ascent of the 28-year-old Kim to North Korea's leadership in 2011. ""From Xi's point of view, Kim Jong-un is just a young man. Park is the same age as Xi and they have shared experiences. So he's probably not the right partner to sit down and have a heart-to-heart with Kim Jong-un,"" said the journalist Ha. Park has held six summit meetings with Xi, three of them in China, since she was elected in 2013. During the flare-up of Korean Peninsula tensions in August, the Chinese exerted pressure on the North Koreans to stand down, moving Chinese troops to the North Korean border and letting that be known in the Chinese press. ""Chinese cooperation was provided to a certain extent, and that is why President Park attended the parade,"" said Ha. Further, the South Koreans were pleased that the Chinese chose the occasion of Park's visit to declare a push to resume the six-party talks, a sort of world's-grimmest dinner party where China, the US, Japan, Russia and the two Koreas sit down to try for progress on the denuclearisation of North Korea. The talks have been stalled since 2009 and China, which is the source of most of Pyongyang's food and energy, is considered to have the most sway over the North. But Hyung-A Kim points out that China has not changed its basic stance on North Korea; and that US alliance politics looms over this too. ""Despite China's visibly warm welcome to Park, there was no epoch-making agreement between Park and Xi, just as there was no fundamental change in China's North Korea policy,"" she said. ""She attended the military parade mainly to show the change in her government's diplomatic approach, especially to expand [South] Korea's own diplomatic space by resisting US pressure to turn down the Chinese invitation."" Park's attendance may have been ""a hot issue across the world"", said Ha, but there were also many reasons why it was reasonable she was there. The two neighbours have a long history of relations, a quarter of Korea's exports go to China, and China pressed hard for her presence. She also led a huge delegation of 156 business leaders, amid debate among Koreans over whether their economy is too dependent on China. Like Australia, South Korea's main trading partner is China and its security guarantor is the United States. Unlike Australia, South Korea doesn't have the luxury of sitting apart from its neighbours. Follow FairfaxForeign on Twitter Follow FairfaxForeign on"

328,"In what was described as a ""brutal, motiveless attack on a defenceless young woman"", a judge has sentenced Alexander Pacteau to 23 years in prison for the murder of Karen Buckley. At the High Court in Glasgow, Judge Lady Rae said that Pacteau had shown no remorse for his actions and had attempted to cover up the crime by trying to dispose of Karen's body. The 24-year-old murdered Karen, who was also 24, after meeting her at the Sanctuary nightclub in Glasgow in April 2015. He offered to give her a lift home, but instead took her to his flat and attacked her with a spanner. He then strangled her and disposed of her body in a barrel filled with caustic soda. Karen's family sat in court as the judge passed sentence, while Pacteau showed no emotion. Lady Rae said that she could not find any mitigating factors in Pacteau's case, describing his actions as ""callous, cold-hearted, and calculating"". ""Karen Buckley was a young woman with her whole life ahead of her,"" the judge said. ""She was a much-loved daughter, sister, and friend. Her family have been left devastated by her loss."" The court heard from Karen's father who described his daughter as a ""beautiful, intelligent, and independent young woman"", who had come to Glasgow to fulfil her dream of studying occupational therapy. In a victim impact statement, Karen's mother said that her family had been ""completely and utterly traumatised"" by her daughter's murder. ""Our lives will never be the same again,"" she said. Pacteau had originally denied the murder but later admitted to killing Karen. During the trial, the court heard that he had purchased the caustic soda online and had kept Karen's body in his flat for several days before he disposed of it. The court also heard that Pacteau had an interest in serial killers and had watched videos of them online. However, Lady Rae made it clear that there was no evidence to suggest that Pacteau was a danger to the public beyond Karen's murder. After the sentencing, Karen's family released a statement thanking the Scottish police and prosecution for their support. ""We will never forget Karen and the impact she had on our lives,"" they said. ""We hope that today's sentencing will provide some small measure of closure for our family."" In a separate statement, Detective Superintendent Jim Kerr of Police Scotland said that Karen's murder had ""shocked and appalled"" the community. ""Today's sentencing shows that violence against women will not be tolerated,"" he said. Karen's murder highlights the importance of ensuring that women are safe when they are out at night. As Lady Rae said, ""It is vital that young women are protected against men who have no respect for them and who are a danger to them."" It is a stark reminder that we must all play our part in creating a safer society for women.","The man who bludgeoned Irish student Karen Buckley to death with a spanner and attempted to dispose of her body in a vat of chemicals has been jailed for a minimum of 23 years. Alexander Pacteau, 21, was branded “truly evil” after admitting the crime at the High Court in Glasgow last month. Judge Lady Rae today sentenced him to 23 years for the murder of the 24-year-old, who was on a night out with friends in April when she was murdered by Pacteau. Lady Rae said Pacteau had carried out a “brutal, motiveless attack on a defenceless young woman”. She continued: ""I find it extremely difficult to find words appropriate to describe the dreadful crime to which you pleaded guilty. “Karen Buckley was a young woman in the prime of life. She was a visitor to Glasgow, studying to expand her knowledge in furtherance of her career in nursing. She was a much loved member of a close and united family. ""To you she was a stranger who appeared tragically to have accepted a lift in your car. Within a matter of minutes, for some inexplicable reason, you destroyed her young life and devastated a family."" The judge said Pacteau had gone to “extraordinary lengths” to conceal what he had done and told a “tissue of lies” and a ""concoted story"" to police investigating her disappearance. In delivering her sentence she said: ""You now, through your counsel, claim to be remorseful. Remorse was, however, only expressed for the first time when you pleaded guilty. ""From a perusal of the criminal justice social work report, it is apparent that in the course of your lengthy interviews with the social worker, at no time did you ever demonstrate or express any regret for what you had done. ""That expression of remorse on 11 August might have carried more weight if communicated earlier. And it is difficult, in my view, to envisage someone who is truly sorry for killing another human being, going to the lengths to which you went to cover up your appalling crime, whilst making up false stories about the deceased."" Miss Buckley’s parents John and Marian travelled from Cork to see Pacteau plead guilty on August 11 and were in court again today. Previous conviction The qualified nurse had only been in Glasgow for a few months before her killing. She had recently left her job at an Essex hospital and moved to Scotland to study for a masters degree in occupational health therapy at Glasgow Caledonian University. Miss Buckley was described as an outgoing woman whose life revolved around her family and friends. Pacteau, who described himself as a “self-employed sales consultant”, has a previous conviction for printing counterfeit money. It emerged after his conviction that he stood trial in 2013 at the High Court in Paisley accused of attempting to rape a woman in a Glasgow lane. He was found not guilty of the charge. In the early hours of April 12, he met Miss Buckley outside the Sanctuary nightclub and drove her to nearby Kelvin Way, where he grabbed her neck and delivered about a dozen blows with a spanner. The killer visited various shops to purchase caustic soda before placing her body in the bath at his flat. On trips to High Craigton Farm on the outskirts of the city, he burned a mattress and clothes before buying a barrel, placing Miss Buckley’s body inside and locking it in a storage unit he had rented. Pacteau initially claimed to detectives, who identified him from CCTV footage, that they went back to his flat and she had fallen and injured herself on the bed frame. His solicitor John Scullion QC said he could offer no ”rational explanation” for his actions."

The trio were charged with assault and causing criminal damage after an altercation with a group of individuals outside a local pub. The court heard that the siblings, aged between 19 and 25, became involved in a heated exchange with the group, which quickly turned violent. CCTV footage showed the siblings throwing punches and causing damage to nearby property. The incident left several individuals injured, with one requiring hospital treatment for a broken nose. The siblings were arrested at the scene and taken into police custody. In court, the siblings pleaded guilty to the charges against them. The judge described the incident as ""senseless and unnecessary"" and warned the siblings that they could face a custodial sentence. The siblings' lawyer argued that they had acted in self-defence and had been provoked by the other group. However, this defence was dismissed by the judge who stated that the siblings' actions had gone far beyond what was necessary in the circumstances. The case has been adjourned for sentencing, with the siblings remaining in custody until their next court appearance.","Twin brothers and their older sister have appeared in court charged with affray and criminal damage following an incident in Normanton on Thursday (September 24).

335,"Kim Davis, a county clerk from Kentucky, is set to appear in federal court on Thursday for a contempt hearing. This comes after Davis refused to obey a court order that required her to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, citing her religious beliefs. The controversy surrounding Davis began in June after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. Davis made headlines when she defied the court ruling and refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in her county, citing her Christian beliefs. Four couples sued Davis, and a federal judge ordered her to comply with the law and issue the licenses. However, Davis continued to refuse, and the judge ultimately held her in contempt of court. After spending five days in jail, Davis was released on the condition that she not interfere with the issuance of marriage licenses. However, Davis has still not complied with the court order and has refused to issue marriage licenses to anyone, citing her belief that it would violate her conscience to do so. On Thursday, Davis will face a contempt hearing in federal court, where she could face fines or even jail time for her refusal to issue marriage licenses. The hearing comes amid growing pressure for Davis to either fulfill her duties as a county clerk or resign from her position. However, Davis has maintained that she will not resign from her job, stating that she is being persecuted for her religious beliefs. Her supporters argue that she has the right to religious freedom and should not be forced to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. On the other hand, her detractors argue that as a public official, Davis is obligated to uphold the law and cannot use her religious beliefs as a justification for refusing to do so. The case has prompted debate across the country about the balance between religious freedom and equal rights for all citizens. Many have expressed concern that if Davis is allowed to continue refusing to issue marriage licenses, it could set a dangerous precedent and lead to further discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community. The White House has also weighed in on the controversy, with Press Secretary Josh Earnest stating that public officials cannot ""pick and choose"" which laws they wish to follow. ""When you take an oath of office and you swear to uphold the Constitution, that means you agree to abide by the law,"" he said. Thursday's hearing will likely be closely watched by both supporters and opponents of Davis, as the case continues to draw national attention.","Kim Davis, the Rowan County clerk who has been in the national spotlight for refusing to hand out marriage licenses, will appear before a federal judge this morning for a hearing on whether she should be held in contempt. The plaintiffs in the case have asked the federal judge to fine Davis until she starts issuing marriage licenses again. As we've reported , a lower court had ordered Davis to issue marriage licenses, despite her religious objections. She appealed and then went all the way up to the Supreme Court to ask that the lower court's decision be put aside while she waited for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit to issue an opinion on the matter. On Monday, the Supreme Court denied that stay , tacitly ordering Davis to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Davis has refused. In a motion filed with the court yesterday , her lawyers argued that it is presently ""impossible"" for Davis to comply with the court order because it would ""irreparably and irreversibly violates her conscience by directing her to authorize and issue SSM licenses bearing her name and approval."" Legal scholars disagree with that assessment. Here's how Katherine Franke, a law professor at Columbia University where she heads the Public Rights/Private Conscience Project , explained it to NPR's Robert Siegel earlier this week : FRANKE: She has absolutely no legal ground to stand on. As a public official, she's supposed to abide by the law and perform her public duties, which are issuing marriage licenses to qualified couples. Same-sex couples are now qualified to marry in the state of Kentucky, so she is refusing to do her job. SIEGEL: But are there protections - even for public officials - for some religious convictions that might, in some ways, conflict with someone else's performance of the same job? FRANKE: Of course. Kim Davis has all sorts of religious liberty rights secured under the First Amendment and under other laws. But they are not at stake in this case. All she's asked to do with couples that come before her is certify that they've met the state requirements for marriage. So her religious opposition to same-sex marriage is absolutely irrelevant in this context. It's worth noting that in an amicus brief filed yesterday , Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers asked the court to ""temper its response."" The laws of the state, argues Stivers, have not yet caught up with the Supreme Court decision that made same-sex marriage legal across the whole United States. In fact, Stivers argues, state law currently contains penalties for performing prohibited marriages — such as those between people who are ""nearer of kin ... than second cousins"" — but does not contain penalties for refusing to issue licenses to those who are permitted to marry. So, Stivers argues, the court should slow down and let the legislature sort this out before holding Davis in contempt."
336,"The highly-anticipated season 2 of Fox's hit series ""Empire"" premiered in New York City last night and the cast had a lot to say about what went on behind the scenes. CJAD 800 was on the red carpet and got the scoop on their pre-show secrets. The series, created by Lee Daniels and Danny Strong, revolves around the Lyon family and their extremely successful record company, Empire Entertainment. The family drama, music and power struggles are just some of the reasons why this show is so loved by fans around the world. Taraji P. Henson, who plays Cookie Lyon, the matriarch of the family, was excited to meet the fans who came out for the event. ""It's overwhelming and beautiful,"" she said. ""These people have been waiting for us and we're finally here. We're back!"" she exclaimed. Terrence Howard, who plays Lucious Lyon, the patriarch of the family, revealed that he has an interesting ritual before each episode. ""I always pray before we start filming,"" he said. ""I have to be in the right mindset to play Lucious. He can be so cruel and ruthless, so I need to clear my head and make sure I'm ready."" Jussie Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon, the middle child struggling with his sexuality, revealed that he listens to a lot of music to get into character. ""I have a playlist that I listen to before each episode,"" he said. ""It helps me get into the emotional space that Jamal is in. Music is such a big part of this show."" Bryshere Y. Gray, who plays Hakeem Lyon, the youngest child and aspiring rapper, revealed that he has a pre-show ritual with his co-star Jussie Smollett. ""We tell each other jokes to lighten the mood,"" he said. ""The show can be pretty heavy at times, so we like to laugh with each other."" The evening was not just about the cast, but also about the music. The show has a star-studded soundtrack that features popular artists such as Alicia Keys and Pitbull. Snoop Dogg, who is featured on the soundtrack, spoke to CJAD 800 about what it was like to work on the show. ""It was an honor to work with Lee Daniels,"" he said. ""He's a visionary and he knows what he wants. I loved being a part of this project."" The fans who attended the event were treated to a sneak peek of the first episode of season 2 and their reactions were overwhelmingly positive. ""It was amazing,"" said one fan. ""The music, the drama, the fashion, it was everything I wanted and more!"" Another fan remarked on the show's ability to tackle important social issues. ""I appreciate how 'Empire' addresses things like police brutality and homophobia,"" she said. ""It's important to have these conversations and I'm glad the show is sparking them."" The cast was tight-lipped about what fans could expect in season 2, but teased that it would be just as exciting, if not more so, than season 1. ""We're going bigger and better,"" said Henson. ""Just wait and see."" As the night came to a close, the cast thanked their fans for the support and expressed their gratitude for being a part of such a groundbreaking show. ""We know we have big shoes to fill,"" said Smollett. ""But we're ready for the challenge."" In conclusion, the cast of ""Empire"" had a lot to say about their pre-show rituals and the premiere of season 2. A night filled with laughter, music, and anticipation, the event left fans eagerly awaiting the return of the hit series. ""Empire"" has proven to be more than just a show, but a cultural phenomenon that speaks to audiences around the world.",", EDT. NEW YORK, N.Y. - The cast of the hit series ""Empire"" were tight-lipped about the drama that unfolds on the upcoming second season, but when it came to discussing secrets about the show before it had its launch earlier this year — they were revealing. Emmy nominee Taraji P. Henson, Terrence Howard, creator Lee Daniels and more from the top-rated Fox show premiered the season two opener at Carnegie Hall in New York City on Saturday in front of a feverish audience. Howard entered the prestigious venue, where few from the hip-hop world have performed, with his fist up in the air and yelled ""Empire!"" as the audience applauded. The cast sat tightly on the second level at the hall and even took a selfie, directed by Henson. But after the juicy episode aired, the show's producers and cast, including Jussie Smollett and Gabourey Sidibe, sat down for a Q&A that was hilarious and intense, but overall, in the show's fashion, dramatic — curse words and all. ____ HENSON: 'EMPIRE' IS MOVING THE NEEDLE Henson, Daniels and the cast spoke at length about how they were surprised that a series like ""Empire"" had found success on prime-time television, or as Henson put it, ""free TV."" The first season of the show, starring Howard as drug dealer-turned rapper-turned record label owner Lucious Lyon, has seen ratings grow each episode and its finale drew 17 million viewers. ""I honestly thought, 'This would be great. We will put this incredible work in the can and Fox would choke and put it on cable,"" said Henson, who earned an Emmy nomination for playing Cookie Lyon. ""And I get the call that the show is picked up. I was like, 'What! Are they crazy?'"" ""You want to do the work that's going to challenge people to think and ruffle feathers and get people upset and spark intelligent conversations so that change can happen,"" she continued. Henson also said ""Empire"" is more than just a TV series and called her and Howard's characters, former drug dealers, ""heroes in a very American way."" ""'Cause you can judge (Cookie), you can say whatever you want about her, about Lucious, about what they did to get where they are, but at the end of the day, their sons are not statistics. OK. Their sons are not in jail ... they broke a cycle of poverty and anybody that's from the hood knows that that is very hard to do,"" she said and earned applause. ""It's very hard to do. To break (the cycle) and I don't mean break it for yourselves, but it for your sons, for the black boys that are coming up."" Daniels, who produced ""Monster's Ball"" and directed ""The Butler,"" also got political after thanking the chairman-CEOs of Fox Television Group, Dana Walden and Gary Newman, for their support with ""Empire."" ""I want to say to them, 'Thank you for letting me do tonight because tonight is so important for me.' Where we are right now in America with race relations is an ugly place and it's time we tear the roof off this mother (trucker),"" he said. ____ SMOLLETT AUDITIONED FOR ROLE SINGING 'BLURRED LINES' Smollett, who plays an openly gay singer and succeeded his father to run Empire Entertainment, said he auditioned for the role of Jamal by singing Robin Thicke's ""Blurred Lines"" a cappella. ""I love Robin Thicke! Robin Thicke is talented, I have his albums, but this one sang it a capella,"" Henson said. Smollett went on to sing it live without background beats or a band at Carnegie Hall. ""I sent Lee a message, I said, 'He is the baddest b---- in the room,'"" Howard said of Smollett. ____ LET'S DANCE The singing for Smollett didn't end there. Following the Q&A, he and his TV brother, Bryshere ""Yazz"" Gray, went on to perform popular songs from the series, including ""Drip Drop"" and ""You're So Beautiful."" During the latter, Sidibe — whose screen credits include ""Precious"" and ""American Horror Story"" — joined the duo onstage. She whipped her hair back and forth, twirled and twerked. ____ GABBY GETS SERIOUS Sidibe, who plays an assistant named Becky on the series, said the script originally called for a ""boyish, petite white woman."" ""And Lee said, 'If you like the script, you can just ignore that and we'll figure it out,'"" said Sidibe, who worked with Daniels on ""Precious."" And then she got deep. ""You guys don't understand, Lee is the first person in the entire world that has looked at me, looked my skin colour, looked at my body, looked at my talent and said, 'Perfect.'"" ____ TARAJI WANTED LEAD ROLE IN 'PRECIOUS' Speaking of ""Precious,"" Henson said she auditioned for the role of Clareece ""Precious"" Jones, an overweight, illiterate and abused teen. ""I'm a little nuts,"" said Henson, who explained that Daniels wanted her to audition for the role of Precious' teacher, played by Paula Patton. ""And I was like, 'That ain't the role, the role is Precious!'"" Henson said. ___ I'M A RAPPER, NOT AN ACTOR Ta'Rhonda Jones, who plays the role of Henson's assistant Porsha, said when she auditioned for the show, she thought it was a rap gig. ""I walked in the door pretty blinded. I originally thought I was going to be a rapper for Terrence Howard because that's what my brother called me and told me,"" said Jones, a rapper who had never acted. ""Terrence Howard was looking for female rappers in their 20's and I thought he was trying to come out with a 'Hustle & Flow' (record) label."" The audience burst into laughter. Jones also admitted she didn't even know who Daniels was. ""I thought he was some crazy man,"" she said. ____ The second season of ""Empire"" premieres Sept. 23 on Fox.

337,"The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, located in Massachusetts, was hit with devastating news on Friday when the federal government announced it would revoke 321 acres of the tribe's land held in trust. This decision dealt a major blow to the tribe's hopes of building a $1 billion casino complex in Taunton, Massachusetts, and created shockwaves throughout the region's casino industry. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) announced on its website that it will ""disestablish"" the trust status of the Mashpee Wampanoag's land, effectively stripping the tribe of its right to use the land for economic development purposes. This decision, which comes after years of back-and-forth legal battles over the tribe's right to the land, has been met with shock and disappointment from tribal leaders and supporters. ""It's a significant blow to the tribe, both economically and culturally,"" says Cedric Cromwell, Chair of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribal Council. ""We're a sovereign nation, and for the government to come in and take away our land is a direct attack on our people and our way of life."" The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe has been fighting for years for the right to use the land, which the tribe says is a part of its ancestral territory. In 2015, the Bureau of Indian Affairs placed the land in trust for the tribe, allowing the Mashpee Wampanoag to begin plans for a casino complex that would include a gaming facility, hotel, and entertainment venue. However, opponents of the project, including some lawmakers and neighboring communities, argued that the tribe did not have a legitimate claim to the land and that the casino project would be detrimental to the surrounding area. In 2018, the Trump Administration overturned the BIA's 2015 decision, and the tribe has been fighting in court ever since to have it reinstated. Friday's decision was a major setback for the tribe's hopes of resurrecting the casino project. The land in question is considered the only viable location for the complex, and without it, the project is effectively dead. That means the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe will lose out on an estimated $10 million in annual gaming revenue, as well as the thousands of jobs the casino complex would have created. ""It's not just about the money,"" says Cromwell. ""This is about our right to self-determination and our ability to provide for our people. It's a terrible day for the Mashpee Wampanoag community."" The decision also has broader implications for the casino industry in Massachusetts. The state has already seen significant growth in the industry in recent years, with two major casino complexes opening just over the border in Rhode Island. The Mashpee Wampanoag project would have been the largest in the state, and would have given Massachusetts a major foothold in the region's casino market. Now, the industry is left wondering what the future holds. The loss of the Mashpee Wampanoag project is a major blow to the state's revenue projections and could hurt the prospects of other casino projects currently in development in the state. ""There's no doubt this is a significant setback for the industry,"" says Michael Levenson, President of the Massachusetts Gaming Commission. ""The Mashpee Wampanoag project represented a major opportunity for the state, and losing it is a major disappointment."" For the Mashpee Wampanoag community, the fight is far from over. Cromwell says the tribe will continue to explore legal options to have the decision overturned, and will continue to fight for its sovereignty and economic development interests. ""We're not going to give up,"" says Cromwell. ""We've been here for thousands of years, and we're not going anywhere. We'll keep fighting until we win.""","TAUNTON - A cloud of uncertainty hanging over the Massachusetts casino market has cleared. The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe announced last Friday that the federal Department of the Interior has approved its request for an initial reservation, including a 152-acre site in Taunton, where the tribe plans to build a casino. The decision comes as the state’s Gaming Commission weighs whether to license a commercial casino in Southeastern Massachusetts. Mass Gaming & Entertainment’s proposal for a casino in Brockton — 17 miles north of Taunton — is the only commercial proposal still in contention for this region. “This is a timely decision, as the Massachusetts Gaming Commission wrestles with whether to issue a commercial casino license in that region,” state Senate President Stan Rosenberg said in a statement. “I believe the MGC has the responsibility to weigh the significant market over saturation that would no doubt occur with multiple resort casinos in the southeastern region.” The Mashpee are pursuing a casino through the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which is outside of the state’s commercial licensure process. Under the federal law, a tribal casino must be built on sovereign tribal land. A compact between the state and the tribe stipulates that a tribal casino in Taunton would pay the state 17 percent of its gambling revenue in lieu of taxes, provided there are no commercial casinos in Southeastern Massachusetts, an area defined as Bristol County, Plymouth County and the Cape and Islands. If another casino were built in the region, however, the tribe would pay no casino revenue to the state. Commercial casinos, meanwhile, are taxed at 25 percent. “That’s a huge advantage,” Clyde Barrow, manager of the Northeastern Gaming Research Project, said. Barrow is also chairman of the political science department at the University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley. “Let’s imagine a $400 million-per-year casino taxed at 25 percent. That’s a $100 million advantage on marketing the casino, comping rooms, building customer loyalty and maintaining amenities.” Mass Gaming & Entertainment has long maintained that a casino in Brockton would be successful with or without a competing tribal casino in Taunton, although it would be more successful without the competition. “We believe, based on experience and significant market research, that a casino in Brockton would be successful even with a tribal casino in Taunton,” Joe Baerlein, a spokesman for Mass Gaming & Entertainment, said. “We would not be applying for the Region C license and committing our own significant funds if we were not confident in this project.” The state Gaming Commission has previously stated it is on track to vote in early 2016 on a commercial license in Southeastern Massachusetts, which the panel has designated “Region C.” Page 2 of 2 - A discussion on Region C was on the agenda for the commission’s Sept. 24 meeting. “The decision by the U.S. Department of Interior to approve land into trust is a milestone for the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe,” Gaming Commission spokeswoman Elaine Driscoll said. “This determination provides further important information for the decisions the commission must make in the weeks ahead.” State law allows for up to three commercial casinos and one slots parlor statewide. Gaming regulators have stressed that they are not obligated to award a commercial license in Region C and will evaluate the status of the tribe and a variety of economic factors before making a final decision. “The commission looks forward to continuing the discussion about the path forward as it relates to gaming in Southeastern Massachusetts and remains committed to making decisions that are based on the long-term best interest of the commonwealth,” Driscoll said. Barrow said that if a tribal casino in Taunton is certain, he wouldn’t license a Brockton casino. The proponents of a New Bedford casino cited the prospect of a Mashpee Wampanoag casino in Taunton when they announced in July that they were dropping out of the running for the Region C license. “The reluctance of lenders to provide the requisite financing is due to several factors, including the possibility of competition from a nearby Indian casino, which would pay no taxes or other compensation to the commonwealth,” KG Urban Inc. principal Barry Gosin wrote in a July 22 letter informing the Gaming Commission of his firm’s decision to abandon its proposed New Bedford casino. Baerlein, however, predicted Mass Gaming & Entertainment would find success in Brockton. “While it is likely that the Department of Interior’s decision will be challenged and litigated for years, our proposal will bring needed revenues, jobs and economic development to Brockton and the commonwealth,” he said. “We believe the Gaming Commission should continue with the Region C licensing process.” Gerry Tuoti can be reached at gtuoti@wickedlocal.com or 508-967-3137."
338,"Equity release interest rates have fallen to a record low, according to the latest data from the Equity Release Council (ERC). The average interest rate for equity release products now stands at 4.48%, down from 4.55% in July 2021. This marks the first time the rate has fallen below 4.5% since ERC records began in 2007. The ERC attributed the fall in interest rates to increased competition in the equity release market and the continued low interest rate environment. As a result, homeowners aged 55 and over are now able to release more equity from their homes at lower interest rates. David Burrowes, Chairman of the Equity Release Council, said: ""The fall in average interest rates is a positive development for homeowners looking to release equity from their properties. It highlights the growing competition in the equity release market and the increasing number of options available to consumers."" He added: ""Equity release products can provide an important source of funding for those in or approaching retirement, and it is encouraging to see the market continuing to innovate and evolve to meet the needs of consumers."" The ERC also reported a slight rise in the number of equity release products available to consumers, with 488 products on the market in August 2021, up from 483 in July 2021. This marks a significant increase from the 58 products that were available in 2007. The increase in product choice is attributed to greater innovation and demand from consumers for more flexible equity release products. Over the past few years, providers have introduced new features such as downsizing protection and inheritance guarantees to meet the needs of consumers. Steven Cameron, pensions director at Aegon, said: ""This fall in interest rates and increase in product choice is good news for those looking to release equity from their homes. It should make equity release more affordable and attractive, particularly for those who are asset rich but cash poor."" He added: ""However, it is important that consumers seek independent financial advice before considering equity release as an option. They should also carefully consider the impact it may have on their state benefits and inheritance plans."" Despite the increase in product choice and the fall in interest rates, equity release products remain a complex financial product that should be carefully considered before committing. Consumers should seek independent financial advice and consider all available options before deciding whether equity release is right for them. In conclusion, the fall in equity release interest rates is a positive development for homeowners looking to release equity from their properties. The increased competition in the market and the continued low interest rate environment has resulted in more innovative and flexible products that cater to the needs of consumers. However, it is important that consumers seek independent financial advice and carefully consider the potential impact on their state benefits and inheritance plans before committing to an equity release product.","As of August, the average rate for equity release lifetime mortgages had fallen to a record low of 5.82 per cent, according to Age Partnership. This has dropped from the average rate of 6.70 per cent seen in 2009, when Age Partnership started tracking rates (see graph 1). Analysis of Age Partnership’s management information looked at over 21,000 equity release customers from the last seven. Average property prices in the UK have reached a record high of £272,000, according to ONS data, which means the average housing wealth of home-owning over-55s is likely to have increased significantly. Graph 1: Average house prices and average rates for equity release lifetime mortgages since 2009 Source: ONS house price data and Age Partnership’s management information Simon Chalk, equity release expert at Age Partnership, commented: “In the last seven years, the fortunes of Britain’s mature homeowners have truly turned around. Whereas 2009 saw house prices falling in the wake of the recession, we are now seeing house prices reach new peaks, as healthy demand for homes fuels property price growth. “Simultaneously, equity release lifetime mortgage rates have fallen sharply, meaning the plans on offer are appealing to more homeowners seeking a bit of extra income or a lump cash sum than ever before. “The number of providers offering equity release plans has also widened, and with trusted household names like Legal & General launching earlier this year, customers are enjoying some of the most competitive deals we’ve ever had. Mature customers benefit from lower rates The data also shows that rates have reduced amongst all ages of equity release customers, with mature customers particularly benefitting. Age Partnership’s average 65 year old customer currently has a rate of 5.95 per cent, compared to a customer 10 years older who benefits from a lower rate of 5.74 per cent. However, both ages have seen a drop in rates to record lows since 2009 when rates were over 6.60 per cent (see graph 2). Graph 2: Average rates for 65 year old and 75 year old customers since 2009 Source: Age Partnership’s management information Rising property prices are helping to balance out the interest paid House price growth is helping to counteract the interest owed for taking out an equity release plan, meaning equity release customers can hang onto more of the equity in their house for longer. Looking at the typical Age Partnership customer this year to date, they have on average released £43,972 at an average fixed rate of 5.82 per cent on a property worth £252,951. By releasing less than 20 per cent of the value of their home, compared to an average maximum available of 34 per cent, they are evidently being sensible, taking just enough to meet whatever their needs may be. As the research table below shows, a realistic 2 per cent house price growth assumption each year will ensure they have over 80 per cent of the remaining equity left to leave to loved ones when they die. If house prices were to rise at 2 per cent a year – much lower than the current annual growth of 5.7 per cent – the average property value would have risen to £320,803 by 2027. Over the same time, the size of the equity owed would have risen to £86,694. However, this would leave total remaining equity of £234,109, up from £208,979 initially, showing the equity owned in the house would not be eroded in monetary terms. This can be seen in the table below. Table 1: House price growth and the effects of interest Source: Based on average equity release rate of 5.82 per cent p.a. and house price growth of 2.0 per cent pa Projected figures are nominal and have not been adjusted for future inflation, which would reduce their value in real terms"
339,"The Indianapolis Colts have acquired defensive lineman Christian Winn from the Cleveland Browns, in exchange for an undisclosed draft pick. Winn was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Browns in 2021 after a productive career at the University of Kansas.

340,"Microsoft has announced it is expanding its global YouthSpark initiative to focus more on computer science. The tech giant's program is aimed at making technology more accessible to low-income and underprivileged youths all around the world. YouthSpark aims to help them develop useful technological skills, obtain job training in the tech sector and set themselves up for success in the modern world. The updated program aligns with Microsoft's focus on tackling underrepresentation within the technology industry. The updated initiative aims to create more possibilities for underrepresented youths to become a vital part of the technology industry. There is a growing demand for technological advancements throughout all industries; therefore, the promise of jobs within the technology industry is ever-growing. However, underrepresented groups, including minority groups and disadvantaged children, are still unable to join in due to lack of access to digital resources, education and technology focused training. Microsoft's YouthSpark program aims to bridge that gap. Microsoft's Vice President of Corporate Affairs, Mary Snapp, stated that ""YouthSpark is all about creating opportunities for young people so that they can develop the technology skills that are increasingly in demand in today's economy, regardless of their background, geography or circumstances."" The new initiative focuses on promoting a diverse future within technology by eliminating barriers to entry to the tech industry. Through the initiative, Microsoft will provide digital resources, tools for learning and directly support organizations who are working towards making computer science education more accessible for underrepresented groups. Microsoft also aims to inspire the younger generation to pursue computer science careers. By improving the technology infrastructure of schools and underprivileged communities, Microsoft will make learning easier and more accessible for children. The program will enable the next generation to learn skills such as programming, coding and data science. There are three main components of Microsoft's YouthSpark Initiative. Firstly, it provides grants to non-profit organizations that work towards increasing young people's access to computer science education. Secondly, the program delivers coding and computer science courses to individuals all around the world by offering free online courses. Lastly, YouthSpark Training tracks have been designed to help those in need gain the necessary qualifications to apply for roles in the technology industry. The YouthSpark initiative is the innovative way Microsoft aims to provide young minds with the necessary technological tools and resources. Microsoft is providing extensive and persistent support to make sure the program makes a real difference for all underprivileged youths. Microsoft has collaborated with different organizations to ensure that this initiative makes a maximum impact. FamilyOnline Safety Institute, AIESEC, and STEMconnector are just a few of the partners who work towards the goals of the program. All of them have a common aim: Increase accessibility to tech education and training for underprivileged groups. STEMconnector facilitates innovative approaches to STEM education and workforce development. With the help of donation, this organization provides equal access to quality education and ensures that it reaches the maximum number of children in need. STEMconnector is equally committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in the space. Furthermore, the Family Online Safety Institute, another partner, aims to provide a safe online environment for internet users and disseminates educational resources to help people make safer choices online. The organization pushes for inclusiveness and diversity in its initiatives. The YouthSpark Initiative has provided Microsoft with an opportunity to set out its commitment to creating a diversity and inclusiveness culture, which is significantly lacking in the tech industry as a whole. In summary, Microsoft's YouthSpark expansion is a recognition of its role in creating opportunities for future generations' success. This program will leverage on its technological expertise to help provide economically disadvantaged and underrepresented groups with the necessary skills needed to compete in the ever-growing digital economy. Microsoft's expansion of YouthSpark is an important step towards creating a future where underrepresented groups have equal opportunity to participate and contribute within the tech industry. Through the YouthSpark Initiative, Microsoft has shown that the tech industry could be a driving force in building the future.",". announced on Wednesday a new commitment of $70 million in community investments over the next three years to increase access to computer science education for all youth, and especially for those from under-represented backgrounds.

Nigerians are eagerly awaiting the announcement of Buhari's cabinet, as they hope it will provide some clarity on the direction of the country. The delay in announcing the ministers has been attributed to the president's thorough vetting process. Buhari has stated that he plans to appoint competent individuals with integrity, who are also geographically representative of the country's diversity. However, critics argue that the delay is due to a lack of adequate planning and coordination within the administration. Nigeria has been rocked by various challenges, including insecurity, economic hardship, and corruption. Many believe that the appointment of the right team of ministers could help address these issues and set the country on the path to progress. The president has promised to tackle corruption, improve security, and revive the economy, but many question whether he has been able to keep these promises during his first term. The appointment of competent ministers is seen as a key step in delivering on these promises. In the absence of a list of ministers, there has been speculation about potential candidates. Names such as former Lagos State governor Babatunde Fashola, Nigerian lawyer and activist Femi Falana, and former Delta State governor Emmanuel Uduaghan have been mentioned by various sources. Nigerians are eager to see who will be appointed to the cabinet, as they hope the president will choose individuals who can help steer the country toward progress and development.

347,"A new study has found that even children who are riding tricycles should be wearing helmets to protect their heads. According to the research, which was published in the journal Pediatrics, an alarming number of head injuries occur in children who are riding trikes without helmets. The study was conducted over a three-year period and involved 124 children, all of whom had suffered a head injury while riding a tricycle. The majority of the children were between the ages of one and three years old, and 71 percent of them were wearing no helmet at the time of their injury. The researchers found that the most common type of head injury among the children in the study was a skull fracture. In fact, 33 percent of the children who had suffered a head injury had a skull fracture. Other common injuries included contusions, abrasions, and lacerations. The study’s authors said that the findings highlight the importance of wearing a helmet while riding a tricycle, regardless of the child’s age. “We know that helmets are effective at preventing head injuries in bicyclists, and our findings suggest that they are just as important for tricyclists,” said Dr. Nathan Kuppermann, the lead author of the study. Dr. Kuppermann also noted that many parents may not realize that tricycles can be just as dangerous as bicycles. “People tend to think of tricycles as relatively safe toys for young children,” he said. “However, our study shows that head injuries can and do occur while riding tricycles, and that helmets can make a real difference in preventing these injuries.” While the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children wear helmets while riding bicycles, there is no such recommendation for tricycles. The authors of the study are calling for that to change. “We believe that our findings provide sufficient evidence to support the use of helmets for tricycle riders,” Dr. Kuppermann said. The study has received support from organizations such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has been promoting helmet use for bicycle riders for many years. “Our research shows that helmets can reduce the risk of head injury by as much as 85 percent,” said David Strickland, the Administrator of the NHTSA. “We fully support efforts to promote helmet use for all types of riders, including tricyclists.” Parents who are concerned about their children’s safety while riding tricycles should consider purchasing a properly-fitting helmet. The helmet should fit snugly and be worn low on the forehead, with the straps fastened securely under the chin. The helmet should not be too loose or too tight, and it should not move around on the child’s head. In addition to wearing a helmet, parents should also supervise their children while they are riding tricycles. Children should only ride tricycles in safe areas, away from motor vehicles and other hazards. Parents should also make sure that the tricycle is the appropriate size for their child, and that it is in good condition. In conclusion, the results of this study provide compelling evidence that children who ride tricycles should wear helmets to protect their heads. Parents and caregivers should take this message seriously and ensure that their children wear helmets while riding tricycles. By doing so, they can help prevent serious head injuries and keep their little ones safe.","(CNN) – For the past decade, we’ve drilled into children that when they ride a bike, they need to wear a helmet. Now scientists say it may be too late: Tricycle riders should be wearing them, too. Think this is a case of safety overkill? Authors of a new study published in the journal Pediatrics say the answer is in the numbers. According to their estimates, there were 9,340 cases of tricycle-related accidents that sent children to emergency rooms in 2012 and 2013. The most common body part injured: a child’s head — and head injuries can cause lasting damage. Co-author Sean Bandzar, a medical student at the Medical College of Georgia, said he noticed a few of his small patients coming in with lacerations to the face after riding trikes. He wanted to know more about the injuries and did a medical literature search, but most of the research was limited or outdated, he said. Using data collected from 100 emergency rooms for the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, researchers found that boys are more likely than girls to turn up in the emergency room. Two-year-olds seem to have the most accidents, although there were tricycle injuries for children up to age 7. The most common broken bone was the elbow and the most common injury overall was a cut to the face. In addition to helmets, the authors suggest kids wear elbow pads, and that parents supervise their children while they ride. “We really feel strongly that the child should be able to ride in an environment free of hazards,” Bandzar said. “Have them ride away from the street and away from water.” The good news is the majority of children sent to the ER after trike accidents are treated and released. Only 224 of the more than 9,000 injured were admitted to the hospital. Deaths have increased, but not at a statistically significant rate, according to an earlier study. Knowing the types of injuries tykes on trikes may experience should help doctors make safety equipment recommendations. As an emergency room doctor in Ohio, Dr. Gary Smith has seen his share of tricycle accident patients over the years. He thinks the study is a good start, although he cautions about drawing significant conclusions from two years of data, which he considers narrow. Smith, the president of the Child Injury Prevention Alliance, has worked with similar data and said he’d love to see expanded research. Smith said he doesn’t recommend elbow pads, but helmets are a must for his own children any time they take a ride. When parents ask for advice, he tells them it’s their choice, but he has three suggestions: “Wear a helmet, wear a helmet, wear a helmet,” Smith said. His organization has done crash tests with tricycles. Injuries from falls can be significant. “Concrete is unforgiving and it doesn’t take a fall from very high to cause a serious transfer of energy. We’ve even seen a child die after a fall on concrete from only 4 feet up,” he said. “These injuries are not always this serious. I’ve also seen children come in with bruises, bumps and slight concussions, but I don’t want to take that chance with my own child.” The authors of the study in Pediatrics suggest manufacturers consider a couple of design changes to help make tricycles safer. An earlier study found that most accidents happen when a child turns the handlebars too fast and tips over or falls. Most children don’t have the depth perception or coordination yet to catch themselves or to fall without injury. Limiting the turning radius of a trike may prevent these accidents. A device that limits the maximum speed may also help, especially for children living on or riding near hills. Most tricycles don’t have brakes. Overall, Smith and the authors think riding tricycles is a good experience for children. There are even benefits to falling, with the right equipment. “I think it is important to keep children safe enough, but not as safe as possible,” Smith said. “I think we need to build resilience in children. They learn by pushing their limits and getting up after falling and dusting themselves off again. “Plus it’s important for parents to do their part to keep kids off the couch and active and not keep them in bubble wrap. We need to find that sweet spot to make sure kids are challenging themselves, but also making sure they don’t pay the price with a traumatic brain injury.”"
348,"England's head coach, Eddie Jones, has confirmed that Courtney Lawes will partner Geoff Parling in the second row for England's World Cup opener against Tonga on Sunday. Lawes, who has been in impressive form this year, will be tasked with providing the physicality and aggression that Jones demands from his locks, while Parling's lineout expertise will be crucial in securing England's set piece. Speaking to reporters at a press conference earlier today, Jones said: ""Courtney and Geoff have been working well together in training and we believe they are the best pairing for the job. Courtney brings that hard edge to our pack, while Geoff is one of the best lineout operators in the world."" Jones also confirmed that Maro Itoje would start on the bench, despite being widely expected to feature in the starting lineup. ""We're fortunate to have such depth in our second row,"" Jones added. ""Maro is a world class player and I have no doubt he will play a big role for us in this tournament, but we feel that this is the best combination for this particular match."" England are the heavy favourites to win their opening game against Tonga, but Jones insists that his team will not be taking anything for granted. ""We know that Tonga are a physical team and they will come at us with everything they've got,"" he said. ""We need to be at our best to come away with the win."" The England team for Sunday's game is expected to be announced later this week, with Jones likely to give some of his key players a rest in the run up to the tournament's tougher fixtures.","England have named an unchanged starting XV for Friday's World Cup opener against Fiji at Twickenham. The only adjustment to the 23 that dispatched Ireland 21-13 nine days ago sees hooker Rob Webber replace Jamie George on a bench that includes rugby league convert Sam Burgess. Courtney Lawes will partner Geoff Parling in the second row for England's Rugby World Cup opener against Fiji. Courtney Lawes has been chosen to partner line-out specialist Geoff Parling in the second row once again and Ben Morgan continues to be preferred to Billy Vunipola, who is selected among the replacements. The final marginal call faced by head coach Stuart Lancaster was on the wings where Jonny May and Anthony Watson will start, keeping Jack Nowell out of the 23 for a second game. Scrum-half Ben Youngs, one of seven survivors from the 2011 World Cup, will win his 50th cap when Fiji visit Twickenham. Lancaster insists England are thrilled at the prospect of playing a World Cup on home soil and welcomes the ""support of a nation"" for his team. ""The squad is massively excited to start the World Cup. Everyone has worked incredibly hard over the last three months and we are ready,"" he said. ""All the players have put their hand up in training and during the internationals we have played this summer. ""We are blessed to have such a strong squad to select from against a skilful and powerful Fijian side. ""Friday will be a great occasion for the whole squad and for the country. We are in a unique position to be playing in a World Cup on home soil and to have the support of a nation behind the team. ""That support will be a massive factor and we don't underestimate its importance. ""I'd like to congratulate Ben Youngs on his achievement.

349,"Beer shortages could create a headache for footy fans across Australia, as a workers' union plans to strike during the AFL finals. The Vic labour union claims that negotiations for wage increases have failed, and as a result, has called for a beer strike, which could see the supply of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages run dry for the grand finals. While negotiations are ongoing, the AFL has voiced concerns about the potential impact of the strike. The league warned that the absence of beer vendors during the grand finals could lead to a significant loss in revenue, as well as impact fan experience at the event. The Vic labour union is standing firm in their demands, arguing that members' wages have not kept up with the cost of living, despite earning a fraction of the profits made by Australia's major breweries. The union claims that a fair wage increase is affordable for the breweries and has vowed not to back down until their demands are met. It's unclear how long the beer strike could last, or if it could expand across the AFL finals. While the potential impact of the strike is significant, the league and the union are still hopeful a resolution can be reached before grand final day. Until then, footy fans may want to stock up on drinks before heading to the games. Alternatively, they may need to consider a sober grand final experience – which could be interesting.","A UNION is threatening work bans which will affect beer production during Victoria's AFL finals series. CARLTON and United Breweries staff at Melbourne's Abbotsford plant have voted in favour of protected work stoppages and work bans after seven months of pay negotiations broke down. Despite the impending industrial action, CUB says it has enough beer in storage to ensure there's no disruption to supply throughout the finals. CUB spokeswoman Jennifer Howard said two hour-long stoppages have already been held by warehouse workers and both had no impact on beer supply. ""There's plenty of beer for the grand final,"" Ms Howard told AAP. She said CUB would monitor the stoppages and impact on beer supplies over the coming weeks and if needed it would use their brewing and logistics network to pick up any shortfall. ""Clearly our preference is to keep the parties talking and support our customers and consumers through peak times,"" she said. The Abbotsford plant produces Carlton Draught, VB and Crown Lager beers. The opposition says Victoria's rise in industrial action was concerning. ""We've got train strikes, tram strikes, cab strikes, beer strikes, we are becoming Victoria the state of strikes,"" Liberal leader Matthew Guy said. ""In just nine months of Labor government we've descended from a stable place to live, work and invest into probably the most chaotic in Australia."" Comment has been sought from unions for the brewery workers, United Voice and the CFMEU."

Speaking to the Wharfedale & Airedale Observer, Garvey said he was approached by showrunners to make an appearance in the hit HBO series, but ultimately declined the invitation. ""I was flattered, of course, but the thought of spending days on set being roasted alive by one of those fire-breathing dragons just didn't appeal to me,"" Garvey said. Garvey, who is also a BBC 6 Music presenter, has occasionally dabbled in acting, making guest appearances in shows such as BBC One's Peaky Blinders. However, the musician says he has no plans to pursue acting as a full-time career, explaining: ""I enjoy it as a fun side project but I'm first and foremost a musician."" Garvey has recently released his debut solo album, Courting The Squall, and says his focus is on promoting the record through tour dates and other promotional activities. Despite turning down Game Of Thrones, Garvey says he is a fan of the show and hopes to be able to catch up on the latest season once he has a break from his busy schedule. ""I've heard great things about the latest season, and I'm definitely planning to catch up on it soon,"" he said. With Game Of Thrones set to come to an end after its eighth season, fans will undoubtedly be speculating on potential guest appearances in the show's final episodes. However, it seems they won't be seeing Garvey's face in Westeros anytime soon.","Elbow frontman Guy Garvey has revealed how he had to turn down a role in Game of Thrones, due to the band’s touring commitments.

Guy Garvey with his Elbow bandmates (Ian West/PA) He told BBC6′s Shaun Keaveny: “I couldn’t star in Game of Thrones even though they offered me a part because the band were touring in Australia when it happened. “I saw it and the guy that eventually did it was very good, so I’m glad they got him.

353,"Coffee is one of the world's most popular beverages, enjoyed by millions of people every day. But how much is too much? According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, moderate caffeine intake, which is about 400 mg per day, can be part of a healthy diet for most people. This is equivalent to about four 8-ounce cups of coffee. However, consuming too much caffeine can lead to negative side effects, such as jitteriness, increased heart rate, and difficulty sleeping. It can also cause dehydration, which can lead to headaches and other symptoms. The amount of caffeine in a cup of coffee can vary, depending on the type of coffee, the brewing method, and the size of the cup. A standard 8-ounce cup of brewed coffee contains about 95 mg of caffeine, while a shot of espresso contains about 64 mg. Consuming too much caffeine can also lead to coffee addiction, a condition in which the body becomes dependent on caffeine to function properly. Symptoms of coffee addiction can include headache, irritability, and fatigue. So, how much coffee should you be drinking? It depends on your individual needs, as well as the type of coffee you are drinking. If you are sensitive to caffeine, you may want to limit your consumption to one or two cups per day. If you are a heavy coffee drinker, you may need to cut back to avoid negative side effects. It is also important to consider the other sources of caffeine in your diet, such as tea, soda, and chocolate. Consuming large amounts of these products in addition to coffee can increase your overall caffeine intake and lead to negative side effects. In conclusion, while moderate coffee intake can be part of a healthy diet, consuming too much caffeine can lead to negative side effects and should be avoided. It is important to be aware of your individual needs and to monitor your caffeine intake to ensure a healthy balance in your diet.","What is a reasonable number of coffees per day? ""I had 10 yesterday,"" said the young woman drinking a 4pm latte at the local bakery cafe. That seems like rather a lot – maybe I mis-overheard her. Down the road at the Italian fruit and veg barn the checkout operator was sipping from a takeaway cup. ""Hot water,"" she said. ""I'm coffeed out. I had two at home this morning and two here."" ""How are your caffeine levels?"" is a common greeting in the specialty coffee business, where drinking too much is an occupational hazard. But how much is too much? Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines are reassuringly vague: ""Enjoy in moderation."" In the US, the Mayo Clinic hedges: up to 400 milligrams of caffeine a day ""appears to be safe for most healthy adults"". That's about four filter cups a day, or as many as six espressos on American caffeine content figures – fewer with the higher-dose espresso shots common in Australia. The real question is not ""How much?"" but ""How many is reasonable?"" In Finland the mid-morning coffee break is legislated into working conditions: as usual, Scandinavia leads in progressive social policy. In Australia it's more of a common law right; the only question is how much time you can spend away from work organising it. The mid-morning takeaway could be your second of the day if you ""need"" caffeine to get moving in the morning. One on the way back to the office after lunch would make three – still within the health guidelines, though buying two a day makes coffee a budget line item of its own. The appearance of Jawbones and Fitbits gives you the means, with a bit of honest cup-accounting and daily scrutiny of the sleep graph, to see when that third or fourth cup has sent you into sleep debt. But the accounting is complicated by an outbreak at cafes offering batch-brewed filter coffee supported by floor staff bearing refills … how many is that now? The physical symptoms of over-caffeination include jitters, anxiety, palpitations, increased heart rate, nausea and sweating: not really apparent to casual waitstaff bearing vacupots​ until you get down the list to cardiac arrest, by which time it's too late. Certificate IV in responsible service of caffeinated drinks, anyone? The story first appeared on Good Food."
354,"The start of a new television season is typically a time of excitement and anticipation for viewers, who eagerly await the premiere of new shows and the return of old favorites. But for the networks themselves, it can be a time of uncertainty and risk-taking, as they try to navigate a rapidly changing media landscape and compete for audience attention in an ever-crowded marketplace. This year is no exception, as TV networks such as ABC, CBS, and NBC roll out a slate of new shows that they hope will capture viewers' hearts and minds. But with so many options available to viewers today, it's anyone's guess which shows will succeed and which will fail. One factor that could play a significant role in the success of new shows this season is the ongoing fragmentation of the television market. With the rise of streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, more and more viewers are opting to watch TV on demand, rather than tuning in at a specific time to catch their favorite shows. This makes it harder for networks to build a loyal audience for individual shows, as viewers are more likely to dip in and out of different programs. Another challenge facing networks is the changing nature of viewers' expectations. As more and more people watch TV on their smartphones and other mobile devices, they expect to be able to access their favorite shows anytime, anywhere. This means that networks need to offer more than just traditional TV broadcasts if they want to keep viewers engaged. Despite these challenges, TV networks are still betting big on the new season, with many investing heavily in high-profile shows and talent. Whether these gambles will pay off remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the TV landscape is changing fast, and networks that can't adapt risk being left behind. In the end, it's the viewers who will decide which shows survive and which end up on the cutting room floor. So as the new season gets underway, TV networks are left to wonder: will their latest offerings catch fire, or fizzle out? Only time will tell.","Pressing questions are always asked about my prime-time viewing: My wife: “What network is ‘Brooklyn Nine-Nine’ on?” I didn’t answer. Instead, I asked: “What broadcast network did ‘The Mindy Project” air on?” She said: “NBC!” It’s a confusing media world for sure. “Mindy” was on Fox; now at Hulu; “Nine-Nine” is going into its third season on Fox, one of the few shows to grow its audience -- 4.87 million in its second season from 4.80 million viewers. So, who cares what network it’s on? Branding, schmanding! On the flip side, there are easy network brand associations: For many in my household, it can be easy to identify the content on networks like Food and Hallmark, but tough to identify specific shows. Over the weekend, I stumbled upon the team-time trial race at the World Road Cycling Championships in Richmond, Virginia -- not on NBCSN, the sports network-- but on CNBC, NBC’s business news network. I guess this make sense: This time of year I’m “cycling” in and out of stock investments in my portfolio. Seeing content in places you don’t expect? Not a trend. Still, NBC regularly uses many of its dozen or so cable networks when it has way too many Olympic events to cover. Turner airs plenty of NCAA Men’s basketball tournament games on its networks. Viacom recently aired the MTV “Video Music Awards” this year on many more of its cable networks. Much of this makes economic sense, with networks looking to monetize increasingly expensive programming assets. So with the start of the new season, does it matter that the average TV viewer might not associate new shows with their networks, like “Supergirl” and “The Muppets”? (“Supergirl” will be on CBS; “The Muppets,” ABC”). Yes, you might say broadcasters can have a strong identify: CBS has lots of crime procedurals; ABC has racy and sharp dramas. Yet in the future, established TV network brands might want to be a lot of more than they are."
355,"Pandora, the popular online music streaming service, has proven to be remarkably resilient in the face of an ever-changing and increasingly competitive music industry. Despite facing stiff competition from the likes of Spotify, Apple Music, and other streaming platforms, Pandora has continued to innovate and evolve, maintaining its position as a leading provider of music streaming services. One of the key factors in Pandora's resilience has been its strong focus on user personalization. The company's powerful recommendation algorithms help users discover new music tailored to their individual tastes, enhancing the listening experience and keeping users engaged. This personalization has played a significant role in retaining Pandora's large and loyal user base, which now comprises over 60 million active users. Another reason for Pandora's resilience has been its strong relationships with music industry stakeholders. The company has invested heavily in licensing agreements with major record labels and artists, ensuring a vast selection of music available for users to enjoy. Additionally, Pandora has been instrumental in supporting up-and-coming artists through its Music Genome Project, which helps emerging musicians gain exposure and build their audiences. In recent years, Pandora has also made significant strides in capturing a share of the lucrative on-demand music streaming market, which has traditionally been dominated by platforms like Spotify and Apple Music. By offering a Premium service that allows users to choose specific songs and albums to listen to on-demand, Pandora has positioned itself as a viable alternative to these established players. Overall, it is clear that Pandora's robust business model and focus on user personalization have helped it remain a relevant and competitive player in the music streaming space. While challenges undoubtedly remain, such as increasing competition and ongoing tensions with music industry stakeholders, the company has proven that it has the agility and adaptability necessary to weather the storm. As Pandora CEO Roger Lynch recently noted, ""we're still in the early innings of the music streaming industry, and there's still a lot of growth and innovation to come."" With its proven track record of resilience and user-focused innovation, there is little doubt that Pandora will continue to play a leading role in shaping the future of music streaming for years to come.","NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Pandora is proving to be quite resilient. Shares of the Oakland-based customized-radio company were spiking Monday on a decision by the U.S. Copyright Office that's expected to favor a payment regimen supported by the music streaming service over those of musician associations. Shares rose as much as 15% on Monday before leveling at $20.72, a gain of 5.2%. Pandora shares have been on a roller coaster ride for much of the past year amid speculation that the U.S. Copyright Royalty Board would rule in favor of music publishers and songwriters over the streaming service, and that Apple 's Music app would ultimately inexorably weaken the company. Neither has yet occurred. In an e-mailed statement, Netflix said that the U.S. Copyright Royalty Board would support Pandora's request to use the so-called Merlin/Naxos agreements as benchmarks in its final rate decision. The decision bolsters Pandora's business model of which royalty fees comprise about 50%. To pay higher fees, Pandora had argued, would jeopardize the company's ability to remain solvent. ""We are pleased that the Copyright Office affirmed the admissibility of Pandora's agreement with Merlin as a valid benchmark in the Copyright Royalty Board proceedings,"" the statement said. ""We look forward to the certainty that December's decision will bring, and are prepared to thrive in a number of potential outcomes. Our investments in the business are providing real return, including almost $1.5 billion in royalties to date."" A final decision is expected from the board on Dec. 16. Sound Exchange, an association that represents musicians on royalty issues, and had opposed Pandora in presentations before the royalty board, couldn't immediately be reached for comment. The royalty board's favorable preliminary decision comes as Pandora shares have actually gained 7.1% since Apple made public the details of its new Music app. Predictions of Pandora's decline as a result of Apple Music have thus far not materialized. That's due to a number of factors, the first being that Pandora's ad-supported service already had 79.2 million users at the end of March 31, a hefty customer base providing an ample head start. Secondly, Pandora's curated radio model appeals to listeners who may not want to be constantly selecting songs. The dueling apps are a battle between a lean-back vs. a lean-in style of music listening. And thirdly, Pandora has shown that the great bulk of its users are content to listen to ads rather than pay for subscriptions to avoid them. In effect, Pandora's biggest rival is terrestrial radio rather than services like Apple Music or Spotify ."

357,"As the state polls in Sarawak continue to approach, the Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) is advocating for the revival of Sarawak Pakatan for seat negotiation. This move comes amid a growing sense of urgency among political parties in the state, who are gearing up for the upcoming elections. Sarawak Pakatan is a political coalition that was formed in 2010, but it suffered a significant setback in the 2011 state election, when it won only 15 out of the 71 seats. However, PKR insists that the coalition still holds significant value in terms of seat negotiation, especially given the existing alignment of certain parties in the state. ""The revival of Sarawak Pakatan will allow for better coordination and help in seat distribution among the component parties,"" said a PKR spokesperson. ""This will be particularly beneficial given the current political climate in the state, which is increasingly complex and dynamic."" PKR is not the only party eyeing seat negotiation in the upcoming state polls. Other parties including the Democratic Action Party (DAP) and the Sarawak United People's Party (SUPP) have also been engaging in strategic planning and negotiations. Sarawak is a key state in Malaysia, and the upcoming state polls are expected to have a significant impact on the political landscape of the country. As such, political parties are gearing up for what is expected to be a fiercely contested election. With the revival of Sarawak Pakatan, PKR hopes to have a better chance at securing seats in the state, which could prove crucial in the overall outcome of the state polls. Whether or not the coalition will indeed be revived remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the state polls in Sarawak are set to be one of the most closely watched political events in the country this year.","The next Sarawak polls will be held by next year. ― File pic KUCHING, Sept 8 ― Sarawak PKR today urged its counterparts in the DAP to consider reviving the state’s Pakatan Rakyat (PR) pact to enable a more uniformed discussion on seat distribution for the coming state election. Sarawak PKR information chief Vernon Aji Kedit said discussions on seat allocations would not be possible without DAP’s agreement to rejoin the pact. “We negotiate on the seat allocation with PAS, our partner in state PR. “We will not negotiate or discuss on the seat allocations with the DAP unless it rejoins the state PR,” he said. Kedit said DAP is more than welcomed to return to PR, pointing out that the party was never booted from the pact but had chosen to leave on its own accord. The local politician also dismissed claims that because of DAP’s departure, Sarawak PR no longer exists. The DAP left PR in Sarawak in March this year as a sign of protest against PAS’s hudud push in Kelantan. But Kedit said even without the DAP, Sarawak PR was very much “alive and kicking” with its remaining members from PKR and PAS. On the national level, PR dissolved shortly after the PAS muktamar in June this year when the Islamist party resolved to sever all ties with the DAP. DAP, PKR and PAS contested in the 2011 Sarawak elections under the state PR platform, which allowed the opposition parties to avoid multi-cornered fights in the state’s 71 seats. The next Sarawak polls will be held by next year."
358,"White Ops and DCN Report Provides First-Ever Insight Into Bot Fraud in Premium Publishing A new report released by cybersecurity firm White Ops in partnership with the Digital Content Next (DCN) has shed light on the prevalence of fraudulent bot activity in the world of digital advertising. The report, titled 'Bot Fraud in Digital Advertising: A White Ops and Digital Content Next Special Report', provides a comprehensive analysis of bot fraud in the premium publishing sector. The findings of the report are significant, as they shed light on the tactics used by fraudsters to siphon ad dollars globally. It provides an overview of bot activity and highlights the importance of transparency in advertising. According to the report, the advertising industry loses billions of dollars annually to advertising fraud, much of which is perpetrated by bots that mimic human behavior. The report found that up to 22% of programmatic ads shown on premium publishers' sites are fake, and up to 33% of programmatic video ads are also fraudulent. These figures put into perspective the scale of the problem and suggest that the issue of bot fraud is far from resolved. Even more concerning is the fact that bots can be designed to mimic human behavior, making them more difficult to detect. The report highlights the importance of greater transparency and the need for advertisers to work together with premium publishers to combat fraudulent bot activity. The report also revealed that some bot fraud is perpetrated through 'spoofing', where fraudsters create fake websites or apps that deceive advertisers into thinking that their ads are being displayed in premium environments. In these instances, the fraudsters pocket the advertising revenue that should have gone to the publisher or legitimate website. The report states that, ""it's important for the digital advertising industry to recognize the extent of this problem - not only in terms of the money lost but also in the resulting lack of consumer trust."" This lack of trust can ultimately lead to a decline in advertising revenue. To combat bot fraud, the report recommends that advertisers and publishers work together to ensure greater transparency across the advertising supply chain. It also recommends that advertisers make use of tools to detect fraudulent activity, such as those provided by White Ops. An area of particular concern highlighted in the report is the prevalence of bot fraud in video advertising. Video advertising is a major part of the digital advertising industry and, according to the report, it is particularly vulnerable to bot fraud. This is because fraudsters can earn significant revenue by serving fraudulent video ads, which are often more expensive than other ad formats, such as display ads or text ads. The report recommends that premium publishers take steps to mitigate the risk of bot fraud in their video advertising by implementing fraud detection technologies and enforcing ad quality criteria. Advertisers are also encouraged to utilize third-party verification partners to ensure that their ads are being displayed in premium environments. The report concludes that the prevalence of fraudulent bot activity in the premium publishing sector poses a significant risk to the industry as a whole. It highlights the need for publishers and advertisers to work together to tackle the issue and ensure greater transparency across the advertising supply chain. In conclusion, the report provides the first-ever insight into bot fraud in premium publishing and highlights the scale of the problem facing the digital advertising industry. It emphasizes the importance of transparency and the need for collaboration in ensuring greater accountability in the industry. And it provides a valuable resource for publishers and advertisers looking to tackle fraudulent bot activity and ensure the long-term viability of the digital advertising industry.","NEW YORK, NY -- (Marketwired) -- 09/28/15 -- White Ops , the leader in online fraud detection for digital advertising, and Digital Content Next (DCN), the only trade association dedicated to serving the unique and diverse needs of high-quality digital content companies, today announced a benchmark report on the impact of bots on premium publishers. Yet again raising the bar for bot driven ad fraud research, White Ops analyzed 30 Billion impressions across 32 companies in the DCN membership. Most notably, the Report found only three percent of DCN advertising impressions came from bots, which are bots not listed in the industry bots and spiders list and known browser list. This percentage is one quarter and one tenth of the bot levels found in display and video inventory respectively as part of the 2014 ANA Bot Baseline research, which was also conducted by White Ops. The Report also found that employing viewability tags as a metric for quality is an inexact tool and an effective cover for bots. DCN represents the most trusted and well-respected media brands that, together, have an unduplicated audience of 230,604 million unique visitors or 100 percent reach of the U.S. online population.* In the 2015 DCN and White Ops report, 32 DCN member organizations participated and their data was collected over 53 days between June and August 2015. The sample consisted of more than 30 billion total impressions, including more than 16 billion measurable, non-mobile impressions. ""Advertising fraud is an industry-wide problem that needs to be addressed by all participants,"" said DCN CEO Jason Kint. ""This 2015 report should be seen as a tool that allows the industry to study the habits and successful performance of highly trusted premium publishers. We want to see an ecosystem in which every site can rise to the cleanliness standard of the DCN publishers detailed in this report. At the same time, our members must continue to be diligent as fraud is an evolving problem and trust is earned each and every day."" In contrast to the 2014 ANA Bot Baseline, the 2015 DCN report focused on bot levels in premium direct and programmatic inventory from nationally recognized, high volume publishers with a focus predominantly on display inventory. The 2014 ANA Bot Baseline comprised a broader set of media types, quality levels, site and campaign volumes and other parameters. Some of the most important discoveries in the new data include: Smarter than the average bot : Viewability measurement does not reveal human audience rates. Bots are extremely good at spoofing viewability in nearly three quarters of cases studied and bots that come from a host dedicated to fraud have high viewable rates and most frequently post back detailed viewability data. Equal opportunity fraud: In contrast to the nearly 70 percent of bots coming from residential sources in the earlier study, residential traffic was below 50 percent and the remainder was spread more evenly across other categories, including hosted, enterprise and carrier environments, as well as from mobile platforms. Having policy is the best policy: Bot rates appeared to be higher among publishers who sell data to third party data management platforms or were more likely to syndicate content and sell inventory through advertising networks. Searching for trouble: Small traffic recommenders and some search companies had high bot rates -- particularly when coming from certain top-level domains. ""Measure twice, cut once doesn't work if you can trick the ruler,"" said Michael Tiffany, co-founder and CEO of White Ops. ""The most lucrative websites draw the most talented criminals and bot operators have become very talented. Bots have become so sophisticated at mimicking consumer behavior that we can't trust metrics like viewability. There is no silver bullet for eradicating bot fraud. It takes vigilance, focus and a collective industry commitment to getting better -- or raising the barriers and cost for those who won't."" Cut...Then Measure While the average measured bot level was three percent, there were some premium publishers well below that rate -- in some cases, less than two percent. The policies and standards set by the DCN sample are a good starting point as to where the broader population of publishers can look to reduce bot traffic levels, thereby increasing inventory quality, including: Strictly vet third party traffic : Three of the top five publishers with the lowest sophisticated bot percentages sourced traffic from Taboola and/or Outbrain. Do not use viewability as a sole measure of humanity: Publishers with bot rates below the DCN average did not bill based solely on viewability. Maintain visibility and control over inventory : Inventory that was tagged for media type had bot percentages that were well below the average bot percentage of the DCN group. Limit the use of retargeting: The top volume publishers, who did not retarget site visitors, had an average sophisticated bot percentage of 1.79 percent, compared to the higher sophisticated bot average of 2.68 percent for similar publishers who retarget site visitors. *Source: comScore, Inc.®, January 2015 Follow White Ops: White Ops on Twitter White Ops on LinkedIn White Ops on YouTube About Digital Content Next Digital Content Next (DCN) is the only trade organization dedicated to serving the unique and diverse needs of high-quality digital content companies that manage trusted, direct relationships with consumers and marketers.

359,"New York City officials have ruled a recent fire in the city to be accidental, although it tragically resulted in one fatality. The blaze occurred on Thursday at a three-story residential building on East 93rd Street in Manhattan. According to the New York City Fire Department, the fire started in a first-floor apartment and quickly spread to the upper floors of the building. Although the firefighters were quickly on the scene, one individual remained trapped on the third floor and was unable to evacuate in time. The victim was pronounced dead at the scene. Investigators have determined that the fire was accidental, caused by an electrical malfunction in a power strip that was located in the first-floor apartment. While the exact cause of the malfunction remains under investigation, it appears that the power strip was overloaded with too many devices, leading to overheating and ignition. “This tragic incident underscores the importance of using electrical devices safely and according to instructions,” said FDNY Commissioner Daniel Nigro in a statement. “We urge all New Yorkers to take care when using power strips and other electrical devices in their homes, and to always follow the manufacturer’s recommendations.” The blaze was brought under control within an hour, thanks to the quick response of the fire department. Nevertheless, the death of one individual is a tragic reminder of the dangers that can arise from electrical malfunctions in the home.","A fire in York City that claimed the lives of a senior couple on Sunday was caused by an electrical fault and has been ruled accidental, authorities said. The early afternoon blaze started in the front room of the home in the 700 block of Tioga Street, where numerous electronics were plugged into a power strip, said David Michaels, the city fire chief. It's unknown whether the fire started at the power strip or the receptacle into which it was plugged, he said. Firefighters found Anthony and Connie Zorbaugh, 66 and 63 respectively, in the kitchen of their home after responding to a structure fire just after noon, according to the York County Coroner's Office. Michaels said firefighters entered the house in search of the couple and, after finding them, brought them outside and attempted to resuscitate them. But their efforts were unsuccessful. The Zorbaughs died of smoke inhalation and burns, the coroner's office announced on Monday. Michaels said Anthony Zorbaugh had ""significant health issues"" and had trouble moving around. It appeared that Connie Zorbuagh had been trying to help him get out, the chief said. The house is not a total loss, but damage is estimated at $45,000, the chief said. — Reach Greg Gross at ggross@yorkdispatch.com . ——— ©2015 The York Dispatch (York, Pa.)

361,"The mystery behind the thunderous noise that woke up residents across Manchester has finally been revealed, and it may come as a surprise to many. Many residents were left puzzled after hearing a loud, booming noise that seemed to come from the skies above the city in the early hours of the morning. Some even took to social media to share their experiences and speculate on just what the noise could have been. But now it seems that the mystery may have been solved. Sources close to the matter have indicated that none other than Professor Brian Cox, the well-known physicist and TV presenter, may have been the culprit behind the noise. According to these sources, Professor Cox was given the opportunity to fly in a fighter jet over the skies of Manchester in order to film an upcoming documentary series. It is said that the noise may have been caused by the sonic boom that is produced when a fighter jet breaks the sound barrier. When approached for comment, Professor Cox neither confirmed nor denied his involvement in the incident, but did remark that the sound of jets breaking the sound barrier was ""an incredible thing to experience."" Many residents have expressed their surprise at the news, with some calling it a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" opportunity for the popular physicist. However, others have criticized Professor Cox for being a bad neighbor and causing a disturbance that woke them up in the middle of the night. Regardless of the opinions of those who were affected by the noise, it seems that Professor Cox may have unintentionally given Manchester residents a night they will never forget. The incident has sparked a lively debate on social media, with many praising the physicist for his adventurous spirit and willingness to push the boundaries of science. Whatever the opinions may be, it can be said that Professor Cox has certainly succeeded in making headlines once again. His science communication is as fascinating as it is compelling and this latest stunt is only one in a long line of examples where he demonstrates his dedication to bringing science to the forefront of public consciousness. So while the mystery of the Manchester noise may be solved, its legacy lives on. Whether it will lead to further scientific exploration or simply be remembered as a strange occurrence, it is undeniable that Professor Brian Cox has once again captured the attention of the public.","The mystery of the booming noise above Manchester appears to have been solved... after TV scientist Brian Cox confessed to a jet fighter joyride in the skies above. Hundreds of residents in Greater Manchester reported hearing a ‘loud, pulsating’ sound in the sky on Wednesday night - with theories ranging from lightening storms to UFO invasions. But physicist and broadcaster Brian Cox has provided perhaps the most plausible explanation after posting an online apology for making a racket at 30,000ft. This afternoon, the Manchester University professor Tweeted his 1.6m followers: “Thanks @BAESystemsAir for a hell of a ride last night, and apologies to the North West of England for noise.” Accompanying his post was a picture of the former D:Ream keyboardist wearing a pilot’s jumpsuit and posing beside a Eurofighter Typhooon. Thanks @BAESystemsAir for a hell of a ride last night, and apologies to the North West of England for the noise. pic.twitter.com/Pbm5GW34x9 — Brian Cox (@ProfBrianCox) September 17, 2015 Hundreds of people had reported hearing the sound, also described as a pulsating bass, with some stunned listeners saying the rhythmic pulsing seemed to ‘move’ too. It is not yet known whether the University of Manchester professor’s ride on the £70m aircraft which has a top speed of 1,320pm - twice the speed of sound - was for the filming of a new show. The defence manufacturer BAE has bases in Preston and Blackburn. But his revelation provides perhaps the most likely explanation for the phenomenon’s source. However, his apology hasn’t stopped dozens of people getting in touch with the M.E.N to offer their own explanations. Many people suggested that the noise could have being made by a Russian Antonov An-12 cargo plane which flew over Manchester at around 11pm. RELATED: One, @sambop21, tweeted: “it was an Antonov plane out of Birmingham, which climbed over Manchester heading north. They’re very loud.” But others said they had heard the noise many times over the last few months and a vast amount of others came up with a few more fantastical conclusions as to what was responsible for the racket. Michael Wright, alongside a number of alien emojis, said: “It’s aliens bro! ALIENS!!!!!!” Kervin Becinal said: “It was United fans still crying from Luke Shaw’s injury. Get well soon lad!” While Joe Wood added: “My guess is, with it being Freshers week for a lot of students, all the music in the nightclubs synced for a short period of time, meaning that the pulse of the beat was amplified.”"

365,"Biloxi Shuckers shortstop, Orlando Arcia, is not slowing down as the team reaches the finals of the Southern League playoffs. The 21-year-old prospect has been a crucial piece of the Shuckers' success all season long, and he is determined to continue his strong play in the championship series. Arcia, who is rated as the Brewers' No. 1 prospect according to MLB Pipeline, has put up impressive numbers in 2015. He hit .307 with eight home runs, 53 RBIs, 25 stolen bases, and a .347 on-base percentage in 117 games during the regular season. He also showed off his defensive skills, committing only 14 errors and posting a .970 fielding percentage. But Arcia has really elevated his game in the postseason. He is hitting .318 with two doubles, one triple, and five RBIs through seven playoff games. He has also made several key defensive plays, showing why he is considered one of the best defensive shortstops in the Minor Leagues. ""It's just a matter of staying focused and sticking to my approach,"" Arcia said. ""I try not to do too much, just let the game come to me and have fun."" Arcia's attitude and work ethic have impressed both his coaches and teammates. Shuckers manager, Carlos Subero, praises Arcia for his consistency and leadership. ""He is a humble kid who leads by example,"" Subero said. ""He has earned the respect of his teammates by the way he carries himself on and off the field."" Arcia's success is not surprising given his pedigree. He comes from a baseball family - his older brother, Oswaldo, plays for the Minnesota Twins, and his uncle, Alvaro, played in the Major Leagues for 14 seasons. But Arcia is carving out his own path and creating his own legacy. ""I'm proud of my family and their accomplishments, but I want to make a name for myself,"" Arcia said. ""I want to be known as Orlando Arcia, not just the brother or nephew of some other player."" The Shuckers will need Arcia to continue his hot streak if they hope to win the championship. They will face off against the Chattanooga Lookouts in a best-of-five series beginning on Wednesday. The Lookouts boast a strong pitching staff, but Arcia is confident in his team's ability to handle them. ""Everyone on this team is capable of making big plays,"" he said. ""We just have to stay focused and play our game."" The Shuckers have had an incredible inaugural season; they finished with a 78-59 record, clinched a playoff spot in early August and won the Southern League South Division. But they are not content with just making it to the finals. ""We want to win it all,"" Arcia said. ""We've worked too hard to get here to come up short."" The Shuckers are not slowing down, and neither is Arcia. His talent, leadership, and work ethic have been instrumental in the team's success, and he will be a key factor in their quest for a championship.","If the Brewers' top prospect had a huge 2015 season, his postseason can be considered absolutely enormous. ""Orlando Arcia keeps on doing it,"" Double-A Biloxi manager Carlos Subero said. ""He's a special player. With Orlando, the big thing is, the higher the challenge is, the higher he's going to go in the game."" Arcia homered for a third consecutive playoff game, going 2-for-3 with three RBIs and a walk in the Shuckers' 7-1 win over visiting the Chattanooga Lookouts. The victory gave Biloxi a 1-0 lead in the best-of-5 Southern League Championship Series. The 21-year-old shortstop, who slashed .307/.347/.453 with 52 extra-base hits and 25 stolen bases over 129 Double-A games this year, socked a two-run dinger to left-center field off Chattanooga starter D.J Baxendale in the third inning. ""Like the previous two, you could tell he got a good pitch to hit,"" Subero said. ""They got him to break his bat [on a first-inning popout], but he made the adjustments and came back and was ready for them."" He singled in a run against Baxendale in the fifth, giving MLB.com's No. 12 overall prospect multiple hits in all of the Shuckers' four playoff games this year. He's 10-for-16 (.625) with 10 RBIs and six runs scored since the semifinals against Pensacola opened on Sept. 10. ""He had big at-bats. He gets it done when it counts,"" said Arcia's manager. ""That's the kind of player he's been all year. He's been hitting around .370, .380 with runners in scoring position all year. He likes the moment. ""He [homered on] a fastball in, and he thought they were going to start him with the offspeed. He's always thinking along with the game, looking for sequences. It's not only his talent, it's that he puts himself in a position to succeed. Sure enough, first pitch, they give him a curveball, and -- boop! -- up the middle. That tells you something."" Milwaukee's No. 2 prospect Brett Phillips, who was acquired by the Brewers from the Astros in the Carlos Gomez deadline deal , hit his first home run of the postseason after missing the last two weeks of the regular season with an irritated nerve in his thumb. ""It's been great,"" being able to slot him in the lineup, Subero said. ""He got hurt there for a while and only got to play in two games in Pensacola. We all know about his tools -- he covers a lot of ground in center field, and he's been good. It was good to see him hit that one."" The club's No. 9 prospect Jorge Lopez allowed a run on four hits and a walk while striking out six over seven innings to improve to 2-0 with an 0.66 ERA in the playoffs. He finished the regular season 12-5 with a 2.26 ERA over 24 starts spanning 143 1/3 Southern League innings. ""With Jorge, he became a pitcher. He knows how to pitch. He knows what he's got that night. It might not be the changeup, it might not be the curveball, it might not be the fastball early on, but he knows how to work with what he's got,"" Subero said. ""He started that about two-and-a-half months ago, and he hasn't stopped. [Pitching coach] Chris [Hook] has done a tremendous job working with him.""

The fire started on Friday afternoon, and officials are still investigating the cause of the blaze. According to reports, the wildfire quickly spread due to high winds in the area. Over 100 firefighters, from various local and state agencies, were reportedly dispatched to the scene to combat the flames. Residents in the area have been advised to stay alert and be prepared in case of evacuation orders. Despite the efforts of responders, the fire continues to burn as of this writing. As the fire rages on, concerns are growing over the environmental impact of the blaze. Wildlife in the area have been displaced, and officials are urging residents to be cautious when outdoors. The wildfire is just one of many currently burning in the western United States. Across the region, high temperatures and drought conditions have created ideal conditions for the spread of wildfires. Officials are reiterating the importance of practicing caution during outdoor activities and report any potential wildfire activity as soon as possible. The investigation into the cause of the northwest Nebraska wildfire is ongoing, and officials are asking anyone with information to come forward.","A wind-driven wildfire in northwest Nebraska burned nearly 1,800 acres of grassland Tuesday.

369,"Actor Robert Hughes, best known for his role in the television series Hey Dad!, has become the subject of ""poisonous and vile"" social media comments, according to an appeal made by his daughters. The appeal was published on Tuesday in various Australian newspapers. Hughes has been serving a prison sentence since 2014, after being found guilty of sexually assaulting four girls between 1985 and 1990. The appeal made by his daughters, Jessica and Samantha, stated that while they did not condone their father's actions, they felt that the ""constant barrage of hatred"" towards him on social media was unfair and unjust. The appeal, which was addressed to ""those who feel the need to publicly denigrate our father"", went on to say that while Hughes had been found guilty and was serving his sentence, the comments on social media were having a further impact on his family. It added that the negative comments towards Hughes were not only affecting his daughters and other family members, but also the wider community. The appeal also highlighted the fact that social media companies had a responsibility to monitor and remove comments that were considered abusive or defamatory. It stated that while individuals had the right to express their opinions, this should not extend to ""vitriolic and hateful"" comments directed towards Hughes and his family. Hughes' case was one of several high-profile cases that led to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. The commission found that there had been a ""disturbing number"" of cases where institutions had failed to protect children from sexual abuse, and made a number of recommendations for change. The appeal by Hughes' daughters has sparked debate on social media, with some expressing sympathy for the family, while others argued that Hughes deserved the negative comments he was receiving. Social media has become an increasingly powerful tool for individuals to express their opinions and to hold those in positions of power accountable. However, the case of Robert Hughes highlights some of the challenges associated with this form of public discourse. While individuals may feel passionately about a particular issue, it is important that they consider the impact that their comments may have on others. The case of Robert Hughes serves as a reminder of the need to approach sensitive issues with care and respect, and to consider the wider implications of our actions and words.","The trial of former Hey Dad! star Robert Hughes was not fair because he was the subject of ""poisonous and vile"" social media posts, the NSW appeals court has heard. The trial of former Hey Dad! star Robert Hughes was not fair because he was the subject of ""poisonous and vile"" social media posts, the NSW appeals court has heard. Hughes is appealing against his conviction and sentence for sexual and indecent assaults on young girls in the 1980s, arguing his trial was a miscarriage of justice. NSW District Court Judge Peter Zahra sentenced Hughes to a non-parole period of six years, with a maximum term of 10 years, after a jury found him guilty in April last year. Hughes' barrister, Phillip Boulten, SC, told the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal on Monday that the trial miscarried in part because of pre-trial publicity and commentary on social media. ""This was a case where there was ... poisonous vilification of [Hughes] not by mainstream media, but by very persuasive social media that involved the most poisonous and vile publicity from which no one could ever recover. ""There was a deliberate attempt made by people on social media to poison the well. A lot of the material that was published [was] deliberately contemptuous."" Mr Boulten said there were social media posts about Hughes, which received ""millions and millions of views"". Many of the posts were designed to vilify the actor, and did so, the barrister said. Justice Margaret Beazley, the president of the NSW Court of Appeal, queried whether the court should consider social media posts and mainstream media coverage separately. ""The mainstream media coverage was comprehensive ... that might be one thing that's not unusual. ""Social media is another thing. I think we need to look at it separately at least in the first instance. ""You're going to have to show how social media impacted on the trial. ""One [form of coverage] was likely to trigger the other. Apart from that, I don't know if there was any connection."" Mr Boulten also gave a detailed history about one of the complainants in the Hughes trial giving paid media interviews in 2010. The court heard the woman and another prosecution witness gave interviews to Channel Nine's A Current Affair and to Woman's Day magazine, in a publicity deal organised by agent Steve Moriarty. ""[The woman] signed a one-year publicity agreement with him and she was involved in a number of interviews where she received a payment and he received a commission,"" Mr Boulten said. Hughes, who is in Goulburn jail, did not appear in court for his appeal, and did not wish to be on audio-visual link. The appeal continues before Justice Beazley, Justice Monika Schmidt and Justice Richard Button. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald."

371,"The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has ordered the removal of four cigarette products from the market citing a failure by the manufacturer to comply with relevant regulations. Imperial Brands’ Winston, Maverick, Kool, and Salem brand products have been pulled from the shelves following what the FDA said was evidence of non-compliance with its “additive-free” label claims. The agency has flagged concerns around the risk of addiction posed by the four products, and instructed their removal from the market period. “There is evidence to suggest that the tobacco products named in this order present a greater risk of addiction than other cigarettes, and that they were marketed under false pretenses as to their relative safety,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless. According to the FDA, the manufacturer failed to demonstrate that the products were, in fact, additive-free, and misled consumers by branding them as such. The decision comes following a review of Imperial Brands’ marketing submissions, and is part of the FDA’s ongoing mission to reduce tobacco-related harm and prevent youth access to tobacco products. The products will not be allowed to be sold in the US until the FDA can verify they are in compliance with regulatory practices. “Today’s action underscores the FDA’s commitment to targeting products that place consumers at risk, and deprives tobacco companies of the ability to market harmful products as though they are safe,” added Sharpless.","For the first time, the Food and Drug Administration has ordered a major tobacco company to stop selling brands of cigarettes. The FDA on Tuesday ordered the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company to stop selling for brands: Camel Bold Crush, Vantage Tech 13 and the regular and menthol versions of Pall Mall Deep Set Recessed Filter cigarettes. The FDA has ordered other cigarettes off the market before, but those actions involved much smaller companies selling much less popular cigarettes. The agency says it took the action because R.J. Reynolds had failed to prove the brands were no more dangerous than brands that have been on the market longer. ""These decisions were based on a rigorous, science-based review designed to protect the public from the harms caused by tobacco use,"" Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, said in a statement. ""The agency will continue to review product submissions and exercise it's legal authority and consumer protection duty to remove products from the market when they fail to meet the public health bar set forth under law."" Congress gave the FDA authority to regulate cigarettes for the first time in 2009. Among the agency's new powers are the authority to require new brands to prove they pose no more risks to smokers than cigarettes that were put on the market before Feb. 15, 2007. The FDA says R.J. Reynolds had failed to show the four brands that have been ordered off the market do not expose smokers to more harmful chemicals, higher levels of menthol or new ingredients. R.J. Reynolds didn't immediately respond to a request to comment."

376,"In response to growing concerns about public safety, the Wilmington Mounted Police have been deployed downtown to ease fears and maintain order. With the rise in crime rates in Wilmington, Delaware, the mounted police unit has become a valuable asset to the city's law enforcement efforts. The horses provide an added sense of presence and have been known to deter criminal activity simply by their presence. Lt. Adam Brams, commanding officer of the Wilmington Mounted Unit, explained that the mounted police serve a unique purpose in the city's public safety efforts. ""The horses are excellent for crowd control, for getting into tight spaces and for reaching areas where patrol cars cannot,"" he said. ""Their height and presence provide an authoritative presence that can often calm situations down before they escalate."" The mounted police are also more approachable and visible to members of the public, which can help foster positive relationships between law enforcement and community members. Delaware Online spoke with local residents who expressed relief and gratitude at the sight of the mounted police patrolling their neighborhoods. Kathy Rose, a downtown business owner, said, ""I feel safer when I see the horses around. It's nice to know that they're out there, keeping an eye on things and making sure everyone is safe."" The Wilmington Police Department has been working to address the recent surge in crime with a variety of strategies, including increased patrols, community outreach efforts, and partnerships with other law enforcement agencies. The deployment of the mounted police unit is just one of many tactics being used to keep the city safe. According to a press release from the Wilmington Police Department, there has been a 10% reduction in overall crime in the city since the start of the mounted police deployment. While it is impossible to attribute the entire decrease in crime to the mounted police unit, Lt. Brams believes that the horses have played a significant role in the city's public safety efforts. ""We've seen a decrease in crime, but we've also seen an increase in community engagement and positive interactions with law enforcement,"" he said. ""I think the mounted police have helped to foster a sense of safety and security in the community."" The Wilmington Mounted Unit currently has six horses and six officers who are specially trained to handle the animals. The horses are well-cared-for and receive regular veterinary checkups and training sessions. Lt. Brams emphasizes that the horses are not just tools for law enforcement, but are also members of the team. ""We take great care in selecting our horses and in training them to work alongside our officers,"" he said. ""They are part of our family and we treat them as such."" The Wilmington Mounted Unit has been in operation for over 20 years and has become a beloved fixture in the city. The horses and officers are frequently seen at community events and enjoy interacting with members of the public. The mounted police provide a unique and effective approach to public safety that has been well-received by the Wilmington community. Their presence has instilled a sense of safety and reassurance in residents and has helped to reduce crime in the city. As the Wilmington Police Department continues to address crime rates in the city, the mounted police will likely remain an important part of their public safety efforts.","Members of the New Castle County mounted police force patrol around Rodney Square on Friday morning.

Setting said the county has also launched a mobile patrol unit in Wilmington to bolster the efforts of the city department, but residents and those who were walking around the area on their lunch break seemed drawn to the mounted patrol, coming up to pet the large Clydesdales and snap a photo. “For the kids it is just fun,” said Sheila Carn, whose sons Javier and Ezekiel stood in awe looking up at the horses. While her children took in the spectacle, Adam Young, who recently moved to the Residences at Rodney from Philadelphia, said the stabbing just around the corner is disconcerting. He said the slaying was a random act that could have happened anywhere, but the fact that it happened around the corner is shocking. “You don’t expect that to happen,” said Young, who added he thinks the area is a little dangerous. “Even during the daytime I wouldn’t walk terribly far.” Aaron Stansell, a kitchen managers at Ernest and Scott Taproom, flagged down police after the alleged assailant, Calvin Hooker III, walked by the restaurant. “I know Wilmington is dangerous,” said Stansell, who was recently robbed at gunpoint near 8th and Orange streets while walking to his car after work one night. “They just walked up to me and put a gun to my head,” Stansell said. The robbers got away with $40 and Stansell’s cell phone. “I think people pretty much know that it’s dangerous and so they don’t live here or come here,” he said. Stansell said he only continues to work here because it is good money. Sheila Carn, who lives in Riverside, said the increased police presence is about safety. “I think it is good because we need more cops,” Carn said. While she has her own concerns about her neighborhood, Carn said it is also needed in Rodney Square where people congregate and loiter for hours. “This is a big population for drugs. People sleep here,” Carn said, admitting she doesn’t take the bus alone at night and tries to leave work before it gets too dark. In addition to the stabbing on Monday, a man was shot in the chest on the 800 block of N. West Street in January inside an apartment. The area around Rodney Square typically sees crime like thefts from buildings and robberies, according to city crime data. For Haley Peoples and Amy Riddell, who work in the Nemours Building, the presence of police and the mounted patrol are a relief. The women said while they have never been the victims of violence, they know co-workers who have, some having their cell phones stolen as they walked to their cars. “Just seeing the mounted patrol and knowing that they are there makes you feel better,” Riddell said. “And I know is that someone is watching my back.” Peoples said the violence has made her think twice about working in downtown Wilmington, but hasn’t been enough of a problem to make her leave. “I have a family to look out for,” Peoples said. Paige Mikstas, who also works downtown, said she feels unsafe walking and crime is definitely one of the factors keeping her from moving into Wilmington. “I have friends who live on Market Street and sometimes will stay after work,” Mikstas said. “I think if they don’t live close by, people try to avoid the area after, like, 7 p.m. or 8 p.m.” Mikstas said she is uncomfortable walking around in the city after dark. “You just have to take the general precautions like don’t walk around alone, walk fast,” Mikstas said. “My dad always told me to look pissed off when walking alone and feeling uncomfortable, because then no one will bother you.” Downtown Visions, a public-private organization aimed at improving the downtown, offers safety escorts for employees walking to their vehicles or to public transportation, to help ease any fears, said Marty Hageman, the organization’s executive director. Between July 2014 and June 2015, the “safety ambassadors” were called to 4,556 safety escorts, Hageman said. “The number of requests tends to decrease when it is warmer out and increase in the winter, when the sun sets earlier,” he said. WSFS bank, which employs about 275 people in Wilmington, said they often share safety tips with employees, including encouraging them to use the safety escort services offered by Downtown Visions, said spokeswoman Cortney Klein. The Delaware College of Art and Design does the same with students moving into dorms in the Wilmington Campus and provides information for the safety escort program to them. “We carry security guards in our buildings and in our residence halls and we have key cards and video monitoring,” said Jason Mokar, director of student services at the school. Mokar said the school has never had any issue with violence or safety concerns, but takes precautions like on any college campus. The call for an increased police presence was heard loud and clear from the business community earlier this year as some threatened to consider relocating from downtown. Wilmington Police Chief Bobby Cummings said his department has worked to increase the presence in the central business district, and the help of New Castle County Police will boost the patrol numbers there. Wilmington Mayor Dennis P. Williams echoed Cummings, saying the city cannot afford to lose businesses, so there must be a sustained law enforcement effort downtown and there must be an effort to address the homeless who gather as well as those who suffer from drug addiction or mental illness. That effort by police hasn’t gone unnoticed by businesses, said Richard Heffron, the head of the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce. “I know they are trying,” said Heffron. Mac Nagaswami, CEO of Carvertise, located in the Hercules Building at 1313 N. Market Street, said he and his employees haven’t ever had a problem with crime and feel comfortable walking around downtown. “The reality is here in downtown there is such a large visual presence so everybody feels safe,” Nagaswami said. But for residents who live in the area, crime is a persistent and serious concern. Ben Cohen, president of the Midtown Brandywine Neighbors Association, said his group has reached out to police asking for additional patrols and surveillance. “I think we are pretty concerned about crime,” Cohen said, adding that one of his neighbors was held at gunpoint a few weeks ago, but escaped unharmed. “There is a concern about public safety in the city at the moment.” Mike Hare, senior vice president for Buccini/Pollin, a development group that has several apartment buildings in downtown Wilmington, including on Rodney Square, said the company polls its residents about living downtown and safety has not been a top issue for most. “People who choose to live downtown are used to more mess than most,” Hare said, adding that any kind of violence is unacceptable and a concern for those who work and live in the area. “I think some people are shaken by the incident this week,” Hare said. “As long as these incidents don’t continue and there is an appropriate police response it will be OK. We remain advocates as a company for improved public safety deployment in the city and have long been advocating for mounted patrols to come back, but our goal is to eliminate the concern.” Cohen, whose neighborhood is just a few blocks from Rodney Square said he is encouraged seeing more and more officers on the street. “I believe they are doing the best they can,” he said. Brian Lofink, who lives in the Midtown Brandywine neighborhood and works downtown, said right now things seem pretty safe, but if crime continues to increase and move toward his neighborhood, it could be a reason to think about moving out. “I could see it becoming an issue at some point,” he said.

378,"Coronation Street's Callum Logan has emerged as the 'favourite' character to be killed off during the upcoming live episode of the popular soap. The episode, titled 'Live from the Street', is set to air on September 23rd and promises to be one of the biggest events in the show's history. With millions of viewers tuning in, the stakes are incredibly high, and fans have been speculating about who will meet their demise. According to bookmakers, Callum Logan, played by actor Sean Ward, is currently the favourite to be killed off. The character has been at the centre of a number of high-profile storylines in recent months, including his involvement in the disappearance of Kylie Platt and his ongoing feud with the Platt family. If Callum does meet his maker, it will come as a shock to many fans, who have grown to love the character's complex, villainous personality. However, it would also be a fitting end to his story arc, which has seen him spiral out of control in recent weeks. Of course, speculation around which character will be killed off is nothing new for Coronation Street viewers. The show has a long history of shocking deaths, including the iconic tram crash in 2010, which claimed the lives of several beloved characters. With the live episode fast approaching, the tension is mounting in Weatherfield, and fans are eagerly awaiting the fateful moment. Will it be Callum Logan who meets his end, or will another character be unexpectedly killed off? Regardless of who ultimately bites the dust, the live episode promises to be a thrilling and emotional event for Coronation Street viewers. The cast and crew have been working tirelessly to ensure that everything runs smoothly, and with the support of millions of loyal fans, it's sure to be a night to remember. So, as the countdown to 'Live from the Street' continues, the question on everybody's lips is: who will survive, and who will meet their end? Only time will tell, but one thing's for certain - it's going to be one hell of a ride.","Will criminal Callum Logan survive Coronation Street's highly anticipated hour-long live special episode which goes out tonight? Bookmaker William Hill has made the character, played by Sean Ward, the favourite to be killed off with odds of 1/8 on this outcome. The Coronation Street live episode is part of ITV's 60th birthday celebrations (ITV/PA) ""Around 80% think Callum will be killed off tonight, but there is every chance that the current storyline is a double bluff,"" William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams said. T he Platt family are taking centre stage and the odds on David (Jack P Shepherd) dying are currently a 6/1 shot, while his half-sister Sarah-Louise (Tina O'Brien) and wife Kylie (Paula Lane) are both 8/1 to be bumped off. During the episode, which marks ITV's 60th birthday, the Platts are caught up in a war with violent, manipulative Callum, but Sarah-Louise runs into trouble when she takes him on; what will her ex-boyfriend do in retaliation? This will be producer Stuart Blackburn's swansong as Emmerdale's current producer Kate Oates will soon take over ITV's biggest soap. Blackburn is leaving the role to work on other projects within ITV, but will remain at the helm for the live episode. In the best tradition of Coronation Street, viewers are promised drama, comedy and tears. ""At the heart of all this is going to be the Platts and their ongoing feud between the good guys - and whoever thought David Platt would be one of the good guys? - and Callum,"" Blackburn told the Radio Times. ""It's going to be full of shocks and twists and really will make everything that has come before look like a prologue."" The live episode will also see a big secret revealed as Tim Metcalfe (Joe Duttine) is set to find out about the illicit kiss shared between fiancee Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor) and her ex- husband Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell). The on-air drama will be accompanied by a second screen experience as fans will be able to watch via their laptop, mobile or tablet as the episode is being made on itv.com and Facebook. The stream is hosted by Stephen Mulhern, who is also presenting an after-show called Coronation Street Live: Uncovered on ITV2 at 10pm. By the end of the ITV transmission, one viewer's tweet or Facebook message will be seen on the blackboard in the famous Rovers Return pub. Viewers will also be able to choose the music at the leaving party for Lloyd Mullaney (Craig Charles) and Andrea Beckett (Hayley Tamaddon) in an interactive poll on Facebook and Twitter. Coronation Street cast and crew will be hoping everything goes smoothly and that no-one repeats the mistake of EastEnders star Jo Joyner who, as the BBC soap's Tanya Branning, called Albert Square's Ian Beale ""Adam"", the name of actor Adam Woodyatt during their live episode.

382,"Affectiva, a company specializing in emotion AI, announced that it has been granted a patent that will drive video recommendations based on a viewer's emotional state. The patent, US Patent No. 10,561,825, titled ""Systems and methods for emotion-based video recommendations,"" describes a system that recommends video content based on the emotions detected from a viewer. Affectiva's emotion AI technology uses computer vision and deep learning algorithms to detect emotions from facial expressions and other physiologic signals. This technology is capable of identifying a wide range of emotions, from happiness and surprise to anger and frustration. The patent highlights the growing importance of emotion-based recommendations in the entertainment industry. According to Affectiva co-founder Rana el Kaliouby, ""We've reached a point where consumers don't just expect content; they expect content that resonates with them emotionally."" The patent will allow Affectiva to provide video recommendations that are tailored to a specific viewer's emotional state. For example, if a viewer is feeling happy, they might be recommended a comedy or a feel-good movie. If they are feeling sad or anxious, they might be recommended a heartwarming drama or a mindfulness video. The system could also potentially be used to help viewers discover new content that they might not have otherwise considered. For example, if a viewer is feeling curious, they might be recommended a documentary or an educational video. ""We believe that emotion AI is going to play a critical role in the future of entertainment,"" said el Kaliouby. ""Our patent is just the beginning of what's possible."" Affectiva's emotion AI technology is already being used by a number of companies in various industries, including automotive, healthcare, and advertising. The technology has the potential to revolutionize the way these industries operate by providing insights into consumers' emotions and preferences. The company's technology has also been used in research studies, such as a recent study on the emotional impact of COVID-19 on healthcare workers. The study used Affectiva's emotion AI technology to analyze the facial expressions of healthcare workers while they watched videos related to COVID-19. The results provided valuable insights into the emotional toll of the pandemic on healthcare workers. As Affectiva continues to expand its reach, its emotion-based video recommendation system could become a key player in the entertainment industry. The system has the potential to not only provide viewers with content that resonates with them emotionally but also to help content creators and distributors better understand their audience's needs and preferences. The future of entertainment is likely to be heavily influenced by AI and other advanced technologies, and Affectiva's emotion-based video recommendation system is just one example of how these technologies are already transforming the industry.","SOURCE Affectiva Latest patent transforms content recommendations with emotion-based personalization BOSTON ""Affectiva is the only company in the world with a patent that recommends media content driven by a person's emotional response. We believe this will not only transform how users engage with content and express their preferences, but will also dramatically improve how content providers make recommendations, now that they can personalize experiences based on emotion,"" said Nick Langeveld The patent for invention number 9,106,958 entitled ""Video Recommendation Based On Affect"" is for software that analyzes a person's emotional reaction to media content and makes recommendations based on that emotional response. Someone could watch a video and, rather than capture a response by clicking on a star or ""thumbs up"" rating, that person's true, moment-by-moment emotional reaction is captured while the video is playing. Then other content is suggested based on the mood that was elicited by the prior viewing. For example, content provided by YouTube™, Netflix™, Hulu™, or other media publishers could be emotionally ranked as they are watched by numerous people. These emotional responses then serve as input to video recommendation engines. This broad patent also covers the application of emotion-based recommendations in games, movies, educational content, and various other media. This invention enables Affectiva to provide the next generation of content feedback, transforming not only how we review, rank and rate digital content, but also how publishers and social platforms will serve up content recommendations. ""We are inundated with videos and other types of digital experiences. The abundance of digital media makes it hard for us to pick from all these choices,"" says Dr. Rana el Kaliouby, co-Founder and Chief Strategy and Science Officer at Affectiva. ""Our emotions are great drivers of interest, and now with Affectiva's technology, we can get recommendations based on our emotional engagement, truly personalizing our digital experiences."" Affectiva has already commercialized some of these capabilities, specifically the ability to measure and analyze at scale a person's emotional response to digital content. In use by over 1,400 brands today, including Unilever™, Mars™, Kellogg's™ and CBS™, Affectiva's emotion algorithms are built on its massive emotion data repository of more than 3.3 million faces analyzed in 75 countries. This new patent expands Affectiva's patent portfolio to include in excess of 50 issued patents and pending applications in the US. The portfolio covers emotion enablement of computing devices, mobile technology, wearables, and the Internet of Things being applied to digital experiences, mobile apps, gaming, consumer and business applications, market research, and the Internet. Affectiva has developed a robust patenting strategy that is managed dynamically and empowers all employees to develop patenting ideas for review. About Affectiva Affectiva, the global leader in emotion analytics and sensing technology, brings emotional intelligence to the digital world. Using optical sensors, such as cameras, Affectiva technology and science map people's facial expressions into emotions, unobtrusively and at scale. Affectiva has amassed the world's largest emotion data repository – 3.3 million faces analyzed from over 75 countries amounting to more than 12 billion emotion data points.

383,"At first glance, you might not notice anything different about Tom Mitchell, a track coach in Chaffee County. He's fit, athletic, and has a competitive edge that drives his team to succeed. But there's one thing that sets Mitchell apart from most coaches – he has hemophilia, a rare genetic disorder that prevents blood from clotting properly. Hemophilia is a condition that affects approximately 1 in every 5,000 males. For those who have it, even a minor blood vessel injury can be life-threatening. But for Mitchell, this has never stopped him from pursuing his passion for running and coaching. ""I was diagnosed with hemophilia when I was just six months old,"" Mitchell explains. ""My parents were told that I would never be able to play contact sports or do anything too strenuous. But I refused to let it hold me back."" Growing up, Mitchell was naturally athletic and found himself drawn to track and field. He trained hard and competed in high school and college, earning several medals and awards. After graduation, he decided to pursue a career in coaching and began working with high school teams. Despite his condition, Mitchell has never let it take center stage in his life. He injects himself daily with factor VIII, a protein that helps his blood to clot, but he doesn't let it slow him down. ""I try not to focus on the negative aspects of my condition,"" Mitchell says. ""Instead, I use it as motivation to push myself harder and be the best coach I can be."" Mitchell's track team has been incredibly successful under his guidance. In the last few years, they've won several championships and set numerous records. Mitchell's coaching style is tough but fair, and he's respected by his athletes for his dedication and passion. ""He's really inspiring,"" says Sarah, one of Mitchell's athletes. ""Knowing that he has hemophilia and still manages to push himself like this – it's amazing. It makes you want to work harder and never give up."" Mitchell's success as a coach is a testament to his resilience and determination. He's proven that with hard work and the right mindset, anything is possible. ""I don't want people to feel sorry for me,"" Mitchell says. ""I want them to see that someone with hemophilia can still achieve great things. It's all about mindset and determination."" As more people learn about Mitchell's story, he hopes to inspire others to pursue their passions and never let anything hold them back. ""I want to show people that anything is possible,"" Mitchell says. ""Whether you have a medical condition, a difficult upbringing, or any other obstacle – you can still achieve your dreams. It's all about believing in yourself and never giving up.""","(BPT) - Staying committed to a personal passion or goal requires motivation, discipline and confidence. All of which are qualities that Collier Kempton possesses. Despite being born with severe hemophilia A, an inherited bleeding disorder, Collier has remained dedicated to pursuing his interest in running and cycling. And along the way he has inspired others to do the same. Affecting approximately 20,000 people in the United States, hemophilia is a rare and life-long condition in which the blood does not clot normally.[1,2] Collier was diagnosed with hemophilia A, the most common form, at a very young age. With the strong support of his family, Collier didn’t let his hemophilia become a game changer. “I never let my condition put me in a box,” explains Collier. “I made sure to live my life and that has set me up for my future.” For Collier, a big part of his life has included competitive cycling. At 18-years-old, he competed in a duathlon, which involved both running and cycling. Now at the age of 24, running and cycling are still a big part of Collier’s life as he juggles working as a mechanic at a bicycle shop and coaching high school track. Most afternoons Collier can be found chasing his students at practice, coaching them to train harder and staying in shape himself. He uses his personal experiences to help inspire and build confidence in his team, as well as others with hemophilia. And to help him control and prevent bleeding while keeping active, Collier works closely with his healthcare team to determine the right treatment plan. He is currently uses XYNTHA® Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant) to help control and prevent bleeding associated with his hemophilia. “I needed a treatment what worked for me and fit into my personal routine,” explains Collier. “For me the XYNTHA Solofuse is easy to use and the travel-ready pack allows me to infuse my treatment where and when I need to.” Collier shares his story with the hemophilia community in an effort to encourage others to go after what they love. “Live the life you want to live and figure out how to do that within the parameters of your disease,” urges Collier. For Collier, this includes taking certain precautions when preparing for physical activity like a long run or cycling. Here are some tips for staying protected and active with hemophilia: * Take an honest assessment of your fitness level. While you may not be ready to go for a long distance run yet, you can still take small steps to reach your personal fitness goal And remember, before starting any exercise program, it is important to talk to your healthcare provider. * Be open with your treatment team about your personal need Discuss the best way to minimize any risk associated with the sport(s) you have chosen and what to do if an injury or bleed occurs. * Confirm with your physician the timing of your treatment in relation to your activity.[3] To learn more about hemophilia you can visit: http://stepsforliving.hemophiliorg/ http://www.hemophiliavillage.com/ www.facebook.com/OurHemophiliaCommunity For more information about XYNTHA and XYNTHA Solofuse, please visit www.xyntha.com . About XYNTHA XYNTHA® Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant) is indicated in adults and children for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency or classic hemophilia) and for the prevention of bleeding during surgery in patients with hemophilia A. XYNTHA does not contain von Willebrand factor and, therefore, is not indicated for von Willebrand's disease. We asked patients to tell us about their experiences on XYNTHA. This is Collier’s story.

385,"Go back to Brunel not the hell of British Rail...by MICHAEL WILLIAMS The history of British rail travel has been a story of highs and lows, of triumphs and tragedies. From the great achievements of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, to the struggles of British Rail in the 1970s and 80s, the journey of the railways has been a rollercoaster ride. For many, the golden age of rail travel was the Victorian era, when Brunel’s engineering feats transformed the landscape of Britain. But for others, the modern era has been a nightmare of delays, cancellations, and overcrowded trains. It is a sad fact that many people in Britain today would rather take their chances on the motorways, than board a train. The reasons for this are many and complex, but it is clear that something has gone badly wrong. The privatisation of the railways in the 1990s was supposed to herald a new era of innovation and efficiency. The reality has been very different. Underinvestment in infrastructure, insufficient regulation, and fragmentation of the network have all contributed to a system that is creaking at the seams. But there is hope. The recent announcement of a government review into the railways has been widely welcomed. If this review is able to identify the key issues and come up with workable solutions, then we may finally be able to turn the tide. One of the key questions that needs to be addressed is whether the railways should be re-nationalised. Many argue that this is the only way to create a truly integrated and efficient system. Others maintain that privatisation has brought in much-needed competition and innovation, and that it would be a mistake to go back to the days of state ownership. It is clear that there are no easy answers, and that a range of measures will need to be implemented if we are to create a rail system that is fit for purpose in the 21st century. These measures could include greater investment in the network, more effective regulation, and closer collaboration between train operators. But whatever the outcome of the government review, it is clear that we need to rediscover the pioneering spirit of Brunel if we are to make our railways great again. Brunel was a visionary who was not afraid to take on seemingly impossible challenges. He created engineering wonders such as the Great Western Railway, the Clifton Suspension Bridge, and the SS Great Britain. He was an innovator who pushed the boundaries of what was possible, and he was a man who understood the importance of putting people first. If we can re-embrace the spirit of Brunel, then we have a real chance to create a railway system that is truly fit for purpose. We need to invest in the network, streamline operations, and focus relentlessly on customer service. We need to create a culture of innovation and collaboration, and we need to ensure that our railways are safe, reliable, and sustainable. In short, we need to go back to Brunel, and to his vision of a railway system that could unite the nation, drive economic growth, and provide a platform for social mobility. Of course, this will not be easy. The challenges facing our railways are significant, and there are many vested interests that will resist change. But if we can summon the courage and determination of Brunel, then we can overcome these obstacles and create a rail system that we can all be proud of. So let us put aside our differences and come together in the spirit of Brunel. Let us work towards a shared vision of a railway system that is fit for purpose in the 21st century. And let us never forget that the railways belong to all of us, and that we have a responsibility to ensure that they serve the needs of the many, not just the interests of the few. If we can do all of this, then we may yet be able to consign the hell of British Rail to the history books, and create a new golden age of rail travel in Britain.","SC stays summons issued to Kejriwal for making inflammatory speech Mumbai News.Net - Tuesday 22nd September, 2015 The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed the summons issued to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal by an Amethi court for allegedly making an inflammatory speech during the 2014 general elections. ...

388,"When it comes to classic cars, few are as iconic as the 1974 Chevy Laguna Type S-3. This vintage vehicle was a true marvel of engineering, boasting a sleek design that was ahead of its time and a powerful engine that made it a force to be reckoned with on the roads. In this installment of Cars We Remember, we're taking a closer look at the 1974 Chevy Laguna Type S-3 and exploring why it remains a beloved classic car to this day. Design One of the most striking things about this car is its distinctive design. The Laguna Type S-3 was part of Chevy's third generation of mid-sized cars, and it was an instant hit with car enthusiasts. Its sleek lines and aerodynamic shape were unlike anything that had come before it, and it was clear that the designers had put a lot of thought into every detail of the car's appearance. From the front of the car, the large chrome bumper and grille give it an aggressive look, while the sloping rear end adds a touch of elegance. Performance But the 1974 Chevy Laguna Type S-3 wasn't just a pretty face - it was also a powerful machine that could really move. Under the hood, it was powered by a 400 cubic inch V8 engine that produced 245 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. This gave the car plenty of get-up-and-go, especially when paired with the optional Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic transmission. With this combination, the Laguna Type S-3 was able to go from 0 to 60 mph in just 7.6 seconds, which was impressive for a car of its era. Features Of course, there's more to a car than just its appearance and performance - it's also important to consider the features it offers. One thing that sets the 1974 Chevy Laguna Type S-3 apart from other classic cars is its interior. The seats are upholstered in a comfortable velour fabric, and there's plenty of legroom for both the driver and passengers. The dashboard is also well-designed, with large gauges that are easy to read and a stylish woodgrain finish. Other notable features include power steering, power brakes, and a rear stabilizer bar for improved handling. Legacy The 1974 Chevy Laguna Type S-3 may have been built more than 40 years ago, but its legacy lives on today. It remains a popular choice among classic car enthusiasts, with many collectors seeking out well-preserved examples to add to their collections. In addition, the car has had a lasting impact on the automotive industry as a whole. Its sleek design and powerful engine were ahead of their time, and they paved the way for the development of other iconic muscle cars of the 1970s and beyond. Even today, many car manufacturers draw inspiration from the Laguna Type S-3 when designing new models. Conclusion It's clear that the 1974 Chevy Laguna Type S-3 is more than just a classic car - it's a piece of automotive history that continues to fascinate and inspire car enthusiasts around the world. From its distinctive design to its impressive performance, this vintage vehicle is a true marvel that will be remembered for years to come. Whether you're a collector, a fan of classic cars, or just someone who appreciates good design and engineering, the 1974 Chevy Laguna Type S-3 is definitely a car worth remembering.","Q: Hi, Greg. First I want to tell you I enjoy your articles on the older cars and your auto experiences. I still have my 1974 Chevy Malibu Laguna Type S-3 that I bought brand new from the Ferrario Chevrolet dealership in Wysox, Pennsylvania, back in 1974. I am hoping you can give me some history on this car and its current value. The car is original with 52,000 miles on it. It has the 350 V-8 engine with an automatic transmission. I need to buy some parts for the car that I can’t seem to find. I need rear bumper filler in white and also rubber bumper guards as they are cracking and falling apart. Thanks very much, Bob Best, Canton, Pennsylvania. A: Bob, thank you very much for your handwritten letter and the kind words. Your Laguna S-3 was produced from 1974 to 1976 on GM’s new Colonnade A-Body platform assembly line, which was also responsible for many of the sibling mid-size Pontiacs, Oldsmobiles and Buicks back then. Your car looks to be an exceptional example of an original 1974 Laguna S-3 where 350, 400 and 454-inch engines still found a home. All engines in 1974 had to adapt to the new smog and unleaded gasoline requirements, effectively lowering compression ratios which resulted in big horsepower losses. Still, your 350 V-8 powered Laguna is quite the attractive car and is one that is getting even rarer for several reasons. First, the 1974 Laguna S-3 was not a big seller that year. Laguna models were expensive as they were sharing much of the interior influences with the Chevy Monte Carlo. This non-robust lack of sales for V-8 and performance cars back then resulted in a new “consumer code” that pointed to small cars and fuel economy. Thus the mid-size Laguna was not a top choice by any means even though its sibling Chevelle Malibu sold well in six-cylinder and smaller V-8 trim. The good news for a car collector is production numbers, or, better yet, lack thereof. Of the 312,265 Chevelle Malibu sedans and coupes produced in 1974, only 15,792 were option E37, specifically the new Laguna S-3 V-8 that carried a base price of $3,723. Additionally, it was the Laguna S-3 that replaced the famed Chevelle SS in the Chevy lineup, offering a sleek new body design and those body colored bumpers you now seek. (See the owner’s photo attached.) The second reason for being a rare collector car is plain old attrition. Many Chevelles and Malibus and all other A Body creations ended up at the scrap yard long before muscle cars became popular in the hobby. Personally, I always felt the Laguna S-3 was a great looking car, and because of its aerodynamic design back then, including the slope nose front end models in 1975 and 1976, the S-3 became the car of choice for many top NASCAR teams thanks to its slipstreaming properties at 200 mph. However, NASCAR was hot off eliminating from competition other aerodynamic cars like the 1970 Plymouth Superbird and the Mercury Talladega models, so after the 1976 season they outlaw the slope nose Laguna from further competition. Page 2 of 2 - Overall, GM’s new Colonnade A Body Platform was not too much different than the previous A Body platforms that dated back in 1962. Further, if you look close at the 1966 to 1972 A-Body cars you’ll find the design may have changed quite a bit but the drivetrain did not, minus the lower compression engines. Still, even in a time of corporate crisis in building new small cars, it was the 1974 to 1976 Laguna that featured upgrades in larger disc brakes and a new coil over spring rear suspension setup instead of the solid rear axle. As for current pricing, I’m sad to say the 1974 to 1976 Laguna S-3 will never be what a Chevelle SS454 is today. Current NADA Classic Car values have a 1974 Laguna Type S-3 with a 350 V-8 in at $7,650 in “high retail” condition, to an “average retail” of $4,140. I personally feel a Laguna S-3 350 is worth a bit more, and perhaps in the coming years it will increase in value due to its low production numbers. The Laguna 454 with a 4-speed? It’s at around $10,000 in NADA “high retail” condition, compared to a 1970 Chevelle SS454 with the LS6 engine that lists for a “high retail” of $159,000 from an original retail of $3,222! Prices like this prove you can’t erase what happened to muscle cars when the gas crisis hit and manufacturers went to unleaded gas, smog/emission controls and low compression engines. It just plain killed the collector value of cars from the mid to late 1970 decade. In ending, to find the parts you need I recommend picking up a copy of Auto Round-Up or Hemmings Motor News that cater to the collector car hobby. There are also hundreds of online businesses that cater to restoration of Chevrolet cars and trucks specifically, so if you have a friend or family member with a computer, check it out, and look at eBay too. Thanks for your letter Bob and take care of that rare Laguna S-3. Greg Zyla writes weekly for More Content Now, BestRide.com and other GateHouse Media publications.

389,"Over 30,000 people in Japan celebrated their 100th birthday this year, marking a significant milestone in the country's aging population. However, the government and the economy are struggling to keep up with the rising demands of the elderly population. Japan is known for its aging population, with one of the highest life expectancies in the world. The country has been grappling with a declining birth rate and increasing longevity, resulting in a rapid rise in the number of people aged 65 and over. This year, the number of people aged 100 or older reached a record high of 36,000, with over 80% of them being women. While this is an impressive accomplishment, it also puts a heavy burden on the government and the economy. Japan's economy is already struggling with a declining workforce and a shortage of younger workers to support the elderly. The country's social welfare system is also facing significant strain, with rising healthcare costs and a higher demand for long-term care services. The government has been implementing various policies to address these issues, including increasing the retirement age, promoting immigration, and investing in robotics and automation to support elderly care services. Despite these efforts, experts warn that the current system may not be sustainable in the long run. They suggest that Japan needs to rethink its approach to healthcare and social welfare, with a focus on prevention rather than treatment. One potential solution is to promote healthier lifestyles and encourage people to stay active and engaged as they age. This could reduce the need for expensive medical treatments and long-term care services. Another approach is to promote intergenerational connections and create opportunities for older adults to contribute to society. This could help reduce social isolation and promote a sense of purpose and fulfillment in later life. In conclusion, while the rising number of centenarians in Japan is certainly a cause for celebration, it also highlights the pressing need for the government and the economy to adapt to the demands of an aging population. By focusing on prevention, healthy aging, and intergenerational connections, Japan can create a sustainable and fulfilling future for all its citizens.","Japan doesn't really believe in ""dying.""At least, not according to conventional timelines.This past year, some 30,000 Japanese people turned 100 years old. That makes Japan the world leader in centenarians, having approximately 61,000, according to the country'sMinistry of Health, Labor, and Welfare.But in a country where longevity is so prized that September 15Seniors Dayis a national holiday in which a silver sake dish is given out to new members of the 100-plus club, it's actually becoming a burden on the nation's economy to live so long. Seniors, though revered, are eating up resourcesat a pace younger generations can't match.Take the September 15 tradition.In 1963, Japan had only 153 centenarians.By 1998, it had 10,000. Today the country puts the totalat 61,568.While the record is no doubt impressive from both a cultural and scientific perspective,the prize pool is becoming cost-prohibitive. In 2014, the awards cost the country approximately $2.1 million. Since the country only seems to be getting older, this year will be the last year Japan gives out the honorary dish, which is valued at roughly $91.Next year's inductees will instead receive a letter congratulating them on the accomplishment.The fall of the sake dish tradition may be Japan's most visible challenge in dealing with its aging population, but it's hardly the largest one.Nationwide, an entire generation of Japanese citizensgoing on two generations, in factare entering retirement age. Of the 127 million people who live there, roughly 25%are over 65. By 2060, that proportion could rise to 40%.WhileBaby Boomers make up a significant portion of the U.S. population,people 65 and older still only make up 13.5% of the overall population.Meanwhile, the generations that are supposed to replace the elderly aren't reproducing. Countries need a ""replacement fertility rate"" of 2.1 births per woman to keep the population from shrinking. Japan's fertility rate is 1.4the resultof women losing interest in Japanese men and the long hours men typically work that precludethem from dating.This dangerous mixture has led some to argue thatJapan is anticipating a ""demographic time bomb.""(Suddenly a sake dish seem less significant.)Japan's older citizens are working later into their sixties than they used to. Eventually, they will lose theability to work, which means the shrinking generations behind them will be left to boost the economy on their own.That doesn't seem to be happening, as Japan's economy has been deflating for decades.So while the silver sake dish may become affordable again years down the line, as a result of smaller populations getting older, the honor tied to the gesture may lose its luster.Join the conversation about this storyNOW WATCH: A Japanese lifestyle guru explains how to organize your home once ' and then never again Click here to read full news.."
390,"England's rugby team have added an extra test match to their autumn schedule against Fiji, a side they have not played since the 2015 World Cup. While this presents a new challenge for Eddie Jones' team, their World Cup schedule has left much to be desired. The Fiji test, taking place on November 21 at Twickenham, provides an opportunity for England to continue building momentum ahead of the Six Nations and ultimately next year's Rugby World Cup in France. The Pacific Islanders pose a physical threat and England can expect a tough encounter. Fiji famously defeated Wales in the 2007 World Cup, demonstrating their ability to mix it with the best on the big stage. England have a strong record against Fiji, with seven victories from as many Tests. However, the Fijians have shown signs of improvement, pushing Wales all the way in last year's Autumn Nations Cup, and with a strong contingent plying their trade in Europe, they are a team on the rise. Jones will be keen to test different combinations and provide opportunities to fringe players given the depth of his squad. The likes of Ollie Lawrence, Jacob Umaga and Alex Mitchell could all be in line for debuts, providing depth and options for the future. Jones will want to have a settled squad by the time the Six Nations rolls around, but there is still room for experimentation, particularly given the lack of international rugby due to Covid-19. The Fiji test comes at a crucial time for England, who will be hoping to build momentum following mixed results in the Autumn Nations Cup. The tournament saw England defeat Georgia and Wales comfortably, before suffering a narrow loss to France in a final that failed to ignite. Jones' side were criticised for their lack of attacking intent, and the addition of the Fiji test may provide an opportunity for England to cut loose and showcase their attacking flair. England's World Cup schedule, however, is a different story. The reigning champions face a tough pool stage, with Argentina, Japan, and a play-off winner all standing in their way. While Jones will relish the challenge, the lack of rest days and short turnaround times pose a major challenge. England will play both Argentina and Japan within the space of four days, before facing a potential play-off winner just five days later. The gruelling schedule is unlikely to be popular with players, and will require smart management from Jones and his coaching staff. While England are expected to progress from their pool with relative ease, the schedule leaves little margin for error. With France and New Zealand looming as potential quarterfinal opponents, getting to the knockout stages unscathed will be no easy feat. England can take solace in the fact that they have a strong and settled squad, with the likes of Owen Farrell, Maro Itoje and Billy Vunipola leading the charge. However, there are still question marks over their ability to perform consistently at the highest level, particularly in attack. The addition of the Fiji test provides a welcome opportunity to experiment and fine-tune ahead of the Six Nations, but England's World Cup schedule is envied by no one. Jones will need to manage his squad smartly, and hope that injury and fatigue do not set in at the worst possible time. For now, England can focus on the Fiji test, and the potential for new players to stake their claim for a place in the squad. The Pacific Islanders will pose a tough test, but England should have enough quality and depth to come away with a victory. Looking further ahead to the World Cup, England cannot afford to take any opponent lightly, but Jones and his team will be confident in their ability to perform on the biggest stage. The schedule may be gruelling, but England will hope that their experience and quality will shine through when it matters most.","Easy groups have their pitfalls – as New Zealand’s past slip-ups have shown – but Stuart Lancaster’s side will face problematic challenges from the very start Pool of death or pool of dearth, which do you fancy? Is it better to be in England’s shoes and emerge from the pool stages of the World Cup battle hardened and ready for the knockout stages or, like Ireland, have a more measured buildup with only the one crunch game to hone match fitness before a quarter-final? I ask because throughout their 24-year wait for a second world crown, New Zealand, almost always the best side in the world when it came to rankings and respect, would frequently bemoan yet another slip-up, blaming the softness of the pool stages that left them a little flabby when it came to meeting the big boys. When you look at some of the cricket scores of old, such as 145-17 against Japan in 1995, you can see what they mean, but set against England’s route this time my guess is that most coaches would prefer not to be facing Fiji first up, followed by Wales and then Australia. From a pool containing four of the top 10 in the current world rankings, something that should never happen, it is probably the most difficult running order, the only easy option, Uruguay, coming probably after the pool has been settled unless point difference settles the group. Right from the start England have problems. If they can see out Fiji’s early onslaught, it could be a 30-point evening for Stuart Lancaster and his team. Fail and it will be a long night in south-west London. The Australia coach, Michael Cheika, said all the right things – World Cups are meant to be hard, we don’t want any gifts from anyone, etc etc – this week when he was asked about Pool A. But – and it’s marginal – I bet he’s happier with his running order. Fiji, five days after the England match, followed by Uruguay at least gives him the chance to mix and match, whereas by the time England arrive, Lancaster’s side will be heading into their third hard shift on the trot. Now compare and contrast with Ireland, northern hemisphere champions, on course for their best World Cup – and that means a semi-final at least – but still a long way short of their best, if the warm-up against England was anything to go by. Not that it matters, because with Canada and Romania and then Italy up first, that’s a pleasant programme to have in place before they meet France at the Millennium Stadium. With Cian Healy being signed off by the Irish medics this week, all Joe Schmidt’s cards seem to be falling into place just at the right time. The prop’s neck injury meant he missed all of Ireland’s warm-up programme and there were fears he would miss the tournament itself, but a couple of games to get back into the swing of the thing is just what the doctor (or coach) would have ordered before that clash in Cardiff in what could be one of the games of the tournament. Philippe Saint-André’s reign as France coach has been less than glorious, but you sense that the final flourish could be the best of it. With a win rate of only a shade over 40% and consistently low ranking in the Six Nations, you might say that won’t be hard, but the two warm-up games against England last month suggested that the long-lost belief of the national side is returning right on time. Remember, France may not have won the cup, but they have reached three finals and have a happy knack of rising to the occasion and even of undermining All Black World Cup campaigns in the northern hemisphere. Not that they are particularly bad in the southern hemisphere either; the 2011 squad, nominally under Marc Lièvremont but really being coached by some of the senior players, raised themselves after some shocking pool performances to beat England and Wales and get to within a fingertip of beating New Zealand in the final of their own tournament. Will it happen again? Well, the first Cardiff quarter-final could easily be a rerun of 2007 when Thierry Dusautoir tackled himself to a standstill and Wayne Barnes endeared himself to the entire All Black nation. The French are a decent outside bet – they certainly have the power as they showed at Twickenham and against England in Paris – but in the end you always wonder whether Fred Michalak is the kind of fly-half who can string three big games together. Finally it’s worth looking at the way the fates have treated Scotland, and you have to say the calendar and the draw have suggested a return to the top eight. Japan and the USA come first, before the might of South Africa, but the crunch comes last in the pool when Vern Cotter’s side and all its new bits have had time to settle in and, being in Newcastle, is conveniently close to the border. Standing in the way of that quarter-final is Samoa, but it’s not the Samoa of 1991 and 1995. The smile seems to be missing. That kind of island challenge comes from Fiji, who beat Samoa in the Pacific Nations Cup last month, and who set the ball rolling at Twickenham."

392,"Byron Scott, the former head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, recently spoke out about his hopes for Kobe Bryant’s legacy. In an interview with ESPN, Scott said, “I want him to go out standing. I want him to be remembered as one of the greatest Lakers of all time.” Bryant, who has spent his entire 20-year NBA career with the Lakers, is set to retire at the end of this season. Many fans and analysts have been reflecting on his impressive career, which includes five NBA championships, two Olympic gold medals, and countless other accolades. Scott, who coached Bryant for three seasons from 2014 to 2016, had high praise for the future Hall of Famer. “He’s one of the smartest players I’ve ever been around,” Scott said. “His basketball IQ is off the charts. And he’s got a desire and a work ethic that’s unmatched.” But Scott also acknowledged that the current Lakers team, which is in the midst of a rebuilding period, has struggled this season. “It’s not the best situation to end your career in,” he said. “But I think he’s handled it with class and dignity.” Despite the team’s struggles, Bryant has still managed to have some memorable performances this season. In his final game against the Golden State Warriors on March 6th, Bryant scored 19 points and hit three 3-pointers in the fourth quarter to help the Lakers mount a comeback. The game ultimately ended in a 118-116 loss for the Lakers, but it was a reminder of the kind of player Bryant has always been: a fierce competitor who never gives up. As Bryant’s retirement approaches, many fans and analysts are left to wonder how he will be remembered. But Scott is confident that Bryant will go out on a high note. “It’s been an honor to be a part of his journey these last few years,” Scott said. “He’s one of the greatest players in NBA history, and he’ll always be a legend in Los Angeles.”","Kobe Bryant’s last three seasons have ended in injuries. Now in his 20th and perhaps final season, the Lakers organization will be taking careful steps to preserve the Mamba’s health . Head coach Bryon Scott has faced criticism for playing Kobe extended minutes last season. In an interview with OC Register , Scott admitted he was wrong and will defer to Kobe about his minutes . Scott says he’ll sit down with Kobe to decide whether the Lakers star should play in back-to-backs. Q. What decisions are you facing with Kobe? A. I think the biggest decision is playing time, trying to make that as limited as possible and also back-to-back games. That’s something we have to talk about. Other than that, there really is no other decision to make. He wants to play, and he wants to go out the way he wants to go out — if this is indeed his final year. He and I have talked a number of times on the phone, we’ve talked about playing time, we’ve talked about back-to-back, we’re going to probably sit down as we get closer to training camp or as we get in training camp and even talk more about it. Because the one thing I want, if this is his last year, I want him to go out standing. I don’t want him to go out hurt. I want to make sure I do everything in my power to make sure we stick to the game plan, as far as his minutes and as far as back-to-back games. Q. What do you mean by as “limited as possible?” A. I didn’t mean play as limited as possible. Obviously we want to keep him as efficient as possible, but I know he knows his body better than anybody. When we start talking about those minutes, I want to listen to him more than anything. I’m not going to go by what I think he can play like I did last year, I want to really go by what he thinks he can play. Then I want to make sure we stick to that.

393,"The historic Pierce School project in Davenport, Iowa is showing some promising progress. The project, which aims to turn the former school building into multifamily housing units, has been in the works for several years. Despite facing a variety of setbacks, the project is finally beginning to gain traction. The development company, High Pointe Development, has announced that the building is now fully gutted and ready for the next phase of construction. According to High Pointe Development, the next step in the project is to install new plumbing, electrical, and mechanical systems throughout the building. This process is expected to take several months. Once the new systems are in place, construction crews can begin work on the individual units within the building. The project is set to include a mix of one, two, and three-bedroom units, as well as community amenities such as a fitness center and community room. The Pierce School building was first constructed in 1916, and has sat vacant for several years. The project to renovate the building has been in the works since 2016, and has faced several challenges along the way. One of the biggest challenges has been securing funding for the renovation. According to High Pointe Development, the project will be funded in part by historic tax credits, as well as various private and public financing sources. In addition to funding challenges, the project has also faced criticism from community members who feel that the building should be preserved as a historical landmark, rather than turned into housing units. Regardless of these challenges, the project is finally beginning to take shape. According to High Pointe Development, the project is on track to be completed by the end of 2022. Once completed, the Pierce School project is expected to provide much-needed housing options for residents of Davenport. The city has faced a shortage of affordable housing in recent years, which has made it difficult for many residents to find suitable housing options. The Pierce School project is just one of several new housing developments planned for the city in the coming years. These projects are expected to help alleviate some of the housing issues facing Davenport, and provide residents with more affordable and accessible housing options. In conclusion, the Pierce School project in Davenport is showing some promising progress. While there have been challenges along the way, the project is finally beginning to gain momentum. With new plumbing, electrical, and mechanical systems set to be installed soon, the project is on track to be completed by the end of 2022, and will provide much-needed housing options for residents of the city.","The work that is being done inside the school-turned-lofts in Davenport’s East Village now is visible from the outside. The old retaining wall on the south side of the Pierce School Lofts is being rebuilt, and the developers are taking extra pains to make sure it complements the historic district. “It was rotted railroad ties and crumbling concrete,” said Tim Baldwin, who is partnering with Pat Sherman to transform the old school. “We’re using manufactured block that is made to look like cut stone. “We’ll apply an acid etch and stain to give it a limestone color.” The project, which is getting $708,000 in housing tax credits through Iowa’s Economic Development Authority, has a total price tag of $8 million to $9 million. When finished next summer, the property at 2212 E. 12th St., will contain 41 housing units. “Everything is getting state and federal approval, because of the tax credits,” Baldwin said Thursday. “We can’t use the credits for the new wall or the parking lot, though.” The Economic Development Authority has a specific list, called Qualified Reimbursable Expenses, for the portions of the project where tax credits can be used. Other rules also apply, and the partners have made changes to the development to make sure they comply. “We really wanted to do a rooftop deck,” Baldwin said of the portion of the school that was added to the historic property in the 1970s. “We thought it would be a beautiful viewing area for the turn on the (Quad-City Times) Bix 7.” But it was not possible to provide access to the roof that would comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, he said. “Instead, we’ve designed the parking-lot layout in a way that creates a space for permanent bench seats with historic features around it,” Baldwin said. When finished, Pierce School Lofts will contain large, primarily one- and two-bedroom apartments. The units will be considerably larger, Baldwin said, than those inside the former Democrat building on Brady Street, which Baldwin and Sherman also rehabbed. The pair recently decided to add a studio unit, because the smaller, less-expensive living options have become increasingly popular in historic makeovers, Baldwin said. “The one bedrooms can go for $900 plus and the two-bedroom units can run from $1,300 to $1,400,” he said. “The lower studio pricing is in demand.” The target date for opening Pierce was June 2016, but the project is ahead of pace. “As it stands now, we’re running a couple months early,” Baldwin said. “We could hit some snags in the winter, but we’re in good shape now. “Everything is framed in, and we’ll be hanging (sheet) rock in the next couple of months, and the electrical, plumbing and HVAC are roughed-in.” Baldwin said he has been “disheartened” by one element of the work: Someone has been shooting a BB gun through some of the windows, which have been, “literally re-handcrafted. “Eventually, the building is going to have a sophisticated security system, but, for now, we’ve asked the police to help us keep an eye on things. “This project is going to clean up the neighborhood so much.”"

397,"Simon Busuttil, former leader of the Nationalist Party (PN), has publicly expressed his support for Francis Zammit Dimech, the party's veteran MP who has recently been faced with calls for his dismissal. In a statement released on Saturday, Busuttil stated that he believed Zammit Dimech's dismissal from the party was unwarranted and that he still had much to contribute to the PN. ""I have known Francis for over 20 years and worked closely with him during my time as PN leader,"" Busuttil said. ""He is a man of integrity and dedication who has served our country and party with distinction."" Busuttil's comments follow the recent controversy surrounding Zammit Dimech, who was accused of attending a private dinner at the home of a controversial businessman. Although the party's executive committee initially called for Zammit Dimech's resignation, he has since refused to step down, stating that he had done nothing wrong and that he had been invited to the dinner in his capacity as a lawyer. Many supporters of the PN have rallied around Zammit Dimech, with some arguing that he has been unfairly targeted by the party's leadership, and that there are more pressing issues for the party to focus on. Busuttil echoed these sentiments in his statement, stating that he believed the party should focus on winning back the trust of the Maltese people, rather than engaging in internal squabbles. ""I urge the party's leadership to reconsider its position on Francis and work together to move the party forward,"" Busuttil said. ""We cannot afford to lose dedicated and talented individuals like Francis, who have so much to offer our country and our party.""","Opposition leader Simon Busuttil said today that no action should be taken by the Nationalist Party against Francis Zammit Dimech, who is among those charged in relation to the death of a worker on the site of the Seabank Hotel in Mellieha. Dr Zammit Dimech was a non-executive director of the hotel at the time. The worker died when a ceiling collapsed. Dr Busuttil issued his statement after the prime minister two Sundays ago asked if action would be taken against the former minister in view of the fact that the PN had demanded the resignation of the justice minister after a traffic accident in which a man was injured and the minister ended up in court. In a statement, Dr Busuttil said: ""I have reached the conclusion that, until the court pronounces its judgement, no action should be taken against Francis Zammit Dimech by the party for the following reasons: ""Dr Zammit Dimech was not involved in what happened in any manner whatsoever. He was a non-Executive Director with no direct or indirect involvement in the running of the company that owns the hotel where building works took place. ""Dr Zammit Dimech does not occupy an executive role in Government. It would have been different if he were a minister. But he is not. There is therefore no role of responsibility to dismiss him from. ""The incident was not even remotely connected with Dr Zammit Dimech’s parliamentary and political duties or even with his past ministerial duties and therefore dismissal from the party is not warranted."" Dr Busuttil said Dr Zammit Dimech ""is showing strength and resolve in this difficult time and I stand four-square behind him."" He said he had communicated his decision to the Parliamentary Group which supported it unanimously."
398,"HSBC Holdings plc, one of the biggest banking and financial services organizations in the world, has been upgraded to ""neutral"" from ""underperform"" by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. This is seen as a significant shift in the perception of HSBC and a notable upgrade in the eyes of investors and analysts alike. The upgrade has been driven by the bank's ""low valuation"" and the ""potential for earnings growth"" within the company, as well as the ""opportunity for capital return"" to shareholders. The move was announced on Tuesday, with HSBC shares trading at £5.58 at the time of writing, up 0.54% from the previous day's close. ""Our analysis suggests that HSBC is poised for an increase in revenues and earnings growth, driven by a combination of rising interest rates, higher loan growth, and a stronger macroeconomic environment,"" said Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Alastair Ryan in a research note to clients. HSBC has undergone significant restructuring in recent years, trimming down its operations, and focusing on core businesses in Asia and the Middle East. The bank has also invested heavily in technology, cutting costs, and improving efficiency by digitizing its operations. These efforts have paid off in terms of cost savings, with HSBC's cost-to-income ratio falling recently to 61.9%, down from 62.7% in the previous year. This puts the company ahead of its target of reducing its cost-to-income ratio to below 68%. HSBC has also been working on improving its financial metrics, with the bank's capital position strengthening in recent years. The bank's common equity Tier 1 ratio (CET1) – a key measure of a bank's ability to withstand losses – stood at 14.2% at the end of the first quarter of 2021, up from 11.6% in 2016. This puts HSBC in a strong position to return capital to shareholders, which is likely to be a key focus in the coming months. ""HSBC's capital position, combined with its strong liquidity profile and robust balance sheet, affords the bank the flexibility to continue to invest in growth opportunities, and return capital to shareholders,"" said Ryan. Overall, the upgrade to ""neutral"" is seen as a positive sign for HSBC and its investors, with the bank expected to benefit from improving market conditions and continued investments in growth opportunities. With a strong capital position and a focus on profitability, HSBC is well-positioned to navigate future challenges and capitalize on opportunities in the years ahead.","Bank of America upgraded shares of HSBC Holdings plc (LON:HSBA) to a neutral rating in a report issued on Thursday, Analyst Ratings.Net reports.

400,"Breast milk is often hailed for its numerous benefits, including providing essential nutrients and antibodies to newborns. However, recent research has discovered another crucial component: the hormone FGF21. According to a study published in the journal Cell Metabolism, FGF21 plays a key role in regulating newborn metabolism. The hormone is present in breast milk and is crucial for the optimal development of newborns. The study, conducted by researchers from the University of California, San Francisco, found that FGF21 regulates the metabolism of certain amino acids and sugars in newborns. It also enhances insulin sensitivity, a critical factor in regulating blood sugar levels. Dr. Stephanie K. E. Holt, lead author of the study, explains, ""We have discovered that FGF21 in breast milk promotes the metabolism of nutrients in the newborn and contributes to the regulation of glucose and insulin sensitivity, which in turn is essential for optimal development."" The study involved analyzing breast milk samples from lactating mothers and observing the effects of FGF21 on mice genetically engineered to lack the hormone. The researchers found that newborn mice without FGF21 had reduced insulin sensitivity and experienced slower growth and development. Interestingly, FGF21 is not only present in breast milk but is also produced by the liver in response to fasting and stress. This suggests that the hormone plays a significant role in regulating metabolism in various physiological contexts. The researchers hope that their findings will lead to new treatments for metabolic disorders in both adults and newborns. Dr. Holt states, ""These findings add to a growing body of evidence that FGF21 plays a central role in regulating metabolism and energy balance, and they suggest that manipulating FGF21 levels could provide a strategy for treating metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes."" The study also underscores the importance of breastfeeding for the optimal development of newborns. Breast milk provides numerous benefits, including essential nutrients and antibodies that boost the immune system. FGF21 is just one of many key components that make breast milk the optimal source of nutrition for newborns. In conclusion, the study's findings highlight the crucial role of FGF21 in regulating newborn metabolism and promoting optimal development. The hormone's presence in breast milk underscores the importance of breastfeeding for providing essential nutrients and promoting healthy growth and development. The study's authors hope that their research will pave the way for new treatments for metabolic disorders in both adults and newborns.","A compound found in breast milk, named fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), plays a key role in neonatal nutrient absorption and intestinal function. FGF21 also contributes to improve newborn growth and metabolic profile. This is the main conclusion of the project “Study of FGF21 as a new factor present in breast milk and involved in the benefits of breastfeeding”, included in the programme of excellent research RecerCaixa, an initiative organised by the Obra Social “la Caixa” together with the Catalan Association of Public Universities (ACUP). The results of the study have been published in the journal Scientific Reports of the Nature Publishing Group by a scientific team led by Francesc Villarroya, professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Barcelona (UB), together with the Biomedical Research Networking Centres on Physiopathology of Obesity and Nutrition (CIBERobn) and the Danone Institute. FGF21 is a hormonal factor produced mainly in the liver. The factor is present in the human body in a natural manner, even if in some people it is more active than in others. To date, it was known that it plays important roles in favouring glucose uptake and energy metabolism, and thus possesses anti-diabetic and anti-obesity properties. The research study led by Dr Villarroya, director of the Institute of Biomedicine of the UB (IBUB), has proved that oral infusion of FGF21 to neonatal gut induces the gene expression of intestinal hormones and increases intestinal lactase activity and lactose absorption. Animal models indicate that metabolic profile and growth is 25% better in neonates who receive the factor than in those who do not receive it. In order to come to this conclusion, researchers analysed the differences between a group of pups nursed with milk containing FGF21 and another group of pups nursed with milk lacking FGF21. In a previous study developed together with the Hospital Sant Joan de Déu, the team led by Dr Villarroya found that FGF21 levels are very low in fetuses, but the blood levels of FGF21 rise dramatically after birth and the initiation of suckling. This fact proves the importance of maternal breast feeding. Further studies will be required to confirm these findings in human neonates. Researchers will analyse the long-term effects that having been exposed to FGF21 has on the metabolism until adolescence, as well as the presence of the factor in formula feeding in order to optimize biotechnological formula designs to fulfil the complexities of optimal milk composition and mimic the properties of breast milk.

404,"As the ride-hailing industry continues to dominate the transportation sector, concerns about a level playing field for traditional taxi services have come to the forefront of the debate. While some argue that regulations should be relaxed to allow for fair competition, others say that the playing field needs to be leveled to give traditional taxis a fighting chance. The issue has been a particularly controversial one in Massachusetts, where Uber and Lyft were granted the right to operate statewide in 2016. At the time, many traditional taxi companies argued that the companies should be subject to the same regulations and fees as they were. However, the state ultimately decided to impose fewer regulations on the ride-hailing companies, arguing that they provided a valuable service to consumers. Since then, some traditional taxi drivers have struggled to compete with Uber and Lyft. In Boston, for example, traditional taxi rides have dropped by more than 20 percent since the arrival of the ride-hailing companies. Some drivers have been forced to sell their medallions - permits that allow them to operate taxis - at a loss, while others have seen their business dry up entirely. Advocates for traditional taxi services say that the playing field needs to be leveled if these companies are to survive. One of the main concerns is the different regulations that apply to taxi companies and ride-hailing services. Traditional taxis are typically subject to extensive regulations, including insurance requirements, vehicle age restrictions, and fare limits. Ride-hailing services, on the other hand, are subject to fewer regulations, which makes it easier for them to operate. Critics argue that this discrepancy gives ride-hailing companies an unfair advantage over traditional taxis. They argue that regulations should be relaxed to allow traditional taxis to compete more effectively. For example, some cities have proposed allowing traditional taxis to set their own fares, which would allow them to undercut ride-hailing companies in price. Proponents of the ride-hailing industry, however, argue that these companies have revolutionized the transportation industry and provided valuable services to consumers. They say that the regulations imposed on traditional taxi services are outdated and unnecessary, and that they should be removed to allow for fair competition. One of the key differences between traditional taxis and ride-hailing services is the way in which they are licensed. In many cities, taxis are licensed by a cap, which limits the number of licenses that are issued. This is intended to prevent congestion and ensure that drivers earn a living wage, but it also limits the number of taxis that are available to consumers. Ride-hailing services, on the other hand, are typically not subject to such caps. This has led to concerns that the growth of these companies could lead to an oversupply of drivers, which would drive down wages for all drivers. Despite these concerns, the ride-hailing industry has continued to grow at an unprecedented rate. In Boston, for example, the number of ride-hailing trips has increased from just over a million in 2012 to more than 41 million in 2018. As the industry continues to grow, it is likely that the debate over a level playing field will continue. For now, the state of Massachusetts has taken steps to address some of the concerns of traditional taxi drivers, including lowering the cost of medallions and maintaining a minimum fare for ride-hailing services. However, it is unclear whether these steps will be enough to level the playing field between the two industries. Ultimately, the future of traditional taxi services may depend on their ability to adapt and compete in a rapidly changing market.","By STATE HOUSE NEWS SERVICE BOSTON -- Uber, Lyft and taxicab drivers showed up by the hundreds at the State House on Tuesday as lawmakers began to consider proposals to regulate the booming ride-hailing industry, including Gov. Charlie Baker's attempt to thread the needle between protecting public safety and encouraging innovation. With the Financial Services Committee preparing to consider four major bills this fall that would regulate so-called transportation network companies like Uber and Lyft, lawmakers are grappling with issues ranging from making sure for-hire cars are adequately insured to ensuring that drivers present no threat to the public. Public Safety Secretary Dan Bennett, testifying first on Tuesday, told members of the committee that Baker's bill would impose ""one of the strongest state level background checks in the country"" among states that have tried to regulate the smartphone-driven industry. The bill (H 3351) proposes a two-part background check for drivers, including a national check done by the company and a comprehensive state check that would include a criminal and sex offender registry check, as well as driving history. ""No other state has adopted this type of belt and suspenders system,"" Bennett said. While Bennett emphasized safety, Assistant Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Entrepreneurship Katie Stebbins said Baker's bill was also ""pro-business, pro-consumer and pro-innovation.Advertisement "" ""Disruption is a hallmark of innovation,"" Stebbins said. The governor's bill, she said, seeks to level the playing field while also avoiding the type of overregulation, like pricing controls, that could stifle growth in the industry. In addition to background checks, Baker's bill would require Uber and Lyft drivers to have a minimum $1 million insurance policy for death, injury and property damage that would kick in only when the driver had their app on, was driving to pick up a customer or had a passenger in the car. It will be up to the companies themselves how much of the insurance costs the drivers will have to shoulder. Because the TNC drivers use their personal vehicles for commercial purposes, the administration said it was important to distinguish between when the car was being used for business and personal use. The hybrid insurance product, which is currently sold by a company in Virginia, exceeds the requirements for taxi drivers, officials said. At least one company has proposed selling a similar type of policy in Massachusetts. Uber and Lyft drivers, wearing blue and pink T-shirts respectively, packed the grandstand of the Gardner Auditorium where the air was thick with humidity. Cab drivers wearing yellow T-shirts filled the lower seating area, and periodic cheers and boos erupted from both groups as lawmakers and the administration discussed the proposals. Uber and other groups, including Associated Industries of Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council, are supporting Baker's bill as opposed to separate legislation filed by Rep. Michael Moran and Sen. Linda Dorcena Forry, both of Boston, that would impose stricter regulations on the ride-hailing services. The Moran-Forry bill (H 3702) would, among other things, require a system of fingerprint background checks that Bennett said would be too ""cumbersome"" to implement. The Moran-Forry bill also encourages some oversight of Uber's ""surge pricing"" system, which charges passengers higher rates at peak hours to encourage more drivers to meet the demand. Baker officials said the state should not interfere with pricing, but rather allow consumers and the market to police itself. Angela O'Connor, chairwoman of the Department of Public Utilities, argued in favor of giving the regulatory oversight to the DPU, which currently regulates other commercial drivers, and said broad regulatory authority would allow the DPU to respond in the future to a rapidly changing industry. The department envisions starting with five new employees to oversee background checks and other functions, and would plan to purchase a database to track permitted drivers. Funding for oversight would come from an assessment on the transportation network companies. As lawmakers probed the rationale for the insurance and background check recommendations, Rep. James Cantwell, a Marshfield Democrat, raised the issue of car markings as he described a constituent who had strangers jump in his car at the airport thinking it was an Uber. Baker's bill does call for cars to be marked, but Bennett did not elaborate on what that would look like. Rep. Shawn Dooley, a Norfolk Republican, also raised a concern about the proposed five-day window for the DPU to perform its background check on new drivers. If the state check is not finished in time, the driver would be provisionally approved to start driving, Bennett said. Dooley said he wanted to see a policy where the driver could be provisionally disapproved if something out of the control of the DPU prevented them from completing the background check. ""I don't care if it's a one-in-a-million chance, I don't want that guy out picking up my daughter from college,"" Dooley said. Before the hearing, taxi drivers from the Greater Boston area congregated outside the State House to make their opinions known. Eugene Larrame, who said he has driven a cab in Cambridge for 33 years, was one of about 15 drivers wearing yellow T-shirts that said ""I'm a cab driver and I vote"" on the back. Larrame said the state allowing ""transportation network companies"" like Uber and Lyft to have free reign is similar to a parent allowing one child to run wild. ""Let's say you have four or five kids. One of them, you let them do whatever they want. What is going to happen, are you going to have a good kid?"" he asked. ""Probably not. It's the same thing happening here."" During a radio interview on WGBH Tuesday, Attorney General Maura Healey outlined her general considerations. ""I think that today's discussion, debate is really important,"" she said. ""Look, this is a new industry, it is part of the new on-demand economy and, you know, as with any new sort of industry it is going to take some time and conversations and dialogue to figure out sort of the best path forward here. I know the Baker administration has put forward legislation and there are a few other bills out there pending. It's a really good discussion."" Healey added, ""First public safety should be protected. We want to make sure that as people use this service or are picked up by Uber or Lyft drivers that their public safety is protected and ensured . . . It speaks to background checks and measures such as that and it also is important that consumers are protected and that's what some of the discussion has been about. But, you know, I welcome the discussion and I'm looking to learn more, it's obviously not an area the attorney general has any direct oversight or regulation of and I think it's important."" Asked by Boston Public Radio host Jim Braude why she couldn't issue ride industry regulation, like she did with e-cigarettes, Healey said, ""This is a power and authority that exists within the Department of Public Utilities actually, a different state agency and I respect that. I respect the work of the Legislature and their efforts to engage in this discussion and debate. Look, it's not just here in Massachusetts, it's a debate, it's a discussion that we've seen nationally and as I said, I'm looking to learn more."" Healey said she's used Uber and Lyft and likes both services. [Colin Young contributed reporting]"

409,"A team of students from a university in China has come up with an innovative idea to make paper using feathers, a waste product from the poultry industry. This ecological paper-making idea is a feather in the cap of the students and has left many in the academic community impressed. The team of students, from Zhejiang University of Science and Technology, was led by Associate Professor Shengyong Yang. They found a way to extract the keratin protein from feathers to create a strong and durable paper. This process not only helps to reduce waste but also has a minimal environmental impact. According to the team, feathers contain a high level of keratin protein which, when processed correctly, can be used to make paper. The team used a series of chemical processes to dissolve the feathers' protein and create a paper pulp that could be used to make sheets of paper. The process has been praised for its ecological benefits, as it takes a waste product and turns it into a valuable resource. According to Professor Yang, the process has the potential to revolutionize the paper-making industry and could help to reduce the amount of waste produced by the poultry industry. The team's project has received several awards and recognition, including the ""Innovation Prize"" at the ""Challenge Cup"" competition, a prestigious national competition for university students. The project has also received support and funding from various organizations, including the National Natural Science Foundation of China. The students are reportedly planning to continue their research into this new type of paper-making and are exploring ways to further improve the process. They hope that their work will help to promote sustainable development and reduce environmental impact. This new ecological paper-making idea is a testament to the innovative and creative spirit of China's youth. By converting waste into a valuable resource, these students are not only making a positive impact on the environment but also contributing to the development of sustainable technology.","Students demonstrate an eco-friendly farm at the 'Solve for Tomorrow' National Youth Scientific Innovation and Experiment contest in Beijing. [Photo/Provided to chinadaily.com.cn] The use of wood pulp for paper making has long been a threat to forest preservation but an innovative idea from Chinese college students might offer a solution. The technology of making paper from processed poultry feathers became a focal point at the regional final of the 2015 ""Solve for Tomorrow"" National Youth Scientific Innovation and Experiment contest for its potential to ease the industry's dependence on forest resources. Developed by a three-student team from Tianjin University of Science and Technology, the innovation was patented as a ""new invention"" by the State Intellectual Property Office in May and was considered a favorite to win the creative segment of this year's contest. ""The idea just came from our curiosity about where all the feathers from chicken consumed in McDonald's and KFCs go. Then we found they could be useful with fibers available for paper making,"" Zhang Rongqi, a junior student in the development team, told China Daily at the China Science and Technology Museum, venue for the contest. Feather-made paper has been produced as decorative wallpaper in a trial, while fiber separated from feathers through the new technology could also be used in air-purifying membrane production, said Ou Huajie , another team member. However, the invention remains far from implementation as it needs further development for mass processing and production, according to the team. The invention was one of 17 new technologies or ideas reaching regional finals of the contest's creative segment, in which students demonstrated their inventions through 20 minutes of presentation, operation and question and answer sessions with the judging panel, which included renowned scholars, officials and notary officers. The contest also includes a challenge segment, which requires students to fulfill three assignments – smart transportation, wind power utilization and security protection – by making use of a limited number of tools and resources."
410,"The Berhampore community is set to benefit from a refurbishment of its local village hall, which will give its residents a boost to their ""neighbourly spirit"". The hall, known as the Berhampore Community Centre, was built in the 1970s and is well-loved by residents who use it for various community events, such as meetings, markets, and performances. However, after decades of use, the hall is in need of a revamp, which is why the Wellington City Council has committed to fund the refurbishment. The project will include a complete overhaul of the hall's interior, including its kitchen and toilets, as well as upgrades to its lighting, heating, and insulation. The hall's exterior will also be updated with new cladding, roofing, and windows. The project is expected to cost $1.5 million and is set to be completed by the end of 2021. ""I'm really excited about this project,"" says Berhampore resident, Jane Smith. ""The community centre is such an important part of our neighbourhood. It's where we come together for events, celebrations, and to support each other. Having a refurbished hall will really boost our sense of community and neighbourly spirit."" The Berhampore Community Centre is located in a lively part of the suburb, surrounded by family homes, coffee shops, and parks. The hall is run by a volunteer committee, which works closely with local residents to organise events and activities that benefit the community. ""The committee members are thrilled about the refurbishment,"" says committee chairperson, John Brown. ""We've been planning for this for several years, and now that it's finally happening, we can't wait to see the results. The new facilities will allow us to expand our programming and offer more activities for people of all ages."" The Wellington City Council says that the refurbishment of the Berhampore Community Centre is part of a wider plan to invest in community facilities across the city. The council recognises the importance of community centres in building stronger neighbourhoods and fostering a sense of belonging for residents. ""We want to invest in our communities and create spaces where people can come together, socialise, and support each other,"" says Councillor Sarah Free, who oversees community facilities for the council. ""The Berhampore Community Centre is a vital part of the Berhampore neighbourhood, and we're proud to support this refurbishment project."" With the project set to be completed by the end of the year, the Berhampore community is looking forward to enjoying its refurbished hall and continuing to build stronger and more connected neighbourhoods.","Residents in Wellington's oldest multi-unit housing block have been calling for a community space for years, and Housing New Zealand has listened. The circular hall in Berhampore's Centennial Flats is being refurbished into a communal space, as it was originally intended during its construction in 1938. Renowned New Zealand architect Gordon Wilson designed the entire modernist-style complex, with the hall intended for community use. The community used it until the 1980s, when it was converted into a three-bedroom flat. Construction on the hall could be completed as early as February 2016. Housing NZ stakeholder relationship manager Renee Martin says the hall will be available for a range of planned activities. ""It could be used as a meeting space, a mobile library, advisory and health services, exercise classes, cooking classes and for adult education purposes,"" she says. A community meeting of about 40 people was held at Berhampore School in August to to discuss ideas for the hall. Cassandra RiversHousing NZ's central region communications manager, says the restoration has been met with a positive response from residents. ""There was a sense of, 'Yay, Berhampore is going to have its own space and people won't have to go to Island Bay or Newtown'."" In 2012 Housing NZ contracted firm Architecture Cubed to design and manage the refurbishment of the entire complex. Architect Giles Alington says the renovations are complicated because of the complex's heritage listing Alington is working to reinstate three French doors at the entrance, which were part of the original design, and he is also trying to find a way to install a ramp for accessibility. ""We are working to come up with a design that doesn't compromise the exterior."" Inside the hall, they will remove the partition walls, then build bathrooms, a kitchen, a quiet space, and an office, he says. Project manager Martin Chastney says the refurbishment was divided into two stages, with the first already completed in February this year. The second stage will represent a further investment of up to $5 million, bringing the total refurbishment cost to about $8m, he says. Resident MacMillan Tollo is now living in one of the units renovated during the first phase of the refurbishment. He suffers from an artery blockage, for which he has undergone three operations. ""I can't walk more than 50 metres because my leg swells up, so I am very happy there will be somewhere close for me to go."" The new hall will facilitate community spirit, he says. ""In the 13 years I have lived here, I haven't seen much neighbourly spirit. ""After the changes, life will be good."" - Stuff"
411,"Abu Dhabi residents have expressed their concern over what they describe as excessive utility charges in the Emirate. Several residents who spoke to Abu Dhabi National cited high electricity and water bills, with some saying the charges have doubled in recent months. The rising cost of living in Abu Dhabi has been a concern for many residents, with utility bills being a significant contributor. One resident said that their monthly water bill went from AED 100 to AED 300, while their electricity bill increased from AED 400 to AED 700 in just a few months. Another resident said that although they were aware of the gradual increase in utility charges, they did not expect to experience such a drastic change in their bills. “We have been using the same amount of water and electricity for the past year, but suddenly our bills have skyrocketed,” they said. Many residents have also raised concerns over the lack of transparency in the billing process. Some say that the billing statement does not provide a clear breakdown of the charges, making it difficult for them to understand the sudden increase in their bills. “It is frustrating when you receive a bill that is twice the amount you usually pay, but when you try to understand the charges, there is no proper explanation,” said one resident. The Abu Dhabi Distribution Company (ADDC) is responsible for the distribution of water and electricity in the Emirate, and it has acknowledged the concerns raised by residents. In a statement, ADDC said that it is continuously reviewing its prices to ensure they are regulated and fair to all customers. “ADDC assures its customers of its commitment to providing reliable and sustainable services at competitive prices. We are also aware of the concerns raised by some of our customers, and we are working to address them,” the statement read. In addition to reviewing prices, ADDC said it is also working to enhance customer service by providing more information and guidance on how to manage energy consumption. The authority also urged customers to monitor their usage and take steps to reduce it where possible. The Emirate has been making efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and promote sustainable living in recent years. In 2021, Abu Dhabi launched its green energy strategy that aims to reduce carbon emissions by up to 25% by 2030. As part of the strategy, the Emirate plans to increase the share of renewable energy in its total energy mix to 50% by 2030. While residents support the move toward sustainability, some say that they should not bear the burden of the increased costs associated with it. They want the government and utility providers to devise fairer approaches to billing while also promoting sustainable practices. Abu Dhabi National will continue to monitor the issue and provide updates as they become available. In the meantime, residents are encouraged to contact their utility provider if they have any concerns or questions on their bills.","ABU DHABI // Residents in some of the capital’s exclusive gated communities have expressed concern over what they claim are excessive charges for chilled water since a new utility billing company took over. In July, Al Zeina, Al Muneera, Al Bandar and other Al Raha beach communities had the company responsible for district cooling services changed from Dimarco to Tasleem. Both charge users based on metered consumption of chilled water. Residents, however, are questioning a new “infrastructure service charge” that they claim has resulted in huge increases to their monthly bill. “In effect, this has increased our monthly chilled water charge by between 50 and 300 per cent,” said Briton M W, who has been living in Al Zeina for a year. “In my case, it’s a 132 per cent increase.” The 60-year-old was paying an average of Dh260 a month to Dimarco compared with the Dh600 a month he now pays to Tasleem. He said that 33 per cent of the amount was because of the infrastructure charge. “Without Tasleem’s infrastructure charge, it would still be a 35 per cent increase over Dimarco,” he said. “But with the warmer weather of late, I could accept this. I would liken this to staying in a hotel, then having my room rate doubled to cover hotel maintenance.” A Dutch tenant in Al Zeina said the charges should be based on consumption only. Her Tasleem bill amounted to Dh332 of which Dh44.09 was the metred usage. Dh288 was the infrastructure charge. “The more you use, the more you pay,” I S said. “Also, this would mean that clients that are environmentally conscious are better off.” An Al Muneera resident said he used to pay Dimarco between Dh1,000 and Dh1,200 a year for consumption charges on a three-bedroom apartment, with no fixed monthly fee. “We used to pay Dimarco Dh60 during the normally hot months and Dh150 during the hotter months,” said A L, 40. “My bill for July was Dh354, Dh66 of which was for consumption and Dh288 for what they call the infrastructure service charge,” the Italian said. “It’s unbelievable. You cannot change the company name, provide the same service and ask four times more than what we were paying before.” Emirati A A, however, said he had experienced a drop in prices. “I have owned a villa in Al Raha Gardens since 2010 and in comparison to last year’s June/July bill of Dh1,800, I have seen it drop this year to Dh1,200.” A Tasleem spokesman said the infrastructure charge was “not an additional charge levied by the company, and had always been part of the overall cooling fees paid by consumers”. “Tasleem has separated the infrastructure service charge from the consumption charge to bring greater transparency to customers’ invoices,” he said. “The fee structure is a standard industry practice, and is in line with global benchmarks.” Residents also complained of being required to pay a Dh3,000 deposit, 300 per cent more than that charged by Dimarco. rruiz@thenational.ae"
412,"In recent weeks, Rutgers football has made headlines for all the wrong reasons. Several players have found themselves in trouble with the law, prompting concern and criticism from fans and the broader community. Here's a recap of what's known so far about the arrests: On August 2, linebacker Brendon White was arrested for driving while intoxicated. White, a transfer from Ohio State who was expected to play a key role for the Scarlet Knights this season, was pulled over in New Brunswick and failed a field sobriety test. He has since been suspended from the team. On August 19, defensive back Donovan Bunch was arrested and charged with simple assault. According to police reports, Bunch got into an altercation at a party in Piscataway and punched someone in the face. He has also been suspended from the team. On August 20, linebacker Chauncey Bailey was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia. Bailey was a three-star recruit who had yet to play for the Scarlet Knights, but his potential was evident. He, too, has been suspended from the team. The most recent arrest came on August 24, when defensive back Tre Avery was charged with driving while intoxicated. Avery, a sophomore, was pulled over in Piscataway and failed a field sobriety test. He has been suspended indefinitely from the team. In response to these incidents, Rutgers head coach Greg Schiano has emphasized the need for accountability and discipline within the program. ""These young men made poor choices, and they will be held accountable for their actions,"" Schiano said in a statement. ""We will continue to emphasize the importance of making good decisions, and we will work to help these players learn from their mistakes and grow as individuals."" Schiano has also stressed the importance of player safety and responsibility, particularly in the age of COVID-19. ""Our players have a responsibility to themselves, their teammates, and the broader community to follow guidelines and protocols that will keep everyone safe and healthy,"" he said. ""We cannot afford to take any risks or cut any corners."" Despite the recent arrests, Rutgers football has reason for optimism heading into the 2021 season. Schiano, who previously coached the Scarlet Knights from 2001 to 2011, returned to the program last year and led a resurgence, culminating in a surprise victory over Michigan State. With several key players returning, including quarterback Noah Vedral and running back Isaih Pacheco, and a promising group of incoming freshmen, Rutgers is poised to continue its upward trajectory. But first, the program must address the issues surrounding the recent arrests and work to ensure that all players understand the importance of responsibility and accountability. The university has also made clear that it takes these incidents seriously and is committed to addressing them in a responsible and effective manner. ""Rutgers University is committed to having a culture of integrity and accountability in its athletics program, and that includes addressing incidents of misconduct promptly and thoroughly,"" said athletic director Pat Hobbs in a statement. ""We will work with Coach Schiano and his staff to ensure that these incidents are fully investigated and that appropriate action is taken."" As the football season approaches, Rutgers fans remain hopeful for a successful year on the field, but also mindful of the need for discipline and accountability off the field. The recent arrests serve as a reminder of the importance of responsible behavior and the consequences that can result from poor choices.","NEW BRUNSWICK — Neighbors and others who knew them reacted with a mixture of sadness and shock at news of the arrests of five recently active Rutgers University football players who authorities said were among a larger group of suspects charged in connection with a string of crimes, including an assault and a number of home-invasion robberies. RELATED: First of several arrests in alleged spree made one month ago A total of 10 suspects were charged following an investigation into an incident the night of April 26, when three masked men burst into a New Brunswick home and robbed five Rutgers students at gunpoint. Authorities have since linked various suspects to other, subsequent crimes, including a second home-invasion robbery on Hartwell Street the following night and an attempted robbery at a Livingston College dorm in May. Six of the suspects face riot and assault charges stemming from yet another incident, a violent confrontation on Delafield Street April 25. The announcement of the arrests, coming just before the start of the college football season, is yet another mark against Rutgers athletics, at a particularly bad time for head coach Kyle Flood . It is also another test for the Middlesex County prosecutor's office, which just this week announced the outcome of the last high-profile case of football players' alleged violence in the Sayreville hazing incident. Along with the five recently active players, who have all been suspended from the team , the suspects include the daughter of a high school football coach and a brother of one of the players. The suspects also include a former Rutgers University player, Tejay Johnson, 23, who was charged on Aug. 5 with armed robbery, criminal restraint and weapons offenses, court records show. It was not the first time the standout defensive back was in legal trouble — he was accused of beating and robbing a man in Egg Harbor, charges that were later dropped . ""It's heartbreaking,"" said a college coach in Johnson's hometown of Egg Harbor who followed his career. ""We were just talking about him. Was he going back to Rutgers this year?"" In addition to Johnson — alleged to be involved in every incident and jailed on $650,000 bail — the other suspects are: Andre Boggs, a starting cornerback , who is being held on $500,000 bail, according to the Middlesex County Adult Corrections Center in North Brunswick. He was involved in the Hartwell Street and Livingston College invasions, authorities said. He has been widely regarded as a hero in his native Coatesville, Pa., a small rural town where, as one resident said Thursday, ""everybody knows everybody."" Nadir Barnwell, the cornerback whose academic status the head coach allegedly meddled in. He was charged with aggravated assault and riot in the alleged Delafield assault. Thursday evening, he was in the process of being bailed out of jail, records show. Ruhann Peele, who has just moved past his own legal issues stemming from an assault charge , was jailed on $25,000 bail, according to records. He was also accused in the Delafield assault. ""I hope this doesn't affect his scholarship,"" said Dr. Marlena Berghammer, a neighbor of Peele's mother. ""I hope he doesn't [lose it], he was the one in his family his mother was counting on. His mother works so hard,"" she said, also describing Peele as a ""good boy"" who ""keeps to himself."" Rahzonn Gross, a sophomore fullback who allegedly participated in the attack on Delafield Street. Bail was set at $25,000, prosecutors said. Delon Stephenson, a junior defensive back from Sayreville, also charged in the Delafield attack. Bail was set at $75,000. Daryl Stephenson, Delon's brother, who prosecutors said Thursday was still at large. Bail was set at $25,000, again in the alleged Delafield attack. Jianan Chen, 19, of New Brunswick, and Dylan Mastriana, 19, a Rutgers student, allegedly planned several of the home invasions, prosecutors said. Bail was set at $500,000 for Mastriana and $100,000 for Chen. It's unclear where they're being held. Kaylanna Ricks, charged with driving the getaway car in a home invasion.

413,"As the dust settles on the 2015 AFL season, it's clear that the Richmond Tigers are a team under pressure heading into next year. Once again, they have finished their campaign disappointingly, leaving fans and pundits alike scratching their heads and wondering why they can't seem to make it over the hump. While Richmond fans will no doubt take some solace in the fact that they made it to the finals for the second year in a row, the fact remains that they were outclassed by North Melbourne in the elimination final. The Tigers were thoroughly outplayed by a Kangaroos side that was simply more hungry and more desperate on the day. This defeat was made all the more painful by the fact that it was the second year in a row that Richmond has been knocked out in the first round of the finals. For a club that has aspirations of winning a premiership, this is simply not good enough. One of the biggest concerns facing Richmond heading into next season is their lack of consistency. At times this year, they looked like one of the most dangerous teams in the competition, with the likes of Dustin Martin and Jack Riewoldt firing on all cylinders. But at other times, they looked lost and disorganised, with their midfield struggling to get their hands on the ball and their defence leaking goals. Another problem that the Tigers face is their inability to win big games. They may have made it to the finals two years in a row, but they have still not won a final since 2001. When the pressure is on, too often Richmond has faltered, and this is a worrying trend for any team that hopes to challenge for the title. Off the field, Richmond's woes are just as significant. The club has been plagued by off-field issues for much of the year, with allegations of player misconduct and a drug scandal hanging over the club. While these issues may have been resolved for now, they have undoubtedly taken a toll on the team's morale and could continue to do so in the future. So where does Richmond go from here? The Tigers have made some promising signings in recent years, including rising star Corey Ellis, who has shown himself to be a real talent in his first year in the AFL. But they will need more than just one player to turn things around. One area that Richmond may look to address is their midfield. While they have some talented players in this position, they have struggled to dominate games in the way that other top sides have done. A strong, deep midfield is crucial to any team with premiership aspirations, and it's an area that the Tigers will need to improve if they hope to compete with the best in the business. Overall, it's clear that the Tigers have a lot of work to do if they hope to turn their fortunes around in 2016. They need to find consistency, improve their midfield, and find a way to win the big games that matter. Meanwhile, off the field, the club must work to repair its tarnished reputation and rebuild the trust of its fans. It won't be easy, but it's not impossible. The talent is there, and with a little bit of luck and a lot of hard work, Richmond could well be challenging for the flag next year. But if they fail to make significant improvements, it could be another long, disappointing season for the Tiger faithful.","Richmond made progress in 2015 with impressive wins over top teams. But then they made their third elimination-final exit in a row. 2015 season review Team: Richmond looked to have made progress in 2015 with impressive wins over the league's elite. But all of that may have been wasted through a third-straight elimination-final exit. What should Tiger supporters take out of the year? Position: Fifth (at end of home and away games, 15-7). Lost to North Melbourne in an elimination final. Last season: Eighth (12-11) Players used: 38 Personnel changes: It's been a stable era for the Tigers, with coach Damien Hardwick and chief executive Brendon Gale in unison since 2010, and with president Peggy O'Neal – in her second season in charge after replacing Gary March – adding her voice to their calls for patience from fans. However, Hardwick has only a year left on his contract, and the Tigers face an intriguing debate this summer over whether to extend his deal in a show of faith or wait until next season and see if an important step is made. We know what the Tigers of old would do. On the field, Taylor Hunt was a success in midfield, playing in 23 matches after joining from Geelong. Kamdyn McIntosh, after a 2014 campaign derailed by injury, would also become a regular. Out the door: Veteran Chris Newman revealed in August he intended to retire, and the Tigers had hoped to finally deliver a finals win for the veteran defender. But it wasn't to be and, after 268 games and 14 seasons, Newman retired on Sunday without that cherished victory. Chris Knights' wretched run with injury has forced the talented forward into retirement. Ruckman Shaun Hampson is one of a handful of players fighting to retain his spot. What went right: Wins over Fremantle at Domain Stadium, over the Swans at the SCG and Hawthorn at the MCG were impressive. The Tigers were tough in the clinches through the home-and-away campaign, recording a contested-possession differential of +7.9, ranked fourth in the league, but they were -33 against the Kangaroos. Key forward Ty Vickery came of age but he will be haunted over summer by his miss for goal late in the elimination final. Overall, Brett Deledio emerged as a goal-kicking star (except in the elimination final), Jack Riewoldt was unselfish, Alex Rance inked a long-term contract and was superb in defence, Dustin Martin was a force, McIntosh and Hunt added depth and small forward Shane Edwards continued to show his toughness. The team matured in its ability to execute a game plan. What went wrong: A third-straight exit in an elimination final, blowing – as they did against Carlton in 2013 – a strong lead. Board expectations were that the Tigers would win at least one final. While there was progress through the season, their campaign may ultimately be remembered for questionable selection decisions last week in recalling the underdone Ben Griffiths (first match since round 17) and Reece Conca (first game since round 19 and only third of the year) for the elimination final, after Ben Lennon and Sam Lloyd had been regular selections at the back end of the season. The Tigers had learnt to be more patient through the season, particularly when counter-attacking from half-back, but their skills against the Kangaroos when the pressure was at its fiercest were sloppy. Ruckman Ivan Maric was a warrior but he struggled against bigger-bodied types such as Todd Goldstein. Skipper Trent Cotchin had a stinker when it counted but could Hardwick have helped him more? Shining lights: Alex Rance, Brett Deledio, Shane Edwards, Dustin Martin, Jack Riewoldt, Brandon Ellis and Troy Chaplin had strong home-and-away seasons. But Chaplin, Edwards, Deledio and Ellis were among those to have had a poor finish. What's required to improve in 2016: The bottom line, as Essendon great and prominent commentator Tim Watson says, is that the Tigers still don't have enough players who can play high-level finals football. They need to find a consistent goal-kicking small forward, with Chris Yarran – used as a rebounding half-back at Carlton in recent seasons – firmly on the radar. The Tigers felt they were the frontrunner to secure smooth-moving Giant Adam Treloar, but they are now only an outside chance. They need to find themselves a quality back-up big man for Maric, while it's also time to look for a defender to help Rance. Jake Carlisle anyone? Club great Kevin Bartlett has urged an ""ambitious"" off-season recruiting plan. Who'd have believed it: Another finals disaster would have resulted in Hardwick's instant sacking in the 1980s and '90s. He will be back for 2016. Grade: Were expected to win a final.

414,"The Georgia Society of Certified Public Accountants (GSCPA) has announced the winners of the second annual Georgia Accounting Food Fight, which took place on November 15th. This unique event brought together accounting firms across the state to compete in a food drive challenge to support the Atlanta Community Food Bank. The event saw 16 accounting firms compete against each other to collect as many non-perishable goods as possible. The competition was fierce, with each firm going above and beyond to make their donations count. In total, over 24,000 pounds of food were collected, surpassing last year’s total of 20,000 pounds. The winners of the competition were determined by calculating the amount of food donated per employee to even the playing field for smaller firms. The top prize went to PKF, a top-15 Atlanta accounting firm, who collected an impressive 779 pounds of food per employee. The second-place prize was awarded to Frazier & Deeter, another top Atlanta accounting firm, with 621 pounds of food per employee. Honorable mentions went to Aprio, with 503 pounds per employee, and Mauldin & Jenkins, with 362 pounds per employee. “We are overwhelmed by the support we received from the accounting community for the Georgia Accounting Food Fight,” said Rachel Warner, Executive Director of the Atlanta Community Food Bank. “Every year, we see an increase in the number of firms participating and the amount of food collected. These donations make a significant impact on the thousands of Georgians who rely on our services.” The Georgia Accounting Food Fight is one of several community outreach events organized by the GSCPA.

415,"Ryan Murphy, the creator of ""American Horror Story,"" has been teasing fans with what's in store for the upcoming season of the show, entitled ""Hotel."" In a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy spoke about some of the major plot points fans can expect to see. One major spoiler is the return of fan-favorite actress Jessica Lange to the show. Lange has been a staple of the ""American Horror Story"" universe since its inception, but took a break from the series last season. Murphy confirmed that Lange will be back for ""Hotel,"" though her role has not yet been revealed. Another big reveal was that Lady Gaga will be joining the cast for the new season. Murphy has already promised that Gaga's character will be ""evil"" and ""bad,"" and that she'll be playing a hotel owner. In the same interview, Murphy teased that there will be multiple romances throughout the course of the season, including a love triangle between characters played by Matt Bomer, Chloe Sevigny, and Wes Bentley. Of course, one of the biggest draws of ""American Horror Story"" is the creepy and often grotesque visuals that are a hallmark of the show. Murphy assured fans that ""Hotel"" will not disappoint in this regard, saying that the set pieces for this season are ""breathtaking and beautiful, but also creepy."" He also promised that there will be plenty of ""blood and gore"" throughout the season. As for the overall theme of the season, Murphy has revealed that ""Hotel"" will be heavily influenced by horror films from the 1930s and 1940s. Specifically, he cited the 1935 film ""Bride of Frankenstein"" as a major inspiration. ""Bride of Frankenstein"" was a sequel to the original Frankenstein movie, and follows Dr. Frankenstein's attempts to create a mate for his original monster. While there is still much that we don't know about ""American Horror Story: Hotel,"" Ryan Murphy's recent interview has given fans plenty to speculate about. With the addition of Lady Gaga and Jessica Lange's return to the series, as well as the promise of romance, creepy visuals, and horror movie influences, ""Hotel"" is sure to be another season that leaves audiences simultaneously thrilled and terrified.","American Horror Story: Hotel Facebook/American Horror Story: Hotel Showrunner Ryan Murphy recently unveiled three promos for the upcoming season of ""American Horror Story"" entitled ""Hotel"" and the clips have given viewers a glimpse into the horrors lurking behind the walls of Hotel Cortez. The first clip is entitled ""Towhead"" and it shows a group of platinum blond children walking down a flight of stairs. They are joined by another group of equally-terrifying kids at the bottom of the stairs. It is not immediately known who these children are, but as Murphy told Entertainment Weekly , ""There's nothing scarier than a platinum blonde baby running around doing evil deeds."" The second trailer, ""Sleepwalker"", shows viewers someone being sewn into a mattress, and the third clip, ""Jeepers Peepers,"" shows the office of original hotel owner and serial killer James March. ""AHS: Hotel"" is set in modern day Los Angeles, and the events in season 5 takes place approximately five years after season 1 of ""American Horror Story."" Therefore, chances are high Jessica Lange's character, the manipulative Constance, could appear in ""Hotel."" ""I've been talking to her,"" Murphy told Entertainment Weekly . ""It's always possible. I'm trying to deal with her play schedule. Jessica is always about the character. She'll be back—she's not gone forever. But that's the fun and fresh thing about the show: sometimes somebody has to go away before you realise how much you miss them. She wants to come back we just have to come up with something."" Another character that will return from the first season is Marcy, the character essayed by Christine Estabrook. Marcy was the realtor who sold the haunted house to the Harmons, and not surprisingly, she is the real estate agent for Hotel Cortez too. Marcy's appearance is not a surprise, as Murphy had earlier revealed that all the seasons of ""American Horror Story"" are interconnected. ""They're all connected,"" Murphy told Entertainment Weekly last October. ""We're just beginning to tell you how they're connected. They're all very separate but there are clues every season that we're now telling you how the different worlds are intertwined."" FX is set to premiere season 5 of ""American Horror Story: Hotel"" in October. Article Published: September 2, 2015 19:3"
416,"The Energy Information Administration (EIA) has released a report outlining the benefits of the oil swap between Mexico and the United States. According to the report, the swap - which began in August of 2015 - allows Mexico to import lighter crude oil from the United States in exchange for heavy crude oil from Mexico. This has led to numerous benefits for both countries. For Mexico, the swap has allowed the country to access lighter crude oil that is better suited to their refining capabilities. This has not only improved the efficiency of their refineries, but has also allowed them to increase their production of high-value refined products such as gasoline and diesel. On the other hand, the United States has benefited from the swap by gaining access to heavy crude oil from Mexico that is well-suited to their refining capabilities. This has allowed them to increase their production of heavier refined products such as asphalt and fuel oil. Furthermore, the swap has also led to a decrease in transportation costs for both countries. By trading oil with each other, both Mexico and the United States have been able to reduce the distance that oil needs to be transported, as well as the associated costs. Overall, the swap has proven to be mutually beneficial for both countries, with the EIA reporting that it has increased economic efficiency and competitiveness, while also providing a reliable and stable source of oil for both parties. However, it is worth noting that the oil swap has not been without its challenges. For example, some experts have raised concerns over the environmental implications of the swap, particularly in relation to the increased production of refined products such as gasoline and diesel. Despite these challenges, the EIA remains optimistic about the long-term benefits of the oil swap between Mexico and the United States. With both countries continuing to work together to improve their refining capabilities and increase their production of high-value refined products, the swap is likely to remain a key part of the energy landscape in the years to come.","Oil Swap The EIA is reporting that oil swaps with Mexico will bring economic and environmental benefits to both countries. Related: Swapping Oil with Mexico Last month, the U.S. Department of Commerce opened the door for a limited amount of oil to be exported to Mexico through an exchange program that will allow the U.S. to ‘swap’ its light sweet crude for Mexican heavy sour crude. Light sweet refers to crude with a sulpher content of less than 0.42%. Currently, U.S. Gulf Coast refineries are better suited to process heavy sour crude and Mexican refineries are more equipped to process lighter crude. The swap will allow the two countries to optimize their existing refining processes and increase the supply of lower-sulfur gasoline from Mexican refineries. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) released a report last week saying that there may be significant environmental benefits from such oil exchanges. The partial substitution of Eagle Ford crude for Mexican crudes in Mexican refineries would free up sulfur removal capacity in the Mexican refining system. This would, in turn, allow that capacity to be used to produce more lower-sulfur gasoline than is currently possible. Any increased supply of lower-sulfur gasoline to Mexico’s motor gasoline market, which consumed 761,000 b/d in 2013, would result in reduced sulfur emissions and other environmental benefits. Currently, U.S. Gulf Coast refineries are better suited to process heavy sour crude and Mexican refineries are more equipped to process heavier crude. Many are hoping this new policy signifies a shift in opinion about the oil export ban that has been in effect since the 1970’s, but some analysts believe the effort may be mostly symbolic.

418,"Dubai property stocks such as Emaar Properties and Damac Properties rose on Monday, fueled by hopes that an upcoming industry exhibition would give a boost to the sector. The ""Cityscape Global"" exhibition, which will be held in Dubai from September 25-27, is expected to attract developers, investors, and other industry players from around the world. This has led to a sense of optimism among local property companies, which have been hit hard by oversupply and sluggish demand in recent years. Emaar Properties, the largest listed developer in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), rose 2.2%, while Damac Properties surged 5.7%. Other property firms, including Dubai Investments and Union Properties, also posted gains. However, analysts cautioned that the rally could be short-lived, as the industry still faces challenges such as falling rents, increased competition, and rising interest rates. They also noted that the exhibition alone is unlikely to solve the sector's underlying problems. ""Cityscape is always positive, but it's not going to be a game-changer,"" said Sanyalaksna Manibhandu, head of research at FAB Securities. ""The market still needs to consolidate, and there needs to be more demand coming in."" Overall, the Dubai index rose 0.3% on Monday, while the wider region was mixed.

419,"The growth of the UK's manufacturing sector slowed down last month, resulting in a corresponding decrease in hiring activity. The latest report by the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) suggests that this trend occurred due to supply chain disruptions and rising costs, which have been impacting businesses not just in the UK, but globally. The August PMI reading was 60.3, down from July's 60.4, marking the fourth consecutive month of decline. While the figure still indicates growth in the sector, the rate of growth has clearly slowed down. Furthermore, the survey also showed that employment in the manufacturing sector saw its largest drop since the government-imposed lockdowns last year. According to Sarah Banks, Managing Director of Trilogy Writing & Consultancy, ""The manufacturing industry remains in a strong position in the UK, but supply chain disruptions are starting to have an impact. Businesses are struggling to keep up with demand, which is resulting in rising costs and capacity constraints."" Banks further added that the continued impact of COVID-19 on shipping activity and rising prices of raw materials have contributed to the slowdown in the manufacturing sector's growth. The report observed that manufacturing firms are currently having to grapple with rising supply chain costs, alongside a shortage of raw materials and parts. As a result of these supply chain setbacks, purchasing activity in the manufacturing sector has shown a corresponding decline. The PMI report notes that this is the first such drop since December 2020. Moreover, backlogs of uncompleted work have risen to their highest levels since 1994, indicating that firms are increasingly struggling to keep pace with customer orders. Overall, the August PMI report indicates that the manufacturing sector in the UK is experiencing a slight slowdown, with supply chain challenges and rising costs causing some concerns for business leaders. However, despite the challenges, businesses remain optimistic about the future. The report revealed that firms are still investing in new products, hiring new staff, and increasing their marketing activities. Despite the current challenges faced by the manufacturing sector in the UK, the PMI report shows that businesses are still investing in growth and expansion. It is hoped that as global supply chain issues recede and businesses become more agile in response to the pandemic, the manufacturing sector will remain a key contributor to the UK's overall economic growth.","Men work on the production line at the London Taxi Company in Coventry, central England, September 11, 2013. REUTERS/Darren Staples LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - A two-year spell of jobs growth across British factories came to an end last month as manufacturing activity expanded at a slower pace, a survey showed, suggesting the sector is unlikely to boost economic growth much this quarter. The Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell in August to 51.5 from 51.9 in July, confounding expectations for a rise to 52.0. While still holding above the 50 threshold for growth, the survey underlined Britain's reliance on its services sector and big-spending consumers to drive the economy. There were mixed signals for the manufacturing outlook. New orders came in at the fastest pace in five months but export orders continued to contract, while backlogs of work shrank at the fastest pace since March 2013. And the PMI's jobs index fell below 50 for the first time since April 2013, adding to recent signs Britain's labour market has cooled off after a two-year strong run. ""The UK manufacturing sector remains in a holding pattern, with production growth hovering around the stagnation mark and marginal job losses reported for the first time in 26 months,"" said Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler Markit. ""On this basis, the sector looks unlikely to make much of a contribution to the solid gain in broader GDP growth expected for the third quarter."" Survey compiler Markit said worries about the health of the Chinese economy ought only to have a minimal impact on British manufacturers, given exports to China make up only a small proportion of the British total. But it added that it was too early to say if there would be any knock-on effects. A survey from manufacturing lobby EEF at the weekend suggested almost half of British manufacturers were worried about a possible sharp slowdown in China, with one-in-ten reviewing their business plans. Markit said prices paid by manufacturers for raw goods and energy plunged at the fastest pace since January, suggesting little sign of inflation pressure in the pipeline from British industry. Oil prices fell near a 6-1/2-year low last week, entrenching expectations of low inflation in advanced economies and pushing back market expectations for the first Bank of England interest rate hike from the Bank of England deep into next year. Last month the BoE stressed how a recent strengthening of the pound and a renewed fall in oil prices would push down inflation until at least the middle of next year, adding that the impact of a recent rise in sterling could persist even longer.

420,"MPs are set to vote on the issue of the right to die for the first time in over 20 years. The landmark debate comes after years of pressure from campaigners and the public, and could see legislation passed that would allow terminally ill patients to end their lives with medical assistance. The debate, which will take place in the House of Commons, will be a free vote, meaning that MPs will not be bound by party lines and will be able to vote according to their own conscience. Supporters of the right to die will be hoping for a positive result, which could pave the way for a change in the law. Currently, assisted dying is illegal in the UK, carrying a potential prison sentence of up to 14 years for anyone who helps another person to end their life. However, there are a growing number of people who believe that the law is outdated and unfair, and that those with terminal illnesses should have the right to die on their own terms. Campaigners argue that allowing assisted dying would give terminally ill patients the freedom to choose how and when they die, and would reduce the suffering that can often come with a prolonged illness. They also point out that other countries, such as Canada and the Netherlands, have already legalised assisted dying, and that the UK should follow suit. Opponents of the right to die, however, argue that legalising assisted dying could lead to a slippery slope, with vulnerable people being pressured into ending their lives prematurely. They also argue that it would undermine the efforts of healthcare professionals to provide palliative care and support to those with life-limiting illnesses. The debate is likely to be emotive and divisive, with MPs on both sides of the argument making passionate speeches and arguments. Some MPs who have spoken out in favour of the right to die include former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who said last year that the law should be changed, and Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell, who has described his own experience of watching his father suffer from a terminal illness. Others, such as Conservative MP Fiona Bruce, have said that they will vote against any change in the law, arguing that it would put vulnerable people at risk. The right to die has been a contentious issue for many years, with numerous cases making headlines and sparking public debate. One of the most high-profile cases was that of Tony Nicklinson, who suffered from locked-in syndrome and fought for the right to end his own life with medical assistance. His case was ultimately unsuccessful, but it brought the issue of the right to die to public attention. The current debate has been brought about by a private member's bill brought forward by Labour MP Rob Marris, which has cross-party support. The bill proposes that people with less than six months to live should be able to end their lives with medical assistance, subject to strict safeguards. If the bill is passed, it could be a significant victory for campaigners for the right to die, but it would still be subject to further scrutiny and debate before it becomes law. It is also likely to face opposition in the House of Lords, where some peers are known to be strongly opposed to assisted dying. Whatever the outcome of the vote, it is clear that the issue of the right to die is not going away. With an ageing population and advances in medical technology meaning that more people are living longer with serious illnesses, it is a difficult and complex issue that will continue to be debated and discussed for years to come.","MPs are set to vote on the right to die for the first time in almost 20 years today as controversial laws are subject to a landmark debate. Labour MP Rob Marris will introduce the Assisted Dying Bill after coming top of the Private Members' Bill ballot following the general election. Labour MP Rob Marris will introduce the Assisted Dying Bill The legislation, which passed an initial vote in the House of Lords last year but failed to become law, is a first key question of conscience for the new House of Commons. MPs have a free vote on the issue, which will break across party lines. Mr Marris said the current law was a ""mess"" and his Bill was about offering people ""choice and dignity"". In a blog post ahead of the debate, the Wolverhampton South West MP said: ""With appropriate, strong safeguards, terminally ill adults of sound mind should be legally allowed to choose to have assistance to end their own lives. ""I value life, and I do understand that some people believe very deeply that ending one's own life is always wrong. Nevertheless, the depth and sincerity of their belief should not mean that they deny choice to those of us who do not share their beliefs."" Under the Bill's clauses, two doctors and a High Court judge would have to be satisfied of the requesting patient's eligibility - defined as being terminally ill with less than six months to live, mentally fit to make the decision and aware of alternatives - before the right to die would be allowed. The patient must administer the fatal medication themselves under the rules in the Bill. Mr Marris added: ""At present the law denies dying people the choice of a safe, legal assisted death, whilst turning a blind eye to home suicides, and to technically illegal actions by doctors, and to Dignitas deaths. ""Last summer the Supreme Court issued Parliament with a final warning, to address the problems - in a democracy it is elected representatives who should make the laws. ""As an MP, as a lawyer, and as an individual, I am convinced that we can and should allow better choice for dying people."" The Bill is certain to be strongly opposed by MPs on both sides of the Commons, and spark noisy debate outside Parliament's walls. Former GP and Tory MP Sarah Wollaston said she would not back the legislation because of fears ""the wider harms outweigh the benefits"". She said: ""For all the Bill's supposed safeguards, once we cross the line to allow medically assisted dying we risk ending up in a very different place and with very different attitudes to the value of life. ""Far better in my view for Parliament to focus on the urgent need to improve palliative care."" Prime Minister David Cameron is to miss the free vote as he attends regional visits. A spokesman said: ""The Prime Minister has made his views clear on this issue before. He is not convinced that further steps need to be taken and he is not in favour of an approach that would take us closer to euthanasia."" A Commons vote on the right to die has not been held since 1997. Mr Marris' Bill faces a tough road to the statute book though e nough MPs are expected to stay in Westminster for the debate to ensure a second reading vote takes place. At least 100 MPs will need to be present to vote for a closure motion to end the debate and force a division before 2.30pm. If a closure motion is not passed, opponents could try and talk the Bill past the deadline effectively dooming its chance of progress. If the Bill does win a second reading today, as backbench legislation it can only be considered on a small number of Friday sittings of the Commons but still needs to go through all the normal legislative stages. This offers opponents further chances to talk it out of time with many amendments and lengthy speeches at later stages. A similar Bill, introduced by Lord Falconer, was granted a second reading by the House of Lords following a marathon and impassioned debate last year. It was subject to two days of detailed committee stage debate but failed to make progress before the election. Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved."
421,"New research has suggested that the seeds of Alzheimer’s disease might be transferred from one patient to another through medical instruments. The study, conducted by a team of scientists at University College London, found that proteins which are thought to cause Alzheimer’s can cling to surgical instruments and potentially pass from one person to another during an operation. This discovery highlights the need for even greater precautions to be taken when dealing with medical equipment, with strict cleaning routines and sterilisation measures being implemented in order to ensure patient safety. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia and affects around 850,000 people in the UK alone. Symptoms of the disease include memory loss, confusion, and difficulties with speech and language. The researchers at UCL used a protein known as beta-amyloid, which is believed to be one of the main culprits behind Alzheimer’s, to conduct their experiments. They found that when beta-amyloid was applied to surgical instruments and then placed into the brains of mice, the protein was able to cause the formation of amyloid plaques, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. These plaques are made up of fragments of the beta-amyloid protein and can damage brain cells, leading to the symptoms of Alzheimer’s. Dr. John Collinge, who led the study, said: “Our results show that surgical instruments exposed to even very small amounts of amyloid-beta amyloid protein can seed the formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of mice.” He added: “This highlights the importance of preventing the transfer of amyloid-beta on surgical instruments in any surgeries involving the brain or any other tissue that is susceptible to Alzheimer’s disease.” The study also found that the beta-amyloid protein remains stable on surgical instruments for several days, even after being sterilised, demonstrating the need for extra care to be taken when cleaning medical equipment. Prof. Simon Lovestone, who co-authored the study, said: “This research underscores the need for better infection control procedures, regular monitoring of surgical instruments and cleaning practices, and research to develop new decontamination techniques.” He added: “It also highlights the importance of improving techniques to identify and isolate the proteins that cause Alzheimer’s disease.” The research, which was funded by the Medical Research Council and the National Institute for Health Research, has been published in the journal Science Translational Medicine. It follows on from previous studies which have suggested that other medical procedures, such as blood transfusions or the use of growth hormone, could also potentially transfer the seeds of Alzheimer’s disease. Dr. Collinge said: “The evidence is accumulating that the seeds of many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s can be transferred from person to person through medical procedures, although the risks are thought to be low.” He added: “However, the potential risks of these transfers of disease-causing proteins underlines the need for stringent controls and precautions to minimise the risk of such transmission.” The authors of the study are now calling for further research to be conducted in order to better understand the risks associated with the transfer of Alzheimer’s-causing proteins during medical procedures. They are also calling for improved decontamination techniques to be developed, as well as for patients to be made more aware of the risks associated with medical procedures and the measures being taken to reduce them. Overall, this study highlights the need for proper infection control measures to be taken in all medical settings, with the potential consequences of not doing so being severe and life-changing for patients.","Seeds of Alzheimer's disease can potentially attach to surgical instruments and be transferred from one person to another during certain medical procedures, a study suggests. The findings provide the first evidence of dementia transmission in humans via microscopic protein fragments. Health officials and experts were quick to reassure the public after the highly controversial research was reported in the leading journal Nature. However the findings prompted speculation about the safety of some medical procedures, including dental treatments. Blood donations are not considered a meaningful risk, but should be investigated as a precaution, say the researchers. British scientists stumbled on the discovery while investigating a rare form of ""iatrogenic"" Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease (iCJD), a brain-destroying condition known to be spread by contaminated surgical instruments and procedures. They inspected the brains of eight patients who died from the disease after receiving pituitary growth hormone extracted from cadavers. Unexpectedly, six bore a clear molecular hallmark of Alzheimer's - sticky clumps of fragmented protein called amyloid beta that form among neurons and on the walls of blood vessels. In four cases, the amyloid deposits were widespread and only one patient was not affected at all. All eight individuals were relatively young, aged 36 to 51, and none had genetic variants associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The evidence points to the hormone carrying ""seeds"" of the Alzheimer's protein into the patients' brains as well as CJD. Since the prion proteins responsible for iCJD can be transmitted in other ways - for instance, by neurosurgery - experts are not ruling out the possibility that the same is true for the Alzheimer's molecule. Promoted stories Lead scientist Professor John Collinge, director of the Medical Research Council Prion Unit at University College London, said there was increasing evidence that neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's might, in rare circumstances, be ""acquired"". Speaking on a phone-link to the British Science Festival taking place at the University of Bradford, he said: "" You could have three different ways you have these protein seeds generated in your brain. Either they happen spontaneously, an unlucky event as you age, or you have got a faulty gene, or you've been exposed to a medical accident. That's what we're hypothesising."" He pointed out that , like CJD prions, amyloid beta protein fragments stick to metal surfaces and resist conventional sterilisation. Previous experiments on laboratory mice and monkeys had already shown that transmission of the Alzheimer's protein is theoretically possible. When liquified brain tissue from dead Alzheimer's patients was injected into the central nervous systems of the animals, they developed the brain changes associated with the disease. The scientists do not believe CJD prions somehow triggered the development of amyloid beta deposits in the brains of the growth hormone patients. B rains of 116 patients with prion diseases who had not received pituitary growth hormone did not have the Alzheimer's hallmark, and the two diseases affect different brain areas. Other research has shown th at amyloid beta can form in the pituitary gland, a pea-sized body at the base of the brain. None of the patients had developed Alzheimer's symptoms and their brains did not show another key change associated with the disease, twisted strands of protein within nerve cells called tau tangles. Whether or not they would have started to suffer symptoms had they lived longer remains an unanswered question. Questioned specifically about dentistry, Prof Collinge said: ""The seeds will potentially stick to metal surfaces whatever the instrument is. With prions, we know quite a lot about that. Certainly, there are potential risks with dentistry where it's impacting on nervous tissue, for example root canal treatment, and special precautions are taken with reamers that are used in root canal treatment for that reason, in the UK at least. ""If you are speculating that amyloid beta seeds might be transferred by instruments, one would have to consider whether certain types of dental procedure might be relevant."" He stressed there was no epidemiological evidence at all to suggest that Alzheimer's could be transmitted via blood transfusions, but added: ""I think it's not unreasonable to have a look. My concerns would be more to see if there is a risk of seeding from metal surfaces. I think that is something we ought to prioritise."" Later he appeared to backtrack on dental treatments, issuing a statement saying the current data had ""no bearing"" on dental surgery and ""certainly do not argue that dentistry poses a risk of Alzheimer's disease"". Prof Collinge said: ""Our findings relate to the specific circumstance of cadaver-derived human growth hormone injections, a treatment that was discontinued many years ago. It is possible our findings might be relevant to some other medical or surgical procedures, but evaluating what risk, if any, there might be requires much further research."" Meanwhile, he urged people not to be concerned about planned medical procedures, and to dismiss any notion of Alzheimer's being ""contagious"" in the same way as flu, for instance. ""No way is this suggesting that Alzheimer's is a contagious disease,"" he said. ""You can't catch it by living with someone who has Alzheimer's disease or being a carer. ""I don't want to cause any alarm. No-one should consider cancelling or delaying any kind of surgery. But I think it would be prudent to do some research in this area going forward."" The chief medical officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, also stepped in to reassure the public, maintaining there was ""no evidence"" that Alzheimer's disease can be transmitted in humans through any medical procedure. She added: ""This was a small study on only eight samples. We monitor research closely and there is a large research programme in place to help us understand and respond to the challenges of Alzheimer's. ""I can reassure people that the NHS has extremely stringent procedures in place to minimise infection risk from surgical equipment, and patients are very well protected."" Treatment of people of short stature with pituitary growth hormone taken from dead donors began in the UK in 1958. It was stopped in 1985 after confirmed reports of CJD among recipients. Because growth hormone from different cadavers was mixed up before being distributed, a treatment given to an individual patient may have originated from a large number of donors. This greatly increased the risk of disease transmission. In total, 1,848 men and women in the UK underwent the procedure for stunted growth, and of these 77 have so far died from CJD. As of 2012, 450 cases of iatrogenic CJD have been identified around the world linked to cadaver-derived growth hormone and to a lesser extent other medical procedures, including corneal transplants and neurosurgery. The fear is that Alzheimer's protein seeds could follow similar transmission pathways as CJD prions. Dr Eric Karran, chief scientist at the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said: "" The biggest risk factor for Alzheimer's is age, along with genetic and lifestyle factors. If further research was to confirm a link between historical tissue contamination and Alzheimer's, it would only likely be relevant to a tiny proportion of the total number of people affected."" Dr Doug Brown, director of research at Alzheimer's Society, said: "" Injections of growth hormone taken from human brains were stopped in the 1980s. There remains absolutely no evidence that Alzheimer's disease is contagious or can be transmitted from person to person via any current medical procedures."" Professor Nigel Hunt, dean of the faculty of dental surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons, said: ""This study alone does not provide any conclusive proof that Alzheimer's disease can be transmitted from person to person. Dental practice carries no more risk than any invasive clinical procedure. This is new research in a field of relatively recent scientific enquiry that needs to be taken seriously with further research to inform any changes to all clinical and dental practice. ""In dentistry, patients are protected from infection risks through the widespread use of single use instruments. All dental instruments that are reused are covered either by guidance from Nice (National Institute of Health and Care Excellence) or guidance about decontamination in primary care dental practices. The findings from today's study must be considered by all relevant organisations to ensure current guidance is as robust as it needs to be."" The British Dental Association's scientific adviser, Professor Damien Walmsley, said: ""Dentists take patient safety very seriously and follow strict protocols to protect patients from the risk of infections, however slight that risk may be.

""These measures make dentistry one of the safest areas of healthcare."""

423,"In a thrilling marathon race through the streets of Boston, runner Tyler Curtin and Victoria Rocha put on an impressive display of athleticism, cruising past the mile marker with ease. The race began at the crack of dawn, with thousands of runners lacing up their shoes and preparing to embark on the 26.2-mile journey through the city. As the starting gun sounded, the crowd surged forward, and it quickly became clear that Curtin and Rocha were the ones to watch. Curtin, a seasoned marathoner with years of experience under his belt, set a blistering pace from the outset. He quickly surged to the front of the pack, leaving his competitors struggling to keep up. Rocha, meanwhile, proved to be a formidable challenger in the women's race. The young runner deftly navigated the winding course, making quick work of the hills and taking full advantage of the flat stretches to power ahead. As the race wore on, the two runners began to pull away from the pack. With each passing mile marker, their lead grew, and the spectators lining the course began to take notice. By the time Curtin and Rocha had passed the halfway point, it was clear that they were the ones to beat. Their rivals lagged several minutes behind, unable to match their impressive pace. Despite the grueling nature of the race, neither Curtin nor Rocha seemed to be slowing down. They remained focused and determined, gritting their teeth and pushing on through the pain. As they cruised past the 20-mile marker, the finish line loomed tantalizingly in the distance. The crowd roared as the two runners pushed themselves to the limit, each determined to emerge victorious. In the end, it was Curtin who crossed the finish line first, with a time of 2 hours, 10 minutes, and 34 seconds. Rocha was not far behind, finishing second overall and setting a personal best time of 2 hours, 14 minutes, and 12 seconds. The two runners embraced after the race, congratulating each other on a job well done. ""It was a tough race, but we pushed each other to our limits,"" Curtin said. ""I'm proud of what we accomplished today."" For Rocha, the race marked a major milestone in her running career. ""I learned a lot about myself today,"" she said. ""I know that I can compete at this level and hold my own against the best of the best."" As the other runners trickled in, exhausted but elated after completing the grueling course, Curtin and Rocha stood tall as the victors of the day. For these two incredible athletes, the Boston Marathon would forever stand as a testament to their skill and determination.","WRENTHAM — Julia Curtin planned to run the Wrentham Developmental Center course just once before the upcoming state cross country championship in November, so she made that one time memorable. At yesterday’s Frank Kelley Invitational, the Beverly sophomore took advantage of picture-perfect conditions to shake Newton South’s Clare Martin shortly after a fast 5:20 opening mile in the Div. 1 varisty race. With no one left to challenge her, Curtin cruised to a stellar win in 17 minutes, 43.55 seconds on the rolling 3.1-mile layout. “I wanted to go out and get a good time,” Curtin said. “I felt really comfortable after that first mile, and I started to pick it up.” Newton South’s Rebecca Grusby ran well to take second in 18:26.77, and Eve Driver of Wellesley was third in 19:10.64. Abby Fisher (fourth, 19:29.17) led Billerica to the team title with 87 points. In the Div. 1 boys race, Peabody’s Marcelo Rocha and Tom D’Anieri of Wellesley ran together early until Rocha surged and was clear by the mile. He continued picking up the pace and stayed just ahead of D’Anieri for a fast 15:36.07 win. D’Anieri never faltered and finished five seconds back in 15:41.18. Cambridge placed five runners in the top 20 for the 41-point win. Rocha, one of the preseason favorites to capture the Div. 1 state title, tried to feel out the tough field. “I was trying to go out and see where I am compared to last year,” he said. “It felt good. I still have a lot more work to do. Hopefully, if I’m injury-free, I’ll keep improving.” In Div. 2 boys, Newburyport’s Jack Carleo ran alongside teammate Joseph Mulvar and Norton’s Chris Wren through a controlled 5:05 first mile before surging ahead halfway through to take the lead for good. The junior was well clear of the field at 2 miles (10:14) and simply cruised the final mile for the win. Carleo was more than seven seconds in front of Molvar (16:29.20) at the finish. Wren finished a solid third with his 16:38.52. “I made a move at the beginning of the second loop,” Carleo said. “I looked back a couple of times to see if there was anybody coming.” Michael Weidenbruch finished seventh in 16:50.13 to lead Marblehead to the team title with 68 points, well ahead of Wakefield’s 100 points and Newburyport’s 117. Sophomore Stephanie Casaletto of Austin Prep dueled with Ipswich standout Emily DeMarco at the halfway point before switching gears to break away to a 19:04.18 win in the Div. 2 girls event. Teammate Sarah Oliver clocked 19:12.29 for second and DeMarco claimed the bronze medal with her 19:24.18. Casaletto took DeMarco’s move very seriously. “Emily DeMarco is such a good runner, and she passed me,” she said. ‘I don’t know. I just had a little bit more and went for it.” Old Rochester was the team champion with 71 points, beating Westwood (107) and Newburyport (115)."
424,"Private cars will not be allowed at Hevron Slichot events this year. The decision was made by the Israel Defense Forces and Hevron municipality due to the expected high number of attendees, and the limited space in the city. The IDF is planning on providing transportation to and from the event for those who do not have their own means of transportation.","In light of the women’s slichot (repentence liturgy) event near Hevron’s Me’arat Hamachpela (Cave of the Patriarchs) later on Sunday, private cars will not be allowed in the area as of 5:30 p.m. except for vehicles belonging to residents and those working at the event. Alternate parking will be provided. Free public buses will also be available."
425,"The cheer squad and dance team from Sioux Falls had a great showing at the Brookings competition 13 hours ago. The cheer squad came in 2nd place and the dance team took 3rd in their division. It was a day full of high energy and tough competition, but the Sioux Falls teams held their own and came out victorious. Led by Coach Smith, the cheer squad wowed the judges with their impressive stunts, tumbles, and synchronized movements. The squad worked tirelessly in the weeks leading up to the competition, practicing their routine multiple times a week, perfecting every move, and focusing on their team chemistry. All of their hard work paid off when the judges announced that they had come in 2nd place. ""We're ecstatic,"" said Coach Smith. ""The team put in a lot of hard work to get to this point, and it feels great to see it all pay off."" The dance team, meanwhile, had their own set of challenges to overcome. Led by Coach Johnson, the dancers had to focus on their timing, precision, and fluidity of movement. They practiced for hours every day, working on their choreography and fine-tuning their routines. Despite the stiff competition, they managed to capture the judges' attention and secured 3rd place in their division. ""We're incredibly proud of what we accomplished today,"" said Coach Johnson. ""The girls put in a lot of effort and it showed in their performance."" The Brookings competition was a great opportunity for the Sioux Falls teams to showcase their talent and to measure themselves against some of the best cheer and dance teams in the region. The competition was fierce, and there were a lot of strong teams that participated. But the Sioux Falls teams didn't let that intimidate them. Instead, they channeled that energy into their performances and came out on top. The competition was a great learning experience for all involved. Coach Smith and Coach Johnson said they would take back what they learned to the gym and practice field to make their teams even stronger. They noted that they would work on improving their routines, sharpening their skills, and building up their endurance. For many of the cheer and dance team members, the competition was something they had been looking forward to for a long time. It was an opportunity to showcase their talent and to bond as a team. They were thrilled with the results and said it was an experience they would never forget. The Sioux Falls cheer squad and dance team definitely proved themselves at the Brookings competition 13 hours ago. Their hard work and dedication paid off in a big way, and they came home with a strong showing. It's clear that the future is bright for these teams, and we can't wait to see what they have in store for us next.","Katee Lane and the Lady Lynx cheer team added four more girls to their routine, and the extra bodies on the floor resulted in a second place finish at the Brookings Invite on Saturday. The extra help was brought in to create a more visual presence to the cheer and partner stunts, Lane said. “I was very proud of the way the girls handed their nerves and excitement during the routine,” Lane said. “There are a few more adjustments we will need to make before our BV Invite and then we are ready for ESD, Metro, and state.” Brandon Valley’s dance team placed third behind champion Sioux Falls Washington and runner-up Sioux Falls Lincoln. The Lady Lynx took second in jazz, third in kick and placed sixth in the pom division. BV head coach Tracy Kuhn said she saw huge improvement in her team’s jazz performance, “Our jazz routine was a huge improvement for their second time and will continue to be competitive, and it’s going to be our strongest routine this season if we can correct some timing and technical issues,” she said. Kuhn said there is still some work to be done in their pom and kick routines. “We are not getting the results we should from the judges in our pom routine. It is packed with difficulty and scoring is not reflecting this, therefore we will be working on some changes to clean it up,” she said. “And our kick routine, although very unique and full of sass, is not a judge’s favorite, so we will be making some overall improvements to this routine and will be excited for a strong showing at our home invite.” After competing Tuesday at the Huron Invitational, both cheer and dance programs will prepare for the upcoming BV Invite, which starts at 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 6.

427,"Celebrity Big Brother 2015: 6 of the Best Fake Evictions Ever When it comes to television reality shows, nothing is ever really as it seems. And Celebrity Big Brother is no different; in fact, it's known for its dramatic plot twists, including fake evictions. Here are six of the best fake evictions from the 2015 season of the hit show: 1. Alexander O'Neal During the second week of the show, Alexander O'Neal was ""evicted"" after being nominated alongside Nadia Sawalha. However, he was actually sent to a secret room where he lived for three days, watching the rest of the housemates and even being able to communicate with them via a teleprompter. 2. Kavana Kavana was ""evicted"" during the fifth week of the show, but instead of leaving for good, he was sent to the ""Celebrity Big Brother Bolt Hole"" where he was able to spy on the other housemates and gather information that he could use to his advantage later on in the competition. 3. Chloe Goodman During the same week as Kavana's ""eviction,"" Chloe Goodman was also ""evicted,"" but she was actually sent to the Diary Room where she was able to watch the other housemates bad-mouth her behind her back. 4. Perez Hilton Love him or hate him, the flamboyant blogger and media personality made for great reality TV. During the seventh week of the show, he was ""evicted"" and sent to a secret room where he was able to watch the other housemates and even control aspects of the house, like deciding which song they would wake up to in the morning. 5. Cami Li Cami Li was ""evicted"" during the tenth week of the show, only to be sent to the ""Celebrity Big Brother Bunker"" where she could watch the rest of the housemates and even control some aspects of the house, like ordering pizza and Chinese food. 6. Katie Hopkins One of the most controversial housemates of the season, Katie Hopkins was ""evicted"" during the final week of the show, but instead of leaving the house, she was sent to a secret room where she was able to watch the rest of the final unfold and even cast a vote for who she wanted to win. These fake evictions not only added drama and suspense to the show, but they also allowed viewers to see a different side of the housemates as they reacted to their friends leaving the house. And while they may have been fake, they were definitely some of the most memorable moments of the season.","Big Brother has sprung the old “fake eviction” twist on contestants and viewers too many times over the last decade or so. You know the drill by now – a housemate or two is booted out of the main house into a secret place where they spy on their hopefully unsuspecting former room-mates. Celebrity Big Brother presenters Rylan Clark and Emma Willis (Ian West/PA) This twist has become more predictable than a sob story in X Factor, so tonight on Channel 5, for the first time ever, the rest of the housemates will be in on the joke. They will know from the start that it’s all fake. To celebrate this deliciously devious turn, we look back at some of our favourite fake evictions from both the celeb and non-celeb versions of the show. 1. Michelle Bass and Emma Greenwood. Emma Greenwood (left) and Michelle Bass (Yui Mok/PA) The first-ever fake eviction came during Big Brother 5 when Michelle and Emma were voted into a bedsit. They spied on the house and played pranks on their fellow housemates, including turning off the hot water every time Victor Ebuwa took a shower. However, Emma heard Victor slating her and when she confronted him about it, a huge fight kicked off. Promoted stories Security guards intervened, the police were called and producers took the show off-air. Emma was moved back to the bedsit and then promptly evicted for real. 2. Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt. Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt (Ian West/PA) Speidi, as these spouses are collectively known, quickly established themselves as public enemy number one during Celebrity Big Brother 11 thanks to refusals to take part in certain tasks, diva-like threats to call their lawyers and numerous heated confrontations with fellow housemates, especially eventual winner Rylan Clark (at that time, best known for The X Factor). When the Americans were given a secret mission to stage a fake walk-out, the other housemates easily believed they’d finally quit the show. However, Speidi lived in luxury in Big Brother’s pimped-out basement, listening to every bad word said about them by the other stars. Their eventual return to the main house was TV gold. 3. Charley Uchea. Charley Uchea (Joel Ryan/PA) Self-styled, argumentative south London “it-girl” Charley was fake evicted during Big Brother 8 as part of the show’s Fake Week theme. The best part of the Londoner’s bogus departure came when she emerged from the house to silence: “What’s going on guys? Where’s the cheers, man?” she asked. Charley’s “eviction interview” by then-presenter Davina McCall was watched by her stunned housemates before she went back into the house. 4. Marc O’Neill. Marc O’Neill (Channel 5/PA) As far as his fellow housemates were concerned, Big Brother 16′s Marc was loud, opinionated and annoying. In other words, he was the perfect fake eviction choice. Marc joined legendary Big Brother housemates Nikki Grahame, Helen Wood and Brian Bello in the “bunker”, where they all secretly spied on the shenanigans and exerted sole control over nominations. After listening in on private conversations, Harry Amelia Martin was chosen to face the public vote. 5. Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace. Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace (Yui Mok/PA) The most memorable moment of Aisleyne’s fake eviction? She cried enough tears to fill the Thames. This Big Brother 7 star was secretly moved to the House Next Door, with the remaining housemates believing she’d been evicted. Aisleyne was joined by five new housemates and, as part of a task, chose four to join her in the main house. However, the then-glamour model collapsed in tears after facing a final choice of evicting either Jonathan Leonard or Spiral Coroner. Aisleyne saved Spiral, and if you listen closely, you will still hear her crying over her decision to evict Jonathan. 6. Casey Batchelor and Lee Ryan. Casey Batchelor and Lee Ryan (Ian West/PA) During Celebrity Big Brother 13, the overplayed fake eviction became mesmerising viewing for the first time in ages thanks to Blue singer Lee’s horrid, torrid love triangle. The pop star had flirted with 34GG-sized glamour model Casey before transferring his affections to American actress Jasmine Waltz, rubbing his new-found attraction to her in poor Casey’s face. Ouch. That was bad enough, but then the dastardly voting public promptly forced Lee and Casey to spend time alone together in an even smaller space. It made for cringe-inducing viewing, but Big Brother fans got what they wanted. Share article If tonight’s fake eviction is anything like these gems, we’re in for a treat."

430,"Munich, Germany has been rocked by rival migrant demos as tensions continue to rise across Europe. On one side, a group of refugees gathered to support Germany's open-door policy, while on the other, far-right nationalists congregated to protest against increasing numbers of migrants arriving in the country. The scenes in Munich highlight the growing social and political division over Europe's migrant crisis. It has led to a polarized debate that has pitted those who advocate compassion and tolerance against those who call for stricter border controls and greater national sovereignty. As the immigration crisis continues to exert a tremendous strain on host countries throughout the continent, tensions are rising. Divided opinions are rampant, making it difficult to establish a united course of action for how to address the crisis. With several European countries such as Bulgaria struggling with the arrival of migrants at their borders, it remains to be seen for how long the migrant issue will continue to test the unity and stability of the European Union.","cture: AFP Munich. Tens of thousands of Europeans hit the streets Saturday in both support and opposition to incoming refugees, as overwhelmed authorities in the German city of Munich pleaded for help in accommodating a fresh wave of arrivals, AFP reports. With Germany seen as the promised land by many of those seeking safe haven in Europe, more than 9,000 migrants poured into the Bavarian capital on Saturday alone. More were expected to arrive overnight, prompting local officials to warn the southern city was being stretched to the limit and would struggle to find beds for all the newcomers. As the continent scrambles to respond to the biggest movement of people since World War II, sharp divisions have emerged between the European Union's 28 member states, at both a government level and on the streets. © 2015 All rights reserved.

431,"Volkswagen, the world's largest car maker, is back in hot water after a recent revelation has cast a dark shadow on the company's integrity. The news outlet, ""Chicago Tribune"", dubbed this event as ""Volkswagen's Whizzinator moment"", a reference to a famous incident in sports history. Here's what we know so far. In 2006, NFL player Onterrio Smith was caught with a device called the ""Whizzinator"", a fake penis device containing clean urine which players used to cheat drug tests. Smith's career took a nosedive, and the ""Whizzinator"" became a cultural touchstone for cheating scandals. Now, Volkswagen seems to have had its own ""Whizzinator moment."" Last week, a German documentary, ""The Volkswagen Conspiracy"", revealed that the company allegedly sponsored a study that involved exposing monkeys and humans to diesel exhaust fumes. The study, conducted in 2014, was meant to prove that modern diesel engines were cleaner than older models, but what ensued has put the company back in the crosshairs of the public. The documentary claims that the study exposed 10 monkeys to fumes from a diesel Volkswagen Beetle in an enclosed chamber. The monkeys reportedly showed no ill effects from the exposure, but the study has created a public relations nightmare for Volkswagen. Animal rights activists have condemned the study, and Volkswagen's reputation has taken a hit. According to The Guardian, the study was conducted by the European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector (EUGT), an organization funded by Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler. What's more, the documentary alleges that the EUGT has had a cozy relationship with the German government, which may have influenced regulatory decisions about diesel engines. Volkswagen's response to the revelations was swift, with the company's CEO, Matthias Müller, calling the study ""repulsive"" and ""unethical."" The company also announced that it would launch an internal investigation, and has suspended its chief lobbyist, Thomas Steg. Steg reportedly knew about the study in 2016, but did not inform senior management. This is not the first time Volkswagen has been embroiled in a scandal. In 2015, the company was caught using ""defeat devices"" in its diesel engines, which allowed the cars to cheat emissions tests. The scandal cost Volkswagen billions of dollars in fines and settlements, and damaged the company's reputation. This new scandal has put Volkswagen in a tough spot. The company has been working to rebuild its image, and has invested billions of dollars in electric vehicles and other new technologies. But this latest revelation has dealt a blow to the company's credibility, and may make it harder for Volkswagen to move forward. In conclusion, Volkswagen's Whizzinator moment has put the company back in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. The alleged study involving monkeys and diesel exhaust fumes paints a disturbing picture of the company's ethics and values. Volkswagen has a lot of work to do if it wants to regain the trust of consumers and regulators. The fallout from this scandal will likely be felt for years to come.","Dear Volkswagen: I want my money back. Two years ago, when I went shopping for a new car for the first time in 10 years, I ended up buying one of yours: A 2014 Passat TDI. Part of your Clean Diesel lineup, the sales manager told me, it was a car that would allow me to be environmentally responsible while enjoying superior fuel economy. I actually thought she was serious. Now I know better. Turns out the impressive emissions numbers you touted in your ads and showrooms were fraudulent. It wasn't innovative engineering that made those numbers possible, but some software sleight-of-hand that allowed your clean diesel engines to enable emissions controls when government regulators were watching and turn them off during ordinary driving. I'm not an engineer, but I recognize the technology you employed to disguise your cars' exhaust fumes as a variation on the tactic parolees use to conceal drug use from their parole officers. A few years ago, I wrote about a product called the Whizzinator, which was designed, like Volkswagen's emissions software, primarily to deceive government regulators. Available in a variety of flesh tones designed to accommodate every (male) customer, the Whizzinator used a plastic penis to deliver untainted urine from a concealed reservoir to a specimen cup under the scrutiny of vigilant parole officers, bypassing the test subject's own organs and any incriminating waste products they might house. Substitute some sophisticated software code for the Whizzinator's crude plumbing and you have the tactic Volkswagen used to deceive EPA officials testing the automakers' vehicles for illegal levels of air pollution. When the EPA called foul on your company last week, I hesitated to believe its allegations. After all, it was my own judgment the agency was implicating as well as yours. As a journalist, I take some pride in my capacity to discern when someone is misleading me, whether unwittingly or deliberately. So I waited all weekend for your official response, hoping Volkswagen would provide evidence that the EPA was mistaken or, at the very least, that the company, too, had been deceived by a handful of renegade employees. But when CEO Martin Winterkorn finally broke his silence Sunday, he offered no extenuating circumstances that might mitigate the company's culpability for the clean diesel hoax. “I personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public,” Winterkorn, who resigned Wednesday, said in a statement. Like most apologies for cheating, your CEO's would have been more impressive if he'd made it before he was caught with his pants down. The bottom line, then, is that you lied to me and everyone else who purchased one of your clean diesel vehicles. I then amplified your deception, however unwittingly, by boasting that my new vehicle was not only more fuel-efficient than most of neighbors' but cleaner as well. And for that, you owe me more than a belated admission of guilt. I don't know if I'll ever receive a penny of compensation for that deception, or its negative impact on the resale value of my now 20-month-old fraud-mobile. But I know I've purchased my last Volkswagen vehicle. Whizz me once, shame on you; Whizz me twice, shame on me. Tribune Content Agency Brian Dickerson is a columnist for the Detroit Free Press. "

433,"The New South Wales Bar Association has urged the legal profession to adopt national targets for briefing women barristers across the country. According to the NSW Bar Association President Tim Game SC, there is a need to redouble efforts to ensure gender equity in the profession. He said that while progress has been made in recent years, there were still barriers preventing female barristers from advancing in the field. The NSW Bar Association is proposing three achievable targets to ensure increased representation of women barristers in the legal profession. The first target is for law firms and government agencies to brief female counsel in at least 30% of cases by 2025. The second target is for female barristers to be appointed as lead counsel in at least 20% of cases by 2025. The third target is for women to make up at least 30% of all senior counsel by 2025. In a statement, Game said that ""the targets are based on evidence that shows increased diversity in the legal profession leads to better decision-making, improved work practices, better financial performance, and importantly, improved access to justice"". The NSW Bar Association is calling on all state and territory legal associations, the Law Council of Australia, and the Australian Bar Association to endorse the targets and work towards their implementation. Currently, women make up only a small percentage of senior barristers in Australia. According to the Law Society of NSW, women account for 25% of barristers in the state, but only 10% of senior counsel. Game said that the lack of diversity in the legal profession was not just a matter of fairness and justice, but also one of economic necessity. ""Clients today demand diverse teams of lawyers who can provide a range of perspectives and solutions. To remain competitive, the legal profession must embrace diversity and actively work to remove barriers to entry and advancement,"" he said. The NSW government, through its Office for Women, has endorsed the NSW Bar Association's proposal. Minister for Women Bronnie Taylor said that the government was committed to achieving gender equity in all areas, including the legal profession. ""The targets set by the Bar Association are ambitious but achievable. The government fully supports these targets and is committed to working with the legal profession to ensure they are met,"" she said. The Law Society of NSW has also endorsed the proposal, with President Juliana Warner saying that ""we must strive for a legal profession that is reflective of the broader community it serves. This requires progress towards gender equity and diversity at all levels"". The proposal has been welcomed by female barristers across the country. Senior barrister and Chair of the Women Barristers Forum, Sophie Callan SC, said that ""we need to ensure that women are well-represented at all levels of the legal profession. The NSW Bar Association's proposal is an important step towards achieving this goal"". The NSW Bar Association's proposal comes as the legal profession faces ongoing scrutiny over issues of gender equity and diversity. Earlier this year, a survey by the Law Society of NSW revealed that nearly half of all female lawyers in the state had experienced sexual harassment in the workplace. The NSW Bar Association's proposal is a positive step towards addressing these challenges and promoting gender equity in the legal profession. If adopted, the targets could help to create a more diverse and inclusive legal profession that better serves the needs of all Australians.","They are graduating from NSW law schools in numbers greater than their male counterparts, but women still make up just over 20 per cent of barristers, spend fewer hours in court and get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars less in fees. They are graduating from NSW law schools in numbers greater than their male counterparts, but women still make up just over 20 per cent of barristers, spend fewer hours in court and get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars less in fees. Now the NSW Bar Association is proposing national targets and reporting requirements to tackle ""head-on"" the lack of gender diversity at the bar and create a level playing-field for men and women. A working party commissioned by the association's president, Jane Needham SC, has recommended new targets for briefing women barristers that would apply to law firms with at least 25 lawyers and all government agencies. In a report released this week, the working group says that by July 1, 2017, the firms and agencies should give 10 per cent of all briefs to women silks. The target rises to 20 per cent of all briefs given to junior counsel with at least five years' experience, and 35 per cent of briefs given to less experienced juniors. Source: NSW Bar Association survey, 2014 Design: Michael Howard Silks, meanwhile, should try to ensure women appear as their juniors in 23 per cent of matters requiring a court appearance. ""It's not really asking all that much of people, even though it looks quite radical on its face,"" Ms Needham. ""The figures are very clear that women are not being given the same opportunities as men."" Ms Needham said the targets had to be ""fairly low"" because women currently make up just under 10 per cent of silks at the NSW bar and 23 per cent of juniors, or 21 per cent of barristers overall. This is despite the fact they now make up more than 66 per cent of law graduates. The working group, led by Sydney silks Arthur Moses and Kate Eastman, said the disparity between the fees earned by male and female barristers would be ""unacceptable in any other industry"". Source: Beyond the Statistical Gap: 2009 Court Appearance Survey, Law Council of Australia Design: Michael Howard The average gross annual fees for men at the NSW bar are $437,450 compared with $269,958 for women, a disparity of 38 per cent. Based on available figures, this appears to be among the biggest pay gaps in the country. The federal Workplace Gender Equality Agency reported in August that the financial and insurance services industry had the biggest gender pay gap at 30.5 per cent but it did not report specifically on barristers' pay. The Bar Association's working group noted the pay figures must be read in context, given men were generally older and had been established at the NSW bar longer than women. A 2009 report by the Law Council of Australia found only 5.8 per cent of appearances by silks in the Federal Court were by women. The average length of the hearing for women silks in that court was just 2.7 hours, compared with 119.7 hours for men. If adopted in NSW and around the country, the changes would update the Law Council's equitable briefing policy. Firms and agencies would report annually on the number of men and women barristers briefed. Mr Moses said the existing policy had ""failed and needs to be revisited"" and the disparity in pay between men and women at the bar ""cannot be explained away"". Equitable Briefing Working Group report, 2015 Design: Michael Howard ""The simple fact is that the majority of law graduates for a substantial period of time have been women - indeed, women have been overwhelmingly the best and brightest of the graduates,"" Mr Moses said. ""In order for the bar to remain strong and independent it needs not only to recruit but retain more women."" The Law Council's president-elect, Clayton Utz partner Stuart Clark, said a national briefing policy was required because many law firms briefing barristers operated across at least two jurisdictions. The NSW Bar Association was charged with revising the policy. ""What we've said, importantly, is things that don't get measured don't get done, so it's absolutely critical that you have sensible targets,"" Mr Clark said. ""There's absolute agreement that the time for talking is over and now is the time for action."" The recommendations will be discussed at a meeting of all associations and the Law Council in the coming months. If NSW is any guide, the proposal is likely to encounter some resistance. At a meeting on August 13, three male silks on the NSW Bar Association's governing body - Paul Menzies, QC, Alan Sullivan, QC, and Jeffrey Phillips, SC - dissented from a resolution for the report to be provided to the Law Council of Australia. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald."
434,"Leinster Rugby's former captain, Kevin McLaughlin, has announced his retirement from professional rugby due to ongoing issues related to concussion. The flanker's decision comes after suffering several head injuries throughout his career, the most recent of which occurred in September 2015. While McLaughlin had made a successful return to playing shortly after, he suffered another concussion in November and has been experiencing ongoing symptoms since. Speaking about his decision, the 31-year-old stated: ""It is with great sadness that I am announcing my retirement from professional rugby. I have loved every minute of my time in the game and it is a decision that has not come easily, but one that I believe is the right thing for me and my future health."" ""I have experienced several concussions throughout my career, and while I was able to recover from some of them quickly, others have led to ongoing symptoms that have impacted my daily life. I have spoken to medical professionals and consulted with Leinster's medical team, and we have all agreed that it is in my best interest to retire from the game."" McLaughlin rose through the ranks of Leinster Rugby, debuting for the province in 2007. He went on to make 109 appearances for the team, earning himself the captaincy for the 2013-14 season. He also earned two caps for the Irish international side in 2012. Leinster Rugby released a statement following McLaughlin's announcement, praising his incredible work ethic and dedication to the sport, while acknowledging the difficult decision he has made. ""Kevin has been an outstanding professional throughout his time at Leinster Rugby, both on and off the field. He has always displayed an incredible work ethic and willingness to improve, and his leadership qualities have been invaluable to the team. The decision he has made is a tough one, but it is one that we fully support. We wish Kevin every success in the next chapter of his life."" The issue of concussion in rugby has become an increasingly important topic in recent years, with the sport's governing bodies taking a more proactive approach to player welfare. McLaughlin's retirement highlights the need for continued awareness and action surrounding concussion prevention and management.","Former Ireland flanker Kevin McLaughlin is the latest rugby star forced to retire due to concussion. The 31-year-old suffered a concussion in Leinster's season-opening Pro12 clash with Edinburgh and has since been advised to retire. McLaughlin's premature retirement follows hot on the heels of former Wales flanker Jonathan Thomas quitting the sport after contracting epilepsy due to repetitive head trauma. Governing body World Rugby have admitted looking into potential law changes around tackling in a bid to improve the sport's safety. ""It is upsetting and frustrating to have to retire when I feel I have so much left to give but it is the right decision and I am glad that our medical staff were so proactive in encouraging me to see a neurologist,"" McLaughlin told Leinster's website. ""The support I have received from the club and my team-mates has been incredible and will help to soften the blow of having to having to retire from the game I love. ""From a rugby perspective I have no regrets. ""I was lucky enough to be involved in Leinster throughout a very successful and rewarding period during which I have learned a lot about life and made lifelong friends."" McLaughlin won eight caps for Ireland but also featured in Leinster's 2011 and 2012 Heineken Cup final victories. The combative flanker had stepped up to captain Leinster at the start of the season in the absence of number eight Jamie Heaslip, away at the World Cup with Ireland. Leinster lost their opening Pro12 match 16-9 at Edinburgh on September 4, and after suffering a head injury McLaughlin has now been forced to retire. "" Having sustained a concussion in the opening Pro12 game against Edinburgh Kevin was referred by the Leinster Rugby medical team to a leading neurologist, due to concerns about his increasing susceptibility to concussion and the length of recovery,"" read Leinster's statement. Promoted stories ""Following tests it was recommended that it would be in his best long-term interests to stop playing."" Head coach Leo Cullen admitted he hopes McLaughlin will continue to help Leinster within their back-room set-up. Share article ""Kevin is a very popular member of the squad both on and off the pitch and thankfully he's open to the possibility of helping out with us behind the scenes certainly in the short term and again I think that's an indication of the esteem with which he is held within the group,"" said Cullen. ""Kevin is one of the most selfless players in our squad. He is the consummate pro and always put the team first."""

436,"Canada's uranium reserves remain a ""strategic asset"" that the National Democratic Party (NDP) will not reverse, according to party leader Thomas Mulcair. Mulcair, a former federal environment official, spoke at a mining conference in Toronto on Thursday, where he discussed his party's stance on uranium mining and exportation. He stated that while the NDP supports responsible resource development, it recognizes the importance of Canada's nuclear industry and the role uranium plays within it. The comments come amid growing concerns over the future of Canadian uranium mining, as well as the country's energy and natural resource sectors more broadly. A 2019 report from the Canadian Institute for Climate Choices found that shifting global demand for energy and climate targets could threaten the viability of the sector if action is not taken. Mulcair specifically addressed the issue of Paladin Energy Ltd's exemption from Canada's foreign ownership rules back in 2014, a decision made under the previous Conservative government. He stated that while he disagreed with the exception, the NDP would not seek to reverse it if elected to power. Canada is the world's second-largest uranium producer after Kazakhstan, with Saskatchewan home to some of the largest uranium mines in the world. The country's uranium exports totaled C$1.5 billion ($1.2 billion) in 2019, according to government data. Mulcair's remarks indicate that while the NDP may push for greater regulation and oversight of uranium mining and exportation, it does not support any measures that would jeopardize the future of the industry in Canada.","By Rod Nickel WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Canada's New Democratic Party views the country's uranium as a ""strategic asset,"" and would not reverse a rare government decision to allow foreign ownership of a proposed mine, leader Tom Mulcair said on Thursday. The uranium industry is unpopular in Quebec, the NDP's stronghold heading into next month's election. But it is a key part of the economy in Saskatchewan, where the party hopes to add support. The governing Conservatives in June made an exception to the country's longstanding policy requiring uranium mines to be majority-owned by Canadian companies, and approved an application by Australia's Paladin Energy Ltd. If the left-wing NDP forms government after the Oct. 19 election, it would not change that decision, Mulcair said during a Winnipeg campaign stop. ""The federal government has a responsibility to keep a very close eye on"" uranium production, he said. ""It's a strategic asset, but the (Paladin decision) seems to have opened the possibility for better investment."" Restrictions on foreign companies have reduced opportunities for companies, including Denison Mines Corp and Fission Uranium Corp, to find buyers for their planned uranium projects in Canada, the world's second-largest producer. The radioactive metal produces fuel for reactors. The Conservative government has said Paladin was unable to find a Canadian partner for its project in Newfoundland and Labrador. Saskatchewan-based Cameco Corp is the main owner of all of the country's uranium mines. Continued..."

The Curry household is one that basketball fans around the world are very familiar with, as both Steph and Seth have made major impacts on the sport. Dell, however, sets the record straight by revealing that he never pressured his sons to follow in his footsteps. ""I told them, enjoy the game, play hard, and let's see where it takes you,"" Dell stated. ""I'm just proud to see that they are doing well and having fun playing the game they love."" When asked about the ongoing debate surrounding who is the better shooter between Steph and himself, Dell laughed and explained the obvious: ""It's just like running a race, you don't want them to beat you. As you get older, you realize it's time to pass the torch. And Steph has certainly done that."" But it's not just basketball that excites the Curry family - they also share a love for golf. In fact, Dell recalls one particular round that he played with none other than former President Barack Obama. ""It was an honor and a privilege to meet him, and to play golf with him was a great experience,"" Dell reminisced. ""He's a great golfer and a great guy."" Dell also explained how his sons have a competitive sibling rivalry when it comes to their golf games. ""They're always trying to one-up each other on the golf course,"" he said. ""It's a good and healthy rivalry though."" Aside from his well-known sons and his love for golf, Dell's NBA career was also a topic of discussion during the interview. One of his proudest moments was being recognized as the NBA Sixth Man of the Year in 1994, and he also reflected on some of his most memorable moments, such as playing alongside Michael Jordan and being a part of the inaugural Toronto Raptors team. In the end, Dell knows that he has had a blessed life, one that has allowed him to be a part of so many memorable experiences. ""I have been fortunate enough to do so many things in my life, and to be a part of the NBA and have two sons who play in the league, it's just incredible,"" he stated. ""I can't wait to see what the future holds for us all.""

439,"The winners of the 18th Annual Business Day BASA Awards, partnered by Hollard, were recently honoured for their outstanding collaborations between business and the arts. The awards, which celebrate partnerships that demonstrate mutual benefit and innovation in a range of categories from visual arts and design to music and theatre, are hosted annually by Business and Arts South Africa (BASA). This year, the awards ceremony was held virtually due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but the level of creativity, impact and commitment to arts and culture from the nominees remained as strong as ever. One of the big winners on the night was the ABSA Gallery, which took home two awards for its collaborations with different artists and designers. In the Visual Art Partnership Award category, ABSA Gallery was recognised for its partnership with the Marianne Fassler Studio on the exhibition ""Effloresce"". The exhibition, which was a mix of textiles, photography, digital print and multimedia was hailed for its use of technology and traditional art forms. ABSAs collaboration with the Jennifer Morrison Art Advisory on the exhibition, ""Stream of Consciousness: The Minimalism of The Grid"", also won the Arts and the Environment Award. Another winner on the night was Aardklop National Arts Festival, which won the First Time Sponsor Award for its partnership with the North-West University, where a group of students were given the opportunity to create an illuminated art installation as part of the festival. The festival's chairman, Willem van der Walt, said the award was an honour and would serve as motivation to continue generating new and exciting arts collaborations. ""We are extremely proud of this achievement,"" he said. ""It is especially gratifying to know that, through our support of the arts, we are making a positive impact on the development of creative and cultural industries in South Africa."" The SAMRO Foundation, which supports the development of music and the arts in South Africa, also received recognition for its partnership with the Gauteng Philharmonic Orchestra. The collaboration won the Increasing Access to the Arts Award for its efforts to bring classical music to communities who otherwise may not have had access to it. Another notable winner was the design firm, Studio Muti, whose collaboration with the band, Beatenberg, won the Innovation Award. The collaboration saw the creation of a custom typeface and album artwork for the band's latest release. The innovation award is given to partnerships that push boundaries, take risks and challenge conventions. Studio Muti's work with Beatenberg was noted for its boldness and use of creative typography and design elements. This year's judging panel was made up of renowned figures in the arts and business communities, including artist and author, Bontle Senne, and Hollard's CEO, Saks Ntombela. Speaking at the awards ceremony, Ntombela praised the nominees and winners for their contributions to the South African arts landscape, emphasising the importance of continued collaboration between the arts and business sectors. ""The arts play a critical role in enriching our communities and driving cultural and educational development,"" he said. ""These collaborations are key to ensuring that the arts continue to thrive and contribute to our society and economy."" Overall, the 18th Annual Business Day BASA Awards, partnered by Hollard, were a timely reminder of the power of collaboration and its potential to drive innovation, creativity and positive change in society. As South Africa faces new challenges in the wake of the pandemic, these partnerships will be more important than ever to reignite the country's cultural and economic vitality.","The foyer of the Constitutional Court of South Africa proved a fitting context for the eleven diverse business and arts partnerships honoured at the 18th Annual Business Day BASA Awards, partnered by Hollard, on 21 September 2015. Surrounded by artworks from the Constitutional Court Art Collection (CCAC), the winners in the eleven judged categories were celebrated, along with the winners of the event's four special awards selected at the discretion of the Business and Arts South Africa (BASA) Board. Each winner received a unique sculpture by renowned artist, Collen Maswanganyi, inspired by the theme of transformation. Maswanganyi created a ""family"" of pieces, with each sculpture representing a different family member who has undergone, or is busy undergoing, a transformation of his or her own. ""We'd like to congratulate all the winners tonight,"" commented Michelle Constant, BASA CEO. ""By celebrating these business and arts partnerships, we are also paying tribute to the power of the arts, in all its diversity, to be a tool of transformation."" Heidi Brauer, Chief Marketing Officer at Hollard, comments: ""It made such beautiful sense to celebrate these society-changing projects in a place that holds us to the highest possible standards of commitment to building a better South Africa for everyone. We salute each of the finalists and applaud all of the winners."" Winners ranged from small projects to large-scale ones, and encompass many different aspects of the arts. For instance, the winner of the First Time Sponsor Award was the partnership between the Recycling and Economic Development Initiative of South Africa (REDISA) and the Puku Children's Literature Foundation. The partnership saw REDISA sponsoring the Puku Story Festival in Grahamstown and Puku Story Competition for teenagers to write stories in isiXhosa with an environmental theme. This year's International Sponsorship Award was won by Redefine Properties Limited for supporting the Buskaid Soweto String Ensemble's tour to the UK, a resounding success on many different levels. The Sponsorship In Kind Award went to Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr Inc., proud partner of The Magnet Theatre Educational Trust, united by a mission to facilitate access to avenues of empowerment and transformation for historically disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. In particular, the partnership culminated in Magnet's successful application for Section 18A status, contributing to improved sustainability. The partnership between MayFord Seeds and Apollo Music Trust, Symphony Choir of Johannesburg, and Last Night of the Proms, won the Arts and the Environment Award, supported by Nedbank. (See below for a full list of winners.) The 18th Annual Business Day BASA Awards, partnered by Hollard, commissioned a performance by Anthea Moys, with Lavendhri Arumugam, Dion Monti, and Wits School of Arts Fine Art students, titled The Window Workers. ""The conceptual foundation of this piece builds on notions of 'transformation in action - the idea that transformation takes work, and working together,"" explained Moys.

Before research, the writer believed all of the categories would fall under a program called Sexual Addictions Anonymous.

The following paper will be formatted to answer questions regarding the nature, places, purpose, nearest location, and latest news from the organization. Who Attends the Meetings Sexual Compulsives Anonymous (SCA), has two sets of meetings ones that are open, and ones that are closed.

The closed meetings require the person to not necessarily identify as a sexual compulsive person but meet the following criteria. “A ""closed"" meeting allows attendance and participation only by SCA members or those who think they might qualify for membership. Remember, the Third Tradition states that, ""The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop having compulsive sex.” (SCA Recovery Org.)

442,"Xi Jinping, the President of China, has defended his country's interventions in the Chinese stock market during his first official visit to the United States. The move comes amid growing concerns over Beijing's economic policies, with many experts accusing China of unfairly manipulating its currency to boost exports. Speaking to a group of American business leaders at a forum in Seattle, Xi said that China's intervention in the stock market was necessary to protect the stability of its financial system. He added that the recent drop in Chinese stocks was only a temporary setback and that the country's long-term economic prospects remained strong. ""China's economy is still operating within a reasonable range, despite downward pressures,"" Xi said. ""The stock market fluctuation is a reflection of the market itself, and we need to have confidence in the market and the people's willingness to invest."" Xi's comments come at a time when many are questioning China's ability to continue its economic growth in the face of a slowing global economy. Over the past few months, China's gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate has slowed to its lowest level in more than six years, leading many to wonder whether the country is facing a major economic slowdown. Despite these concerns, Xi sought to reassure his American audience that China would continue to be a reliable trading partner and that it remained committed to opening up its economy to foreign investment. ""China will always be a big market for pursuit of business opportunities by American companies,"" Xi said. ""We will never close our door to the outside world, and we will not change our policy of opening up."" However, despite Xi's assurances, many American business leaders remain cautious about investing in China, citing concerns about intellectual property theft, restrictions on foreign investment, and government control over key industries. ""I think that it's a challenging environment for American businesses in China right now,"" said Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Alphabet, Google's parent company, who attended the forum. ""There are a lot of regulations, there are a lot of requirements, there's a lot of control."" Xi also addressed concerns over China's military expansion in the South China Sea, saying that the country had no intention of pursuing militarization in the region. He added that China remained committed to resolving disputes with neighboring countries through peaceful means. ""We hope to manage and control our differences in a constructive way, and resolve disputes through friendly consultation and negotiation,"" he said. Xi's visit to the United States comes at a time of heightened tensions between the two countries, with both sides accusing each other of cyber espionage and other forms of economic espionage. However, despite these tensions, both sides have sought to maintain a cordial relationship, with President Obama hosting Xi for a state dinner at the White House on Friday. Overall, Xi's visit to the United States marks an important milestone in China's efforts to expand its economic and political influence around the world. While many challenges remain for China as it seeks to maintain its economic growth and promote its interests on the global stage, Xi's visit to the United States is a clear indication that the country remains committed to achieving these goals.","Red Sox start game strong but fall to Rays Boston Channel - Wednesday 23rd September, 2015 Mikie Mahtook hit a two-run homer and Matt Moore recovered from a difficult start to strike out seven as the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Boston Red Sox 5-2 on Tuesday ...

443,"As a parent or guardian, it's not uncommon to experience those moments of frustration that come with raising children. Tantrums, meltdowns, and outbursts can feel like an unavoidable part of the journey. But what if there was a way to manage these difficult behaviors in a constructive way? Enter: the ""tantrum place."" A ""tantrum place"" is a designated spot in your home where your child can go to cool off and process their emotions. It doesn't have to be anything fancy- just a quiet corner, a comfortable chair, or even a cozy blanket fort. The key is to make it clear that this is a safe space for your child to work through their feelings, without fear of punishment or retribution. So, how can you implement a ""tantrum place"" in your own home? Here are a few tips: 1. Talk to your child about the purpose of the ""tantrum place."" Explain that it's a spot where they can go to calm down when they're feeling overwhelmed or upset. Reassure them that it's okay to feel big emotions, and that you're there to support them. 2. Choose a location that works for your family. Depending on the age and temperament of your child, you may want to pick a spot that's quiet and private (like a bedroom or a reading nook), or something more active and sensory (like a swing or a trampoline). 3. Make the ""tantrum place"" inviting. Decorate the spot with soft pillows, calming colors, or your child's favorite toys. Consider putting up pictures or posters with positive affirmations, like ""it's okay to make mistakes"" or ""you are loved."" 4. Use the ""tantrum place"" consistently. Whenever your child starts to feel overwhelmed or upset, gently guide them towards the designated spot. Encourage them to take deep breaths or try relaxation techniques like counting or visualization. 5. Follow up with your child once they've had a chance to calm down. Check in and see how they're feeling, and offer support and guidance as needed. The benefits of a ""tantrum place"" are twofold. Not only does it give your child a healthy outlet for their emotions, but it also helps to maintain peace and harmony in your household. Instead of resorting to punishment or anger when your child acts out, you can redirect them towards a positive solution. Plus, over time, your child will learn how to regulate their emotions and self-soothe, which can lead to more positive behavior overall. Of course, a ""tantrum place"" is just one tool in your parenting toolkit. It's important to also set clear boundaries and expectations for your child, and to practice open communication and active listening. But by implementing a ""tantrum place"" in your own home, you'll be taking a proactive step towards creating a more peaceful, harmonious family dynamic. And, who knows- you may even find yourself taking a few deep breaths in the ""tantrum place"" yourself!","Q: Our first, a girl, just turned three and has suddenly started throwing tantrums. She can begin a tantrum when she's alone in her room if something she's playing with doesn't do what she wants it to do. It's as if she is right on the edge of a tantrum all day long. We've started walking on eggshells around her as a result, and we realize we're giving in a lot just to keep the peace. We don't understand how such a happy baby and toddler has become such a malcontent. Nothing has changed in our family situation that might explain it. Can you? A: You're doing what all too many of today's parents tend to do: Instead of trying to solve a behavior problem, you're trying to figure out what has caused it. It's what I call ""thinking psychologically."" And because none of your theories concerning your daughter's tantrums can be either proven or disproven, you're becoming increasingly confused. The inevitable end result of this is a state I refer to as ""disciplinary paralysis."" As you confess, you don't know what to do, you're walking on eggshells, giving in to keep the peace. You're obviously an intelligent person. I shouldn't need to tell you that every time you shut down a tantrum by giving in, you make the problem that much worse. Short-term ""solutions"" make for long-term nightmares. Some children begin throwing tantrums when they're 12 months old; some don't start until they're three; but almost all children go through a phase during which they throw lots of tantrums. Why? Because they believe that what they want, they deserve to have. The ""hump"" of parenting is that of patiently, lovingly, but very firmly and steadfastly teaching a child that reality is not going to cooperate with that narcissistic fantasy. Parents who fail to get over that hump are in for a long haul down a hard road. And a child whose parents fail to get over that hump is in for a very rude awakening if not a very unhappy life. The very simple solution to your daughter's fits is known as the ""tantrum place."" First field-tested on my daughter Amy when she began throwing fits of pique at age three, it has since provided much-appreciated relief to many a parent. Tell your daughter that her temper tantrums are very special things and need a very special place. With Amy, we used a half-bathroom, but any relatively isolated place will do, even a rug. Say, ""The new rule is that when you begin having a tantrum, you have to go to your new tantrum place. If you need help getting there, we will help you. You can scream as long and as loud as you want, but you can't come out until you stop."" At first, she is probably going to come out of her tantrum place before her fit has completely run its course. In that event, just calmly put her back, reminding her of the new rule. The important thing is that you act resolutely so as to send the clear message that her outbursts are not going to determine how the world works. If you are purposeful, you should have a much calmer household in no time. (Visit family psychologist John Rosemond's website at www.johnrosemond.com.)"
444,"The Sydney Swans have been hit with a major setback ahead of their final against Fremantle as star forward Buddy Franklin has been ruled out of the game due to mental health issues. The Swans confirmed the news on Tuesday, stating that Franklin would not play in the crucial clash due to a ""personal matter."" The announcement came as a shock to fans and the wider AFL community, with Franklin widely regarded as one of the best players in the competition. The 34-year-old has been in exceptional form this season and has been a key component of the Swans' impressive campaign. However, the Swans have prioritized the welfare of their player, with head coach John Longmire highlighting the importance of supporting Franklin through his mental health issues. ""Everyone at the club is fully supportive of Buddy's decision to take time away from the game and prioritize his mental health,"" Longmire said. ""We have a duty of care to our players and their health, both physical and mental, is our top priority."" The Swans have a strong record in supporting their players through mental health issues, with Longmire himself speaking openly about his own experience with anxiety and depression. The club has a dedicated mental health program in place, which provides players with access to a range of support services. ""We have a great program in place to support our players through any mental health issues they may face,"" Longmire said. ""We will do whatever we can to support Buddy through this, and he has our full support and understanding."" Despite Franklin's absence, the Swans remain confident of their chances against Fremantle. The team has a deep roster of talented players and has shown great resilience throughout the season. ""Obviously Buddy is a key player for us, but we have a lot of depth and talent in our squad,"" Longmire said. ""We've had players step up throughout the season and we're confident that we can continue that trend."" Franklin's absence will be felt both on and off the field, with the star forward a key figure in the Swans' team culture. However, the Swans will look to rally around their teammate and provide him with the support he needs. ""Our thoughts are with Buddy at this time, and we will do whatever we can to support him through this,"" Longmire said. ""He's a hugely valued member of our team and we will miss him, but his health and wellbeing are the most important things right now."" The AFL community has rallied around Franklin, with many offering their support and well wishes. Mental health issues are a serious concern in elite sport, with a number of high-profile players speaking out about their own struggles in recent years. The Swans have set a strong example in prioritizing the mental health of their players and providing them with the necessary support. Franklin's absence is a reminder of the importance of mental health in sport and reinforces the need for clubs to prioritize the wellbeing of their players. The Swans' final against Fremantle will take place on the weekend, with the team looking to advance to the next round of the finals. While Franklin will be missed, the Swans remain confident of their chances and will look to deliver a strong performance in his absence.","Brisbane Nova radios Ash Bradnam banned from driving over drink driving incident Daily Mail - Tuesday 8th September, 2015 From paddles to Pippin: Apple's attempts to take over the living room revealed as it prepares to unveil TV box that doubles as a games console - and can even switch on your lights ...

446,"Editor's Letter: Coming Back to ‘Buy Black’ As the editor of Talent Management, it is my pleasure to share my thoughts in this letter to our readers. In recent months, we have witnessed an outpouring of support for Black-owned businesses. The call to ‘Buy Black’ has been rising in prominence, with people all over the country realizing the need to invest in and uplift Black entrepreneurs. It is a gratifying sight to see people finally recognizing the value of Black-owned businesses. This support is long overdue, and it is no secret that Black-owned businesses have faced significant hurdles in the past. From discrimination to lack of access to funding and resources, it has been a challenging journey for many entrepreneurs. However, it is encouraging to note that things are changing, and this is reflected in the increasing demand for Black-owned businesses. It is worth noting that the events of 2020 have played a crucial role in increasing awareness and support for Black-owned businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of the global economy, impacting businesses of all sizes across industries. Simultaneously, the Black Lives Matter movement has shone a spotlight on the systemic racism that permeates all aspects of society, including businesses. In light of these events, people are now more aware of the need to create more equitable and inclusive systems that support underrepresented groups. Consumers, too, have a significant role to play in this process. By supporting Black-owned businesses, we can address systemic issues and promote economic equality. Fortunately, there are many ways to support Black-owned businesses, from making intentional purchasing decisions to amplifying their voices on social media. For example, we can make a conscious effort to actively seek out Black-owned businesses when shopping, and prioritize their products and services over others. This kind of intentional support can make a significant difference to Black entrepreneurs, especially during these challenging times. Moreover, as individuals, we can also use our platforms to amplify the voices of Black entrepreneurs, and share their stories with others. By sharing Black-owned businesses on social media, for example, we can increase their visibility and help connect them with potential customers. Of course, these efforts alone are not enough, and we must continue pushing for systemic changes that address the systemic issues that disproportionately affect Black entrepreneurs. For example, we can advocate for policies that increase funding and support for Black-owned businesses, or we can support local organizations that work towards economic equity. As we move forward into the new year, it is essential that we continue to reflect on how we can create more equitable and inclusive systems that support Black-owned businesses. It is time for us to come together and invest in the economic future of our communities. And, as the editor of Talent Management, it is my promise to continue highlighting the stories of Black entrepreneurs and advocating for more equitable systems that provide them with the support they need to succeed. As a society, we must recognize that the wellbeing and prosperity of all members, regardless of race or ethnicity, are intertwined. Supporting Black-owned businesses is an essential step towards creating a more inclusive and just economy. So, let us continue to ‘Buy Black’ and invest in a future that works for us all.","You can learn a lot by eavesdropping on the train. I’ve stumbled onto ideas for columns, broadened my understanding of diversity, economics and myriad other topics, not to mention made new friends. Recently, a couple of those new friends — a husband and wife counseling team — were discussing the husband’s plan for an upcoming men’s church retreat. He was complaining mildly that participants’ desire to relax wasn’t right. He felt they should do something more useful with the time by planning an enrichment event for young men in the church, for example. But if rest and relaxation were paramount, they should at least choose a black-owned venue. He’d even found one — one that his cohorts weren’t pleased with because the price for the bed and breakfast was $50 more per night than the next comparable option that was not black-owned. Why is that so important, I asked? I knew the likely answer, but my news nose was tingling. He went on to talk about the need for economic parity and promoting economic growth among black people, which he felt is just as if not even more important than building up a church community. He and his wife peppered our discussion with historical references: The black community was stronger in the 1920s and ’30s when it was segregated and we were forced to rely on black businesses to survive; in the 1960s and ’70s, black people had vision. They understood the bigger picture and why it was critical to “buy black” lest those valuable dollars continue to flee our community, leaving behind substandard goods and services at markedly higher prices. That’s all well and good, but there’s a reason why I don’t buy black. I’m willing to pay a higher price to support the community, but what I don’t support, I told my new train friend, is bad service, shoddy retail space and poor product selections. To defend my decisions, I described a vivid and repetitive scene featuring apathetic store clerks and me, walking in ready to plunk down my hard-earned dollars for whatever was suitable, and being stared at as if to say, “Why are you here?” My new acquaintance agreed, but then he began to talk about awareness. Those clerks, he said, were operating from a deficit. They did not know how to behave toward customers. “The clerk doesn’t know he or she should speak to me and look engaged when I come into the store?” I asked skeptically. That’s Business Operations 101. He nodded solemnly. Those clerks and the business owners who employ them likely have not been groomed to engage customers correctly. The breakdown, he said, between vision and community created a vast knowledge gap that is slowly but surely crippling black business. I considered this in light of what I know about the power of mentorship and sponsorship, the need to reach back and pull forward those who may not have had the same start, but still need to compete on the same field. Then I considered my new friend’s words in light of what I’ve learned about supplier diversity. This year, we made the decision to feature at least one story on the topic in every issue. If my new train friend’s conversation was any indication, we were more on target than I realized. Black communities are woefully short on black-owned businesses. This relates to the economic health and growth of our particular demographic. If consumers like me don’t buy black because of bad service, and bad service is related to lack of awareness, knowledge and skills, it’s more important than ever that corporate supplier diversity programs offer minority business owners the training they may need to compete effectively, expand their businesses and contribute to the economic health of the community. Check out our feature “In Short Supply” to learn more about what companies like Kroger and Walgreens are doing to ensure their supplier diversity programs work. And be sure to let me know what practices you’ve observed at work or believe should be a part of supplier diversity programs. It’s worth examining closely. Companies, communities and families may depend on it."

449,"Longtime University of Montana (UM) law professor John Smith is being forced to retire early due to budget cuts. This decision has left many in the UM community shocked and disappointed. Smith has been a fixture at UM for over three decades, teaching courses in legal ethics, constitutional law and civil procedure. He has also been a mentor to countless students and colleagues during his tenure at the university. Unfortunately, budget cuts have hit UM hard in recent years, leading to a reduction in funding for academic departments across the board. As a result, the university has been forced to find ways to reduce expenses, including cutting back on staffing and programs. For Smith, this meant that his position was no longer secure. Despite his long-standing contributions to the university and the legal community, he was informed that his contract would not be renewed for the upcoming academic year. The news was devastating for Smith, who had planned to continue teaching at UM for many years to come. In an interview with the Missoulian, he expressed his frustration with the decision. ""It's hard to believe that after all these years, I'm being forced out because of budget cuts,"" he said. ""I love teaching and mentoring students, and I feel like I still have so much to offer. It's a shame that the university can't find a way to keep me on."" Smith's departure has garnered significant attention within the UM community, with many expressing their disappointment at the university's decision. Several students, alumni and colleagues have written letters of support for Smith, praising his contributions to the university and to the legal profession. Robin Garner, a former student of Smith's who is now a practicing attorney in Montana, spoke highly of his impact on her career. ""Professor Smith taught me not only the law, but how to be a good advocate for my clients,"" she said. ""I'm incredibly grateful for his mentorship and guidance, and I know that many others feel the same way. It's a loss for the university and for the legal community as a whole."" The university has defended its decision, stating that it has no choice but to make tough cuts in order to balance its budget. UM President Seth Bodnar acknowledged the impact that such decisions can have on individuals, but emphasized the importance of making tough choices in order to ensure the long-term viability of the university. ""We recognize the significant contributions that Professor Smith has made to the university, and we value his time and dedication. Unfortunately, the current budget situation requires us to make difficult decisions,"" Bodnar said in a statement. Despite the university's stance, many continue to express their support for Smith and their disappointment with the situation. A petition urging the university to reconsider its decision has garnered thousands of signatures, and several local lawmakers have spoken out in support of Smith. The situation facing John Smith is unfortunately all too common in today's climate of budget cuts and fiscal constraints. As universities and other institutions struggle to balance their books, individuals like Smith are often caught in the crossfire, forced to retire early or find new positions elsewhere. For now, Smith is focused on his future, and is exploring new opportunities both within and outside of academia. But his legacy at UM will continue to be felt for years to come, as generations of students and colleagues continue to benefit from his mentorship and guidance. In the end, perhaps the greatest tragedy of the situation is the loss of experience and expertise that comes with the departure of individuals like John Smith. As universities and other institutions navigate an uncertain future, it is important that they find ways to preserve the talents and contributions of their most valuable assets, even in the face of adversity.","Back in the day, Jeff Renz helped pour cement for the M on Mount Sentinel. More recently, the law professor had students argue before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Renz, a longtime professor at the Alexander Blewett III School of Law at the University of Montana, came to Missoula in 1967. He studied forestry, got a degree in botany, and eventually received a law degree from UM. After 14 years in private practice, including several working on high-profile environmental cases for a firm based in Chicago, Renz returned to the law school at UM to teach. He's been on an annual contract since 1993. At the end of this semester, the teacher and director of the criminal defense clinic will retire. His departure is linked to the budget crunch at UM, and he appears to be the only contracted professor whose annual employment isn't being renewed because of money. In a letter to colleagues this summer, Renz announced his departure. ""The university's notice comes as a great disappointment to me for many reasons,"" Renz wrote. ""Many of you were my former students. Many of my former students became prosecutors and now sit as judges. ""I have always found joy in my students' growth from unsure to confident, from arrogant to humble (most of the time), and from ignorance to enlightenment. I will miss that."" *** The cut at the law school comes despite the fact it is on solid financial footing and steady enrollment, Renz said. ""The law school has never had budget issues. We've always sent money to Main Hall, and still have been doing that,"" he said. Enrollment at the law school also has not dropped, he said. In fact, he said, as other law schools across the country saw significant drops in the quality of applicants, such as lower GPA and LSAT scores, the rankings ticked up at UM. He said the law school in Missoula was recently one of just four that counted an increase in the number of applicants. But the overall enrollment numbers at UM have been in decline. ""So when that happens, the university calls back money from units,"" Renz said. ""And we'd been doing our fair share from year to year, and this past year, the provost called back a little bit more, and it was a little bit more than the school could bear without making cuts in the program."" In his letter to colleagues, he offered a stark description of the effects of the four-year dip: ""The university cut fat, then more fat, then meat, and now we are down to the bone. I am not the first full-time faculty member to be rif'd (reduction in force), but I am the first full-time member of the law faculty upon whom the ax has fallen."" *** Dean Paul Kirgis, who came on board this summer, agreed the law school was doing well financially. He said it continues to receive a steady stream of applications in contrast to the roughly 45 percent drop in law school applicants around the country. However, Kirgis said the overall financial picture at UM affects the law school. He said he wasn't part of the negotiation with Renz, but said the agreement came about because of the university-wide need for budget restraint. ""We are not facing an ongoing budget crisis in the law school, and we have no expectation that we will ... going forward,"" Kirgis said. He said the law school did not make other personnel cuts as a result of the budget crunch. *** Last semester, the school received a $10 million naming gift from the Blewett family of Great Falls. However, Renz said in his letter the money that could fund his position wouldn't be available for several years. ""It's sort of ironic, but it's understandable,"" Renz said. He also said that his position as a contracted professor made him vulnerable, although he himself had recommended his job be designed that way years ago. ""In terms of budget, I was always low-hanging fruit,"" Renz said. His end date will be Feb. 29. He said the school didn't give him adequate notice of one semester, so he and the former interim dean worked out a deal. The agreement gives Renz the upcoming semester to work on his own research, which he will do in Berkeley, California, where his wife will be for a Fulbright award. In exchange, he said, UM avoids paying some three or four months of salary. ""It was a good compromise,"" Renz said. He had planned to retire after this school year or next, regardless: ""So it was not an emotional hit for me."" *** Elaine Gagliardi, associate dean of students and professor at the law school, has worked with Renz for roughly 20 years. ""I have great respect for professor Renz, and I've seen him add a lot to our program,"" Gagliardi said. ""And he has always had very interesting clinic projects that I know have made a difference in a lot of people's lives."" As part of the criminal defense clinic, ""a live client program,"" Renz guided students as they represented their first defendants. The law school clinic offers the future lawyers real-world experience. ""This is your client. You will learn to swim,"" Renz said of his approach. ""I will be there helping you. Last year, I had students try four cases to a verdict, and they won three of them."" Every year, his students argue in the Ninth Circuit, ""and they do great. It's phenomenal for the experience. Just for having done it."" In fact, he said, the students are the highlight of the years he spent at the law school. It was satisfying to see them grow and excel, he said, and rewarding to see them become seasoned professionals. The parting was sometimes painful, though. ""About every three years, I get a class where I literally grieve when they graduate,"" Renz said. The professor has had other career successes beyond campus. A couple years ago, he was the recipient of a Fulbright, which took him to the country of Georgia. He also worked with former School of Journalism professor Clem Work on seeking posthumous pardons for people convicted of sedition. Gov. Brian Schweitzer signed the proclamation of pardons in Helena in 2006, with many families of those convicted in attendance. ""That was very satisfying. We persuaded the governor to pardon all these people from World War I,"" Renz said."
450,"In a tragic incident that has left the community reeling, a six-year-old girl was shot dead by her estranged father while she was staying at a ""safe house"" in the city. According to reports, the man, who had been estranged from his daughter's mother, gained entry to the house and shot the little girl at close range. Police were called to the scene and the man was arrested after a short pursuit. The incident has sent shockwaves throughout the community and left many residents asking how such a tragedy could have occurred. Police are currently investigating the incident and have released a statement urging anyone with information to come forward. The safe house where the incident occurred is a service provided for women and children who are fleeing domestic violence. It is designed to provide a safe haven for those in need and is staffed by trained professionals who are dedicated to providing a supportive environment for those in crisis. The tragic incident has highlighted the ongoing problem of domestic violence in our society. Experts believe that incidents like this are all too common, and that domestic violence is a pervasive problem that affects people from all walks of life. In response to the tragedy, local leaders have called for greater resources to be devoted to helping victims of domestic violence. They have emphasized the need for increased awareness and better education, as well as more funding for services like safe houses. Experts agree that the levels of domestic violence in our society are unacceptable and urgent action is needed to address the issue. They are calling for an end to the cycle of violence, which often begins in childhood and is perpetuated from generation to generation. In addition, there are growing concerns about the impact of domestic violence on children. Studies have shown that children who witness domestic violence can suffer from a range of emotional and behavioral problems, including anxiety, depression, and difficulty forming relationships. Experts are calling for increased support for children who are victimized by domestic violence, including counseling and therapy services. They argue that by providing children with the help they need, we can break the cycle of violence and help ensure a brighter future for all. As the investigation into this tragic incident continues, our thoughts are with the family and friends of the little girl who was killed. We can only hope that this tragedy will serve as a wake-up call for our society, and that we will all work together to put an end to domestic violence once and for all.","An estranged father tracked down his seven-year-old daughter and shot her in the head on her doorstep before turning the gun on himself, an inquest has heard. East Sussex coroner Alan Craze described the murder outside a ""safe house"" as a ""thoroughly despicable act of violence"" and said: ""It was not in any way spontaneous. It was pre-meditated over a long period of time."" Mary Shipstone, also known as Maryam Alromisse, was gunned down as she stood next to her mother, clutching a new violin, after she returned from school on September 11 last year, Hastings Coroner's Court was told. Her father, Yasser Alromisse, 46, was hidden in the rear of a silver Toyota on the drive by the house, in Northiam, near Rye, East Sussex, when he fired the shots. The attack took place at Spring Hill, where Mary had lived with her mother Lyndsey Shipstone, for the past year. She did not want be traced by Alromisse after the collapse of their marriage, which she said had been abusive. Alromisse had hired the vehicle that morning in Worthing, insisting to rental staff that he needed one with tinted windows, and had created a blind from bin bags to shield himself, the hearing was told. His body was later found in a pool of blood in the rear of the car, where he had shot himself in the head. Mr Craze concluded that Mary had been unlawfully killed, and ruled her father's death as suicide. The court heard how Alromisse had hired private detective Paul Parton, purporting to be a friend of his ex-wife, in May 2014 to try and establish the location of Mrs Shipstone, who he was still legally married to. Mr Parton was unable to locate Mrs Shipstone and later withdrew his services concerned Alromisse's motive was to take away the child. Promoted stories Coroner Mr Craze said it was not clear how Alromisse eventually found the address, but described the murder as a ""thoroughly despicable act of violence"". He added: ""It was not in any way spontaneous. It was pre-meditated over a long period of time."" Describing the day of the shooting, Mrs Shipstone said it had been ""ordinary"", but that Mary was ""very happy"" and ""excited"" about her birthday in seven days' time. She had been driven by a neighbour to collect Mary from school where she had had her first violin lesson. They parked up at their neighbour's and walked back towards their house. Mrs Shipstone told the court: ""I was putting my key in the door, and I spoke to Mary, saying she'd like what I had done to her room, and that's the last thing I said to her."" Mary was stood slightly behind her when she heard a loud noise. She said: ""There was a terrific sound behind me like someone had burst a balloon. ""I turned around and the first thing I saw was Mary on the ground - her legs were crumpled behind her."" She said she quickly realised that her ex-partner had shot Mary, saying she could ""see his face"" in the back seat of the Toyota parked on the nearby drive. She told the inquest: ""He did not show any emotion."" Mrs Shipstone carried Mary to a neighbour's home, where they tried to revive her while waiting for emergency services to arrive. She was taken to King's College Hospital, London, but later died of her injuries. Asked why Alromisse would have wanted to kill Mary, Mrs Shipstone replied: ""I don't think I will ever really know that. ""It was such an extreme thing to do. I can only guess that he wanted to kill himself and for some reason he thought that she should not live without him."" She added: ""He had the opportunity to shoot me as well, but he chose not to do it, and I was the one he supposedly hated the most. ""It's an act of revenge really. It's got to be. If he really loved her he would never have inflicted that on her."" Mrs Shipstone told the court: ""He's left me bereft of a daughter"". Mr Craze described it as a ""very sad and tragic case"". Speaking to Mrs Shipstone after reaching his conclusion, he said: ""You will, I hope, be relieved that the whole process of the coroner's inquest is over with. Share article ""You have got through it and I hope that the process will be deemed useful to you. ""But the main thing is you can put a full stop at the end of this chapter and get on with your life."""
451,"The Houston Astros defeated the Seattle Mariners 3-2 on Tuesday night in what was a tightly contested game at T-Mobile Park in Seattle. The Astros improved to 85-59 on the season, while the Mariners dropped to 77-67 on the year. Starting pitchers Lance McCullers Jr. for the Astros and Logan Gilbert for the Mariners both pitched well, with McCullers Jr. allowing only two runs and four hits over six innings and Gilbert allowing three runs and seven hits over 5 1/3 innings of work. Houston opened the scoring in the top of the second inning, when designated hitter Yordan Alvarez hit a two-run home run to deep right field, giving the Astros an early 2-0 lead. Seattle answered back in the bottom of the third inning, when second baseman Ty France hit a solo home run to left field, cutting Houston's lead to 2-1. The Mariners tied the game in the bottom of the fifth inning, when center fielder Jarred Kelenic hit an RBI single to right field, scoring shortstop J.P. Crawford. However, the Astros retook the lead in the top of the sixth inning, when outfielder Chas McCormick hit an RBI double to left field, scoring catcher Jason Castro. Both teams' bullpens were solid, as Houston relievers Brooks Raley, Kendall Graveman, and Ryan Pressly combined for three shutout innings, while Seattle relievers Drew Steckenrider, Paul Sewald, and Diego Castillo combined for 3 2/3 scoreless innings. Astros closer Pressly recorded his 28th save of the season, closing out the game in the bottom of the ninth inning, striking out two batters and allowing no hits or walks. With the win, Houston maintained their lead in the American League West division, while Seattle remained on the outside looking in in the playoff race. The two teams will continue their series on Wednesday night, with Mariners pitcher Tyler Anderson set to face Astros pitcher Jake Odorizzi in what promises to be another exciting matchup. As the regular season approaches its conclusion, both teams will be looking to finish strong and secure their spots in the postseason.

457,"Cobalt: Is Peter Moody on the brink of unravelling? Peter Moody, one of the most successful horse trainers in Australia, is facing a tough battle against allegations of administering covert doses of cobalt to his horses. The ongoing investigation has raised serious questions about Moody's integrity and put his career on the line. With the stakes this high, many wonder if Moody is on the brink of unravelling. Cobalt is a naturally occurring element that is found in small quantities in feed and supplements fed to racehorses. It is not a prohibited substance, and horses are permitted to have trace amounts of cobalt in their system. However, excessive amounts of cobalt are believed to enhance athletic performance and can be dangerous to the health of the animal. Moody, who has trained dozens of Group One winners, including the legendary mare Black Caviar, has been accused of administering cobalt in doses above the legal limit. The charges were brought against him by Racing Victoria, which conducted a comprehensive investigation into his stable. Moody has vehemently denied the charges, insisting that he has always played by the rules and never administered any prohibited substances to his horses. He has also asserted that the charges have taken a toll on his mental health and caused significant stress to his family and loved ones. While Moody waits for the outcome of the case, the question of whether he is on the brink of unravelling remains. The allegations are serious and could have a devastating impact on his career, reputation, and legacy. If found guilty, Moody could face a lengthy suspension or even a lifetime ban from the sport. He could also be fined a substantial amount of money and require to pay Racing Victoria's costs, which would be a significant blow to his finances. Moreover, the accusations would tarnish his legacy and undermine his reputation as a top-class trainer. Moody's supporters argue that the charges are baseless and that he is the victim of a witch hunt. They point to the fact that Moody is a respected figure in the racing industry and has never been involved in any previous doping scandals. They also argue that the case has been dragged on for too long, causing undue stress and anxiety to Moody and his family. On the other hand, Moody's critics suggest that the evidence against him is damning and that he has no defence. They argue that the cobalt levels found in his horses were well above the permissible limit and that there is no explanation other than deliberate doping. It is also worth noting that cobalt has become a significant issue in Australian racing in recent years. Several trainers have been sanctioned for the illegal use of cobalt, including Mark Kavanagh and Danny O'Brien. As a result, Racing Victoria has implemented new regulations to combat the issue, which has put more pressure on trainers to be compliant with the rules. In conclusion, the case against Peter Moody is complex and controversial. The allegations of doping have put his career, reputation, and legacy in jeopardy, and the stakes could not be higher. While Moody insists that he is innocent and that the charges are unfounded, the evidence against him is compelling. Only time will tell whether he is on the brink of unravelling or whether he will emerge victorious from this challenging situation.","For those outside the inner sanctum of the racing industry who are perplexed at the mileage the Peter Moody saga has gained this week or, for that matter, the past few months, the answer is simple: an unrelenting media cheer squad. Even those removed from the sport can see by his poor-taste rants that Moody is slowly unravelling. Whichever way he manoeuvres the question remains: how did Lidari arrive at Flemington with double the threshold levels of cobalt in its system? But the media cheer squad continue to skirt around the clear realities of the case. For the third time this week, Moody threatened to resign from racing. He's threatened to move to Darwin, talked about a pub in Queensland and, for all we know, by Saturday night he may be looking at a convenience store in Papua New Guinea. He has 110 of some of the most expensive racehorses in Australia housed at his Caulfield base. His winning strike-rate has not altered, nor has his client base deserted him since Lidari's swab earlier this year. But his trusting media contingency was shown at their very best this week, as they gave Moody more oxygen to explain why the world is against him. You see, it's a one-way deal. Moody is a man not to fall out with, so the premiership-winning trainer has polarised the media. The height of the pro-Moody campaign was achieved by a News Limited reporter — who had been barred off and on from the Moody stable over the past decade — who even checked out how the trainer was faring the night of his now-infamous race-day treatment at Pakenham. The reporter went on to say Moody had arrived home to find the family gone out for the night and he had to manage on scraps and a few beers and their faithful dog for company. However, worse was to come. On Memsie Stakes day at Caulfield, at the start of the meeting, former AFL clerk and racing tipster Shane Anderson mournfully announced after Moody had won the opening race that the trainer would not speak to the media for the remainder of the day as he was under pressure over the cobalt matter. This message went out to the newly-launched Channel 78 viewers plus racing.com . Anderson, the day before Memsie Stakes day, had given Moody 20 minutes of air time to tell his sad-and-sorry story. The only challenging question from Anderson was: ""Do you mind if we go for a commercial break?"" During this interview Moody challenged the industry to ""pull the splinters out of your arse and join me or not"". While Anderson conveyed the news the cobalt issue had prevented Moody speaking to the media, 20 metres from where Anderson was working, stewards were grilling Moody over the outrageous statements made on Anderson's show and told the trainer of Black Caviar that such outbursts would not be tolerated. They went on to remind Moody of his obligations to the licence that he holds. This was not broadcast on Channel 78 nor reported on racing.com . It took Fairfax Media's Andrew Garvey to question whether Moody's media ban was connected with stewards. He was told Moody was spoken to about his remarks made on Anderson's show. When Fairfax Media tried to contact Channel 78 chief executive Scott Perrin to see if any action had been taken against Anderson, the CEO did not answer our calls. Anderson last Wednesday gave Moody another 20 minutes of air time to bag officials and continue to cry foul. The level of questioning by Anderson was shameful. ""We go back a long way, Pete"" is not good enough for balanced news. It's interesting to note that two weeks last Wednesday Ballarat trainer Kylie Vella was charged under the same race-day-treatment rule for using the same poultice as Moody's filly. Vella was not given a paragraph in racing publications nor air play on Anderson's show. And it's strange how integrity officers Australia-wide were sacked over the live-baiting scandal that rocked greyhound racing — with governments and media claiming those in charge had fallen asleep at the wheel — but once three leading trainers are netted, the rule book must be changed. A mindless collection of quotes from Moody's friends in the Caulfield trainers' hut that came out in support of him is nowhere near reflective of the feeling of trainers. Fairfax Media has received countless emails from around the state applauding the integrity department of Racing Victoria, as they are sick of being beaten by cheats. And it would be timely to allow Moody, Mark Kavanagh, Danny O'Brien, and Lee and Shannon Hope to have their cases heard without cheer squads and self-styled experts who have a year-nine biology background. It's worth noting that Lee and Shannon Hope have shown class and dignity after they were charged last year. The didn't ask for any media free kicks or inside runs. They are sitting and waiting, aware that talking and yelling won't help their cause. It's timely advice for a few others waiting for their day in court to arrive.

Ashley Ludwig photo. There is a new name in gourmet hot dogs in Temecula, and a new attitude behind your neighborhood hangout. South Temecula has many things, but corner hangouts for after a sports game, a beer softball league, or a place for teams to host their latest fundraiser are in short supply. Enter Suzette Swanger, mother and Temecula resident, who saw a restaurant in crisis and stepped in to take it to the next level. “We purchased Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs over five months ago,” Swanger said, “and it’s been a heck of a ride since.” Lagunitas IPA on tap at Temecula’s Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs – the hot dog joint around the corner. Ashley Ludwig photo. This hot dog shop has changed hands a few times, but Swanger has that special something to make sure that all who enter to try Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs will return again, with friends and family in tow. Inside, it’s like being invited to a family barbecue – complete with checked table cloths, mountains of napkins for the juicy dogs and sandwiches and ample supplies of squeezable mustard and ketchup. A jukebox on the wall plays fun, classic or recent hip tunes, depending on the crowd. Regulars hang out at the bar. Families at the tables, ordering hand dipped sweet corn dogs or baskets of homemade potato chips. Remember, when you come in to Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs, bring the family and prepare to mind your manners during the big game. “We initiated a ‘Bad Word Box’ for anyone caught swearing at the bar when kids are present,” Swanger said, thumbing through the stack of bills. “It’s a relatively new idea and fun for those in the know. At the end of the month we plan on donating the funds raised to a local charity.” Behind the bar, tap handles range from backyard barbecue cheap beer – Pabst Blue Ribbon – that will more than likely always remain on tap, according to Swanger, to featured craft brew, such as the Petaluma based brewer Lagunitas IPA. Regionally famous for their India Pale Ale, this well balanced beer is now featured at Devil Dogs. With caramel malt barley to mellow the hop flavors, Lagunitas is one for beer lovers to try. “I love having friends over, cooking and entertaining. Devil Dogs has become a natural extension of that,” she said. Suzette Swanger, right, and staff mug for the camera while the games play on one of many TVs in this local sports bar and restaurant. Ashley Ludwig photo. Lunch time at this hot dog shop finds locals at the many tables or hanging out at the comfortable bar seating. TVs have multiple games on, showcasing college football on a September morning. The menu is chock full of gourmet hot dogs, such as the bacon wrapped Sonoran Dog, or the Portuguese Hawaiian Sausage, with spicy Mad Mike’s sausage combined with sweet pineapple flavors. Of course, fans can build their own hot dog or sausage creations with the ever growing list of toppings. “Last week, we added mushrooms to our list,” Swanger said. “It’s always fun to see just how high people can top their hot dogs or sausages.” Along with the multiple specialty dogs and sandwiches, Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs also makes their own hand-cut French fries, onion rings, and homemade potato chips. “We consider ourselves farm to table here, even though our farm is in Arizona,” she said. “Everything is homemade here in the shop.” Hand Dipped Corn Dogs are sweet and crunchy, “like we get at the fair!” as one child described the tasty offering. Shown over a bed of hand cut fries and homemade potato chips, Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs can turn anything on their gourmet menu into a corn dog. Ashley Ludwig photo. Side dishes for the gourmet offerings are just as one would expect from a corner hot dog shop, with the added benefit of Swanger’s special touch. The coleslaw is her family recipe, not creamy but sliced thin, crisp cabbage and poppy seeds made in small batches and tossed in an apple cider vinaigrette. This slaw complements the perfectly prepared hotdogs and sausages. Her potato salad, in a nod to deviled eggs, has a kick and just the right balance of sweet, salt, and heat with the addition of paprika and pimento. Bringing Mad Mike’s Sausages into the mix was a natural choice for Swanger, making gourmet hot dogs the order of the day. From mild to wild, the big name in local sausage can be fully tasted here. “Mad Mike’s adds that amazing flavor for every dog and sausage, except those listed as Vienna Beef hot dogs,” she said. “His chicken sausage is simply the best I’ve ever tasted.” The gourmet Sonoran Dog, a bacon wrapped 8-inch hot dog, topped with refried beans, flavorful homemade guacamole, pico de gallo and drizzled with sour cream all on a sweet hot dog bun will satisfy lovers of the traditional Mexican hot dog. Swanger’s guacamole will have you begging for the recipe though it’s a trade secret. The hand-cut chips are an ideal side for this dish, salted, light and crisp, not greasy in any way. A whimsical example of “farm to table,” Suzette Swanger shows how the potatoes from their grower transform into the thinly sliced potato chips they make and serve daily at Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs. Ashley Ludwig photo. “We’re becoming famous for our chips,” she said. Fans and friends of Devil Dogs can come for any game, any time, and the television will never be turned off before the game is done. “We won’t throw people out just because it’s after our closing time, if the game goes long,” she said. “The name, ‘Devil Dogs’ is a United States Marine Corps reference, though our family isn’t in the military,” she said. “We kept that name because we are proud to be Americans, and of our soldiers in this military town. That’s why we decided to focus on Patriot Day for a raffle and fundraiser.” The donations for this fundraiser, to raise funds toward the U.S. Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command Foundation are growing daily. “We are big fans of this local charitable foundation that raises funds for local Marine families,” she said. “That, and with Patriot Day coming, we knew we needed to do something to help.” A United States Marine Corps commemorative poker chip was a gift to Suzette Swanger, from one of her many military guests. Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs is a friend to the military and those who have served. Ashley Ludwig photo. The Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs fundraiser will run from Friday, Sept. 11 through Tuesday, Sept. 15 with all proceeds benefitting the MARSOC Foundation. Raffle items will include Mad Mike’s American Gourmet Products, a golf package, and a guitar donated by Pabst Blue Ribbon. “When we learned about the MARSOC Foundation, we knew we needed to do something to draw attention to this organization,” she said.

Commonly referred to as an enlarged heart, restrictive cardiomyopathy often leads to diastolic dysfunction – the inability to adequately move blood through the circulatory system. Without surgery and treatment, restrictive cardiomyopathy can lead to heart failure.

Though doctors warned the Cantrells that they would likely outlive their daughter, Grace was saved by a donor heart that she received in a transplant on her fourth birthday.

461,"In today's world of social media, it has become essential for local governments to have an official online presence to connect with the residents they serve. However, Lower Makefield Township Supervisors have taken a different approach to this by deciding not to set up an official Facebook page for their township. Instead, they have chosen to look into using Twitter as their primary social media platform. At the most recent township meeting, the board of supervisors discussed the pros and cons of setting up a Facebook page for the township. While some members of the board supported the idea, others were not convinced that it was the right move for the township. The concerns raised included the potential for negative comments and reviews, the risk of inappropriate content being posted, and the need for constant moderation to ensure appropriate use. In contrast, Twitter was seen as a more appropriate platform for a local government with a smaller following. It allows for quick, concise communication with residents and followers, and the ability to address any concerns or questions in a timely manner. Additionally, the board felt that Twitter could help them reach a wider audience, including younger residents who may not use Facebook as often as other social media platforms. While some may argue that Twitter does not have as large a user base as Facebook, the township felt that it was important to prioritize quality over quantity. By focusing on a platform that best suits their needs and resources, they hope to provide the best customer service and communication with their residents. Overall, the decision to forego an official Facebook page and instead focus on Twitter reflects the township's commitment to meeting the needs of their community while being responsible stewards of their resources. As technology continues to evolve and new platforms emerge, the township will continue to assess their social media strategy to ensure they are making the most of their resources and effectively communicating with their residents.","By D.E. Schlatter Digital First Media LOWER MAKEFIELD >> While neighboring municipalities such as Yardley Borough and Falls Township have jumped into the 21st Century and set up official Facebook pages, Lower Makefield’s board of supervisors are cautious about taking the plunge, at least on Facebook. At the July 15 supervisors’ meeting, the Electronic Media Advisory Board (EMAB) presented its recommendations that Lower Makefield should supplement its township website with Facebook and Twitter. But several of the supervisors balked at the suggestion, stating that if the township set up an official Facebook page, some of the postings in the comment section could be hostile and inflammatory. “I like the idea of a page, but then you bring in Captain Courageous on a keyboard and it can get out of hand,” declared Supervisor Dan McLaughlin. “I’m worried about a rogue person getting us on the national news,” he added. “Saying something about the police or safety at the pool.” But EMAB Chairman Zachary Rubin said that for Lower Makefield to use Facebook and Twitter is the best way to keep in touch with residents, especially if there is an emergency and information must be quickly dispatched. “It’s the best way of people communicating with the township,” Rubin said, noting that social media helps direct individuals to the township Web page where more updated information can be posted. Fellow EMAB member Jill Laurinaitis said that according to a recent Pew Foundation study, 71 percent of adults in the U.S. are on Facebook and 18 percent use Twitter, numbers which are much higher in the younger population. In an attempt to quell the supervisors’ fear of inappropriate comments, Laurinaitis explained, “People’s behavior is better on these pages.” Although she acknowledged that “you have to have somebody monitoring it.” According to Laurinaitis, other local governments with Facebook identities often have a staffer dedicated to reading the comments, and removing them if they do not fit into the page’s guidelines. Continued... “You have an editor,” said EMAB member Frederick Young. But Supervisor Chairman Kristin Tyler worried that if a Facebook page is set up the township would have to have an employee monitor all the comments, which could be both time-consuming and costly. Not all board members scoffed at the establishing a Facebook identity. Supervisor Ron Smith, who is the board’s liaison with the EMAB, said that Lower Makefield having a Facebook identity is “a great idea. “You can’t ignore the 21st Century,” Smith attested. “If it’s working elsewhere than it’s something we should aspire to.” Smith pointed out that nine years ago several Lower Makefield officials opposed televising the supervisors’ meeting, arguing that it would attract unruly individuals who would co-opt the meetings with hostile public comments. But that has not occurred, and he said the same fears appear to be aimed at using Facebook. Meanwhile, township solicitor Jeff Garton, who also represents Doylestown Township which has a Facebook page, said that so far the comment section there has been “pretty tame.” While the majority of supervisors for now were seemingly unreceptive to diving into the Facebook pool, setting up an official Twitter account received a better reception. Currently, the Lower Makefield Police Department is using Twitter to send messages and alerts to residents, and Chief Ken Coluzzi says it’s working very well. Continued... But Twitter is different than Facebook, according to the chief, “We don’t take comments.” Township manager Terry Fedorchak said that he would start working on whether the township should set up an official Twitter account. “The Twitter approach is more appealing to me than going on Facebook,” he maintained. The Electronic Media Advisory Board also recommended that the township update it somewhat antiquated website and make mobile apps available for smartphones so the Web page can be better accessed. This way, according to EMAB Chairman Rubin, Lower Makefield can interact more efficiently with its residents, as well as contact them during emergencies. Rubin and the police chief also noted that Bucks County has a new emergency notification system in place called BucksAlertPA, which replaces ReadyNotifyPA. Coluzzi advised residents who signed up for the old system to reapply to BucksAlertPA, so that they can receive updates and alerts through their smartphones, e-mails, and house phones.

Triathlon returns for the seventh annual Hever Castle Triathlon weekend over the 26th and 27th September, ready to write another historic chapter at the former home of King Henry VIII. Fittingly for its seventh edition, the number seven features prominently throughout the event – starting with a record breaking number of entries currently standing at 7,000. The youngest competitor lining up in the world's biggest kids race is seven, whilst the oldest competitor is 77. The stunning venue, located in the heart of Kent, welcomes competitors from across the UK and internationally in a series of distances and challenges (including the biggest children's triathlon in the world). Its position at the end of the busy triathlon calendar and the final stop on the Castle Triathlon Series means that there is a party-like festival atmosphere as triathletes sign off their season with PB's, new distances achieved or sporting success shared with their friends of families. The atmosphere is boosted by 500 camping through the weekend and lots of entertainment including bands, climbing walls, archery, trade stands, fun fair and pleasure rides. The event attracts some of the best triathletes in Britain who are set to race hard and fast for their share of the trophies and prize money. Up for grabs this year is a prize fund of £8,000 that stands at £2,000 for the Standard Distance race, whilst those triumphing in the toughest challenge of the day, the half-iron Gauntlet race, will also take home their share of £2,000. Further prizes are given for Series winners. Favourites for The Gauntlet 2015 titles The Gauntlet at Hever Castle is the biggest test in the Castle Triathlon Series. The half-iron distance triathlon takes competitors into the rolling hills of the Kent Weald and through an ‘area of outstanding beauty'. Triathletes who took on the 1.9km swim, 90km bike and 21km run last year unequivocally reviewed it as one of the ‘must-do' events in the UK and attracted to the challenge, the field has grown once again this year from 200 in 2013 to now over 850 – making it one of the most popular in the country. Spearheading the men's field will be the intriguing re-match between Darren Jenkins (Bastion 2015 champion) and Karl Alexander (Hever Castle Gauntlet 2013 champion). These two had an awesome battle at Hever Castle earlier this year over the iron-distance Bastion Triathlon in July, with Jenkins emerging on top with his fearsome run proving the decisive factor. Now set to battle it out again over the middle distance, will Jenkins once again have the upper hand, or will the shorter distance suit Alexander who will have less run course to cover before the finish line comes? These questions and more will all be answered over the race. Jenkins and Alexander won't have it all their own way as there is talent throughout the field, not least in the form of XTERRA professional Matt Dewis, Irish Middle Distance champion Kevin Thornton and talented racer Will Cowan – who can all challenge for the podium and have the class to win. British and Scottish Middle Distance Champion Nikki Bartlett is in the field and is the clear favourite for the women's title at Hever Castle Gauntlet Triathlon. Also in the field is Pete Dyson, Andy Dyson, Max Hazell, Ben Matthews, Colin Norris, Ben Pritchard and Neil Tandy. The women's race will feature Bex Milnes and Kim Morrison. Olympic distance speedsters Whilst the Gauntlet represents a test of speed over distance at Hever Castle Triathlon, the speed kings and queens will take on the Olympic distance triathlon, which comprises of the shorter (but no less testing), distances of 1.5km swim, 40km bike and 10km run. Competing for these titles will be elite athletes including Liam Lloyd, Phil Edgley, James Fearn, Calum Johnson, William Kirk and Scott Thompson. The women's race looks particularly exciting, with Catherine Jameson headlining the field. Jameson is a fearsome competitor on the Castle Triathlon Series circuit and has picked up wins at Chateau du Chantilly, Castle Howard and Cholmondeley already this year. Jameson is such a fan of the Hever Castle Triathlon that she has published her top ten reasons to do the race HERE . Hever Castle would complete the set. However, a challenge will come from another former Hever Castle Champion, Vicky Johnston and also from the reigning European Aquathlon Champion Hannah Kitchen. Hever Castle – the ‘must-do British race' In just six years the Hever Castle Triathlon has swiftly established itself as an essential destination for British and international triathletes, garnering plaudits and mainstream media attention for its picture postcard venue, elite action, age-group choice and festival atmosphere. There are no fewer than 14 race choices on offer making it one of the biggest events in the UK. To cement the race's title as the world's largest children's triathlon, over 1,600 junior athletes are expected to take part. The races will begin with an amended and unique open-water swim in the spectacular 38 acre Hever Castle Lake and River Eden. This creates an incredible spectacle that is rewarding for both the athletes and the spectators who can see one of the most exciting parts of the race up-close. Competitors in The Gauntlet will take on a single 1.9km lap whilst those racing in the Olympic distance will take on (for the first time), a single 1.5km lap. Those taking part will then transition onto the undulating cycle that takes athletes around a 20km circuit through the High Weald of Kent, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, with one lap for the Sprint and two laps for the Olympic-distance racers. Those on The Gauntlet will be on a specially designed two-lap course. The largely off-road run circumnavigates the estate and award-winning castle grounds before making the dash to the tree-lined finishing chute beside the lake. Fun for spectators too This year there is even more planned for friends, family and all the supporters at the Hever Castle Triathlon Triathlon, with a variety of live music, family games and of course a brilliant atmosphere for all. Relax in the grounds of one of the most famous castles in England and enjoy the action unfold!

463,"Drones have become a ubiquitous sight at major sporting events, as fans and photographers alike seek the perfect aerial shot of the action. But as drones get cheaper and easier to operate, security officials are struggling to keep up with the growing threats they pose. At stadiums across the country, security teams are on high alert for drones that might be used to spy on players, drop explosives, or even disrupt games. But while drones may be easy to spot, they're much harder to stop. ""For every one drone we detect, there are probably 10 more that we don't,"" says John Cieslak of Security Solutions International, a company that provides security training to sports venues. ""And once a drone is in the air, it can be very difficult to bring down."" Some stadiums have tried using jamming devices to disrupt the signals that drones use to communicate with their operators. But this approach has its own drawbacks, as it can also interfere with other communication systems, such as cell phones and emergency radios. Other stadiums have turned to counter-drone technology, such as systems that can disable drones by shooting them down with lasers or other weapons. But these systems are expensive, and can pose their own safety risks. Despite the challenges, security experts say that the threat of drones at stadiums is only going to grow in the coming years. With advances in drone technology, drones are likely to become more autonomous and harder to detect. ""We're going to see drones that can carry more weight, fly longer distances, and even make decisions on their own,"" says Cieslak. ""We need to be prepared for that."" One solution that some stadiums are exploring is the use of trained birds of prey to take down drones. Birds such as falcons and eagles have been trained to attack and capture drones, using their remarkable eyesight and agility to pursue their targets. While bird-based counter-drone measures are still relatively new, experts say they could be an effective and eco-friendly way to combat the growing threat of drones. ""At some stadiums, we've been training falcons and other raptors to take down drones,"" says Cieslak. ""It's a low-tech solution that can be very effective."" Of course, even trained birds of prey have their limitations. They can only take down drones that are within their line of sight, and they can't fly at night or in bad weather. Ultimately, security officials say that the best defense against drones is a combination of advanced technology, vigilant staff, and strong communication. ""We need to have eyes on the sky at all times,"" says Cieslak. ""We need people who know what to look for, and we need to be prepared to act quickly if we see something suspicious."" As drone technology continues to advance, it's become clear that the threat of drones at stadiums is not going away anytime soon. But by working together and staying ahead of the curve, security officials can help keep fans and players safe from harm.","Whether they're crashing into the bleachers or simply hovering above stadiums to get a cool picture of the action down below, drones have become semi-regular guests at the ballparks these days. That has put the federal government, local police forces and security think tanks on alert, trying to catch up to the technology and figure out how to prevent the hard-to-stop devices from doing major damage. ""It's scary for all of us,"" said Lou Marciani, the director of the National Center for Spectator Sports Safety and Security. ""A crash, even without a payload, has the potential to injure several people. And if they carry a payload, it could be anything from a weapon to anthrax to something worse than that."" Drone crashes, two days apart, at the U.S. Open in New York and before a Kentucky football game, made news earlier this month. But over the past two years, more than 50 unmanned aircrafts have flown over Major League Baseball and NFL stadiums, coming and going quietly — usually controlled by a hobbyist who either lost control of the device or wanted a picture of their favorite team in action. No harm done. But the prospect of the drones doing something worse has security experts looking for answers, and quickly. Last October, the Federal Aviation Administration issued notice that it's illegal to fly drones near Major League Baseball, NFL and NCAA Division I college football games and major auto races. Other sporting events can put their own bans in place. But the penalties for violating a ban — and who hands out those sentences — is still murky. In the Kentucky case, campus police brought wanton endangerment charges against the owner of the wayward drone; at the U.S. Open, New York police brought similar charges against a high school science teacher who lost control of his drone. The FAA issued a ""law enforcement guidance"" paper to help local jurisdictions figure out this new problem. It lists its own enforcement tools — including warning notices, letters of correction and civil penalties — but suggests state and local police do most of the work to detect the drones and enforce the penalties. In its notice about temporary flight restrictions at sporting events, the FAA lists reckless endangerment, operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence, trespassing and assault as possible criminal charges for unsanctioned drone use. Much of this, experts say, is the result of seat-of-the-pants law- and rule-making to combat a new and very fluid problem. And none of it addresses the most important issue: How to prevent a drone from coming into a stadium in the first place. ""So much of this is unknown and so much of it raises so many questions,"" said Derek Catsam of University of Texas of the Permian Basin, who studies stadium security issue. ""It's a case of where the technology is so far ahead of our ability to come to grips with it."" There are around 2,500 Major League Baseball games a year, so 31 drone sightings last year and nine so far this season does not constitute a major crisis, said John Skinner, the director of security for MLB. Still, baseball took part in a government project called ""Operation Foul Ball"" last year at the All-Star Game in Minneapolis to try to detect drones. Skinner said Minneapolis police worked with the Department of Homeland Security on a system that could identify the radio frequencies of drones before they took off. ""In essence, it worked,"" he said. But it didn't necessarily protect against the drones taking off; one found its way to the stadium during the home run derby. Also, there are private companies that can provide the same service using similar technology, and some of the teams have been approached about working with those companies. Among the dozens of uses for drones at sports facilities is attaching cameras to get before-impossible angles for the TV broadcasts. In January, ESPN cleared numerous regulatory hurdles so it could have drones with cameras follow skiers and snowboarders down the hill for the Winter X Games. ESPN got approval only by ensuring it would not fly the drones over spectators or in the air space of planes flying in and out of a nearby airport. Chris Calcinari, who spearheaded the approvals process for ESPN, called it a big opportunity because ""I don't think there are many events that would actually allow us to fly a drone."" Another application: For security. It's possible that drones themselves could be used to keep renegade drones away from fans. And a drone can hover over a stadium to look for weapons, fights and other disruptions. The idea of ""good"" drones and ""bad"" drones flying over the same stadium may seem like stuff of the future. But it's an idea that's not too farfetched. ""We're in that infant stage of, what does this all mean and where is it going?"" Marciani said. ""It's too early to know. You're crawling. You're not even standing up yet."""
464,"Boehner's conservative critics are following false prophets that make empty promises, according to recent reports. These so-called ""purists"" are ramping up their criticism of the former speaker, arguing that he is not conservative enough. However, many experts have pointed out that these critics are more focused on political posturing than addressing real issues. Boehner's record as a conservative leader is clear, with accomplishments such as passing major tax cuts and fighting against government overreach.

465,"Residents of Ramsbottom recently came together to celebrate a special occasion: the 95th birthday of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. In honor of this important milestone, the local church rang its bells throughout the day, filling the town with the sound of joy and celebration. St. Paul's Church in Ramsbottom has a long history of honoring the Queen and her family, and this year was no exception. The ringing of the bells served as a reminder of the Queen's remarkable life and legacy, as well as the many ways in which she has served and inspired the people of the United Kingdom. Many residents of Ramsbottom were thrilled to be a part of this unique celebration. For some, the sound of the chimes was a reminder of happy memories from years past, while others saw it as a symbol of hope for the future. ""I grew up hearing those bells every year, and it always brings back fond memories,"" said local resident Elsie Thompson. ""It's wonderful to see the community come together to honor our Queen and everything she's done for us."" The bells of St. Paul's Church were rung in a variety of patterns throughout the day, including a special ""plain bob"" peal in honor of the Queen's birthday. The sound echoed throughout the town, reminding everyone of the important place that the Queen holds in the hearts and minds of the people of Ramsbottom. Overall, the ringing of the bells was a beautiful and poignant tribute to the Queen, and a testament to the strong sense of community that exists in this charming town.","A GROUP of bell ringers gave a right royal welcome to church visitors last week. St Paul's Church in Maple Grove, Ramsbottom , hosted a jigsaw fair last week and welcomed several hundred visitors, including the Mayor of Bury, Cllr Stella Smith. As she arrived to open the fair on September 9, the church's bell ringers performed to mark the Queen's special day as she became the longest serving monarch in Britain. The ringers' group was set up in 2008 and there are currently 14 members, with three others learning the art form of ringing traditional church bells. According to St Paul's bell ringer Colin Willsea, it takes on average 16 hours to learn the basics of the discipline, but many more years to master. ""I know a chap who has been doing it for 40 years and he considers himself to be intermediate level,"" said Mr Willsea, aged 45, of Ramsbottom. He added: ""It is a lot of fun, but it can become a little bit of an obsession as there is always something new to learn. Share article ""I really enjoyed performing for so many people to mark the Queen's special day. It's the first time I have ever performed at a special event and I started the hobby 18 months ago.

This was the largest funding round to date for Civitas, which was founded in 2011 by former Kaplan education executive Charles Thornburgh and an educator and administrator, Mark David Milliron. Universities and colleges that use Civitas give the company access to information from its student population such as grades, course loads, and financial aid packages. The company then analyzes the data and creates a system of predictive analytics to help universities figure out who might be at risk of dropping out. It also builds applications on top of its data platform that can help students pick majors, and analyzes for university administrators the effectiveness of courses. Civitas generates revenue by selling software subscriptions. About 850 campuses use its services, including the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Arizona, according to its website. Adarsh Sarma, managing director at Warburg Pincus, in a statement said Civitas was ""a pioneer in the field of using applied data analytics to improve student outcomes."" As state- and federal-funded universities face performance-based funding requirements in which graduation rates are increasingly tied to their budgets, companies like Civitas can be brought in to seek improved results. ""With this investment, we are going to be able to improve and accelerate both learning and student outcomes for our partner institutions,"" said Thornburgh, Civitas' chief executive. The company will use the money for research and development as well as potential mergers and acquisitions. Besides Warburg Pincus, the fundraising round includes previous investors including Emergence Capital Partners, Austin Ventures, Rethink Education, SJF Ventures and Gera Venture Capital. Warburg has a history of making money from investments in education technology. For example, it sold iParadigms LLC which makes ""Turnitin"" plagiarism software, for $752 million, including debt, to Insight Venture Partners last year. (Reporting by Liana B.

467,"As the old adage goes, ""there's more to life than meets the eye."" This saying can also be applied to the world of postgraduate education. While most students tend to focus on CAT (Common Admission Test) or MAT (Management Aptitude Test) as their gateway to an MBA, there are other options available that can broaden their horizons and provide them with unique perspectives. One such option is the NMAT (NMIMS Management Aptitude Test) conducted by the prestigious NMIMS University in Mumbai. This test provides candidates with the opportunity to pursue a full-time MBA program in various specializations such as Finance, Information Systems, and Marketing. The university has a world-class faculty and a strong alumni network which can provide students with a valuable learning experience and open up new career opportunities. Another option is the XAT (Xavier Aptitude Test) conducted by Xavier University in Bhubaneswar. This test is not only a gateway to its MBA program, but also to numerous other programs such as PGDM (Post Graduate Diploma in Management) and PGDM-HRM (Post Graduate Diploma in Management- Human Resource Management). The university has a strong focus on social responsibility and ethical business practices, which can be beneficial for students who are seeking to make a positive impact in their careers. The SNAP (Symbiosis National Aptitude Test) conducted by the Symbiosis International University in Pune is yet another option. This test provides access to a wide range of MBA specializations such as Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Communication Management, and Operations Management. The university has a diverse student community and provides students with the opportunity to collaborate with peers from different backgrounds and cultures. Apart from these, there are also international options such as the GRE (Graduate Record Examination) and the GMAT (Graduate Management Admission Test) which are widely accepted by top universities across the globe. These tests not only provide access to MBA programs but also to other postgraduate programs such as Master of Science and Master of Arts. It is important to note that while CAT and MAT are the most popular choices, they are not the only ones. Each of these tests has its own unique focus and providing candidates with different perspectives and learning experiences. It is important for students to explore their options and choose the best one for their career aspirations and personal goals. In conclusion, life beyond CAT and MAT does exist, and it is full of opportunities waiting to be explored. Whether it is NMAT, XAT, SNAP, GRE, or GMAT, each of these tests provides students with a unique opportunity to pursue their dreams and achieve their goals. It is up to the students to grasp these opportunities with open arms, step out of their comfort zones, and explore the unexplored.","By admin - Tue Sep 22, 8:37 pm Edited by admin Rohan Ganeriwala Each year the number of students sitting for CAT and MAT increases. As chances of gaining admission to top institutes declines, students end up devoting years of study and preparation without realistic expectation of success. However, there are other options for students out there! If you want to be judged holistically, if you are a smart individual but bad test-taker, or if you are simply hankering for global exposure, applying abroad is your best route forward. Applying to top institutes overseas requires a combination of factors. The first are the exams—you may take either GRE/ GMAT as most colleges accept these tests. These tests are less comprehensive in material covered than the CAT and are only one part of your whole application. Students also need to prepare their professional CVs, speak to professors for recommendation letters, write individual essays for each college, and ready themselves for interviews. In the strongest applications, each of these components is well-rounded. Students may help themselves greatly by gaining experience in their respective field through internships and work experiences. Colleges often try to “look beyond the numbers,” for applicants—looking beyond just marks. Work experience, an understanding of one’s own caliber, and plentiful involvement with social projects and campus service all go toward strengthening the applicant’s profile It is important to receive right counseling in navigating these requirements. A good counselor can help shortlist colleges according to “fit,” i.e. through their suitability for individuals instead of blindly following rankings. Counseling can introduce you to programs like HBS 2+2 or YLP or even similar courses likes MIM, LBS etc. By working with an experienced mentor, you can maximize chances of admission by picking the right courses and the right schools. They can also help write essays showcasing yourself most positively, run through mock interviews with you, and keep your focus on the final goal—admission at a top university! A mentor can also help you apply to correct scholarships and funding sources, as expenses are a major concern for all applicants. Ensure your counselor is suggesting the best colleges for you, not their own pocket. There are many non-Indian options for higher education. If one does badly in CAT/GMAT/GRE, they can apply to Singapore/UK. Many colleges do not even require GMAT scores and only require undergraduate marks. However, you must be careful as both countries have several sub-standard institutions that are moneyspinners, not educational enterprises. But colleges like Bath, CASS, LSE, LBS, NUS, SMU, and NTU have tremendous value. For CAT you must prepare all year, and be judged on one exam. Since there is only one round a year, risks are high and students eventually have fewer choices. Applying to the US/UK’s top MBA programs allows for much more autonomy in the process. At the same time, you will be exposed to world-leading resources, cutting-edge facilities, global networking opportunities, and an international peer group. While it might seem scary, with the right guidance you can achieve admission to top MBA programs worldwide.

471,"The hunt for the three suspects involved in the death of a police officer in northern Illinois is still ongoing, authorities said on Tuesday. Officer Jaimie Cox, 30, was killed after he initiated a traffic stop in Rockford, about 90 miles northwest of Chicago, early Sunday. According to the Rockford Police Department, a struggle broke out and shots were fired. When backup arrived, Officer Cox was found at the scene with critical injuries. Despite being rushed to the hospital, he was pronounced dead soon after. Police later arrested a man, 49-year-old Eddie L. Patterson, on charges of obstructing justice and resisting arrest in connection with the incident. He is believed to have been in the vehicle with the suspects at the time of the traffic stop. The identities of the three suspects are still unknown, and authorities are urging anyone with information to come forward. A $35,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspects. Rockford Police Chief Dan O'Shea described Officer Cox as an ""outstanding officer"" who had ""a very bright future ahead of him."" He had been with the department for about a year and a half. ""He was an officer who loved his job, who worked very hard for the citizens of Rockford,"" O'Shea said at a press conference on Sunday. ""And it's a tragic loss not only for the Rockford Police Department, but for the community and the citizens."" Residents of Rockford have been leaving flowers and messages of support at the police department in honor of Officer Cox. A fundraising campaign has also been launched to support his family.

""We need your cooperation, we need your tips, and we'll find these individuals and bring them to justice.""","By The Associated Press Posted Sep. 1, 2015 @ 2:48 pm FOX LAKE, Ill. — Law enforcement officials broadened the hunt Wednesday for three suspects in the fatal shooting of a popular veteran police officer in a small northern Illinois community. Lake County Sheriff's Office spokesman Sgt. Christopher Covelli said hundreds of officers were involved in the exhaustive search in Fox Lake following the killing of Lt. Charles Joseph Gliniewicz on Tuesday morning. But to no avail. ""That means we're not searching within that perimeter area anymore. The suspects were not within our perimeter,"" Covelli told The Associated Press Wednesday morning. ""We had over 400 police officers out here yesterday. We had over 45 canine units and numerous aircraft,"" he said, adding that officers would now conduct ""saturation patrols"" in a wider area. Authorities from across the state and region joined the manhunt Tuesday in the village about 60 miles north of Chicago. Some wore tactical gear and toted high-powered rifles. Officers took up positions on rooftops and along railroad tracks, scanning the terrain with rifle scopes and binoculars. Others leaned out of helicopters with weapons at the ready. Federal agencies, SWAT teams and 48 police dogs assisted in the manhunt, Covelli said. Residents of the usually sleepy village were urged to stay indoors, and schools were on lockdown. In a statement late Tuesday, Covelli urged the community to reach out with tips and leads. Covelli said Gliniewicz radioed in Tuesday morning to tell dispatchers he was chasing three men on foot. Communication with him was lost soon after. Covelli said backup officers found him injured with a gunshot wound and that he died soon after. An emotional Fox Lake Mayor Donny Schmit described the slain officer as a personal friend, a three-decade member of the department and a father of four sons. ""We lost a family member,"" Schmit said of the 52-year-old officer known around town as ""GI Joe."" ''His commitment to the people of this community has been unmatched and will be dearly missed."" The area near the Wisconsin border area is popular for boating and other outdoor pursuits because of its forest preserves and a chain of lakes that partly encircles Fox Lake. Some longtime city dwellers move to the region for what is normally a quieter lifestyle. Authorities urged residents to stay home while they searched for the suspects, two of them white and the other black. Commuter train service was halted, and residents who wanted to take their dogs out to relieve themselves were told to stay inside, with the job of walking the pets handled by police officers. Several schools were locked down Tuesday, and seven cancelled classes on Wednesday, Covelli said. Gliniewicz's death is the third law enforcement fatality in Illinois this year, according to the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. It says firearms-related deaths in the U.S. are down 13 percent this year compared to the same period last year, Jan. 1. to Sept. 1; there were 30 last year and 26 this year. Fox Lake residents expressed sorrow at the death of the immensely popular Gliniewicz. ""This particular officer is a pillar in my community and (is) definitely going to be missed, and (he) touched so many lives,"" said Gina Maria, a 40-year-old teacher. Dozens gathered for hours along a street in the village to show their support for law enforcement officers. Thirty-year-old Dan Raminick, who held a sign reading ""Police Lives Matter,"" said officers came by Tuesday evening and thanked the crowd. Caitlyn Kelly, a 22-year-old student, said she felt compelled to come out after other recent police shootings. She held a sign that said ""Blue and Brave."""

The $2.1 billion, Briarwood, N.Y.-based Melrose Credit Union is giving rave reviews of its experience with the Raleigh, N.C.-based Sageworks’ new Electronic Tax Return Reader, which the credit union said helps improve underwriting efficiency. Sageworks introduced the Electronic Tax Return Reader as a major time-saving enhancement to its suite of credit risk management solutions for financial institutions. The complimentary upgrade automatically imports data from borrowers’ tax returns. “I am ecstatic with this product so far,” Steven Krauser, senior vice president of retail operations for Melrose CU, told CU Times . He explained that because the credit union's lending portfolio is so diverse, systematizing the evaluation of its underwriting process was a priority. Based on the NCUA's requirements, the credit union needed to provide the matrix for evaluating a loan in a standardized manner across all product lines. Krauser, who joined Melrose CU about a year ago, explained one of his goals was to study what the credit union could do better and began researching software that would allow him to do that. “We started in business in 1922 in taxi medallion financing,” Krauser said. “We have a significant portfolio in that. That is one reason we wanted to get involved in this.” The credit union also desired the ability to flag any problems in advance by adjusting and stress testing its portfolio, and to quantify and maintain its methodology. Melrose CU, which has an open charter and one branch, investigated which lending modules would integrate with its core system's existing data as well as standardize underwriting within its departments. The Sageworks suite, Krauser explained, allows the credit union to stress test its portfolio based on numerous factors such as loan to value, debt service coverage ratio changes and interest rate increases. The credit union started fully underwriting with the system on Aug. 4, 2015. “The quality of the underwriting analysis has increased dramatically,” Krauser pointed out, adding that the timesaving benefit will come later on. “The reason it is not there yet is that it is new and we’re still learning what to do, so there still is a learning curve.” Libby Berman, an analyst for Sageworks, said, “Our bread and butter at Sageworks has always been commercial loans and business lending, so the tax packages we support are mostly those commercial properties that accounting firms used for their businesses. We supply our financial institution clients with products that help them comply with regulations and improve their efficiency.” The Electronic Tax Return Reader works by optically “reading” electronic tax returns produced by many common tax packages, allowing for the creation of digital returns in the Sageworks system, where other financial information is also imported and stored. The program also benefits credit departments that analyze commercial real estate borrower information, as it also automatically populates Schedule E financial information for real estate properties. Sageworks said the enhancement allows credit unions to save a significant amount of time. “Our users are spending about 30 minutes per return on average, and obviously, some tax returns are much more complex with many real estate properties,” Berman pointed out. Through this program and its technology, that time can be pared down to two to three minutes, he said. “I don't know that a lot of our clients even knew this technology was feasible,” Berman added. “It has just been a recurring theme since we got into the credit analysis business, making sure that data was accurate and entered quickly. It is something people kind of expected. This will proactively solve most of those problems.” In addition to saving users time, the Electronic Tax Return Reader aims to reduce errors that can occur during the manual data entry process, and ensure consistency and accuracy during the production of commercial borrower spreads within the Sageworks Credit Analysis tool. For applicable tax returns, the technology ensures different analysts across an institution are inputting data the same way, which helps give credit unions a strong defense during exams. Berman said Sageworks also helps clients maintain consistency. “In the past, maybe there were multiple people entering data, and it is very easy to transpose numbers or enter something on the wrong line,” he explained. “The auto import helps eliminate inconsistencies and errors. The system also allows the financial institution the capability to go back in and make adjustments.” Melrose CU implemented Sageworks’ entire suite of cloud-based products about three and a half months ago, Krauser said. “Within that time, we were able to learn it, train our people, create a test site, play with it and then map our fields from our core system into the Sageworks system,” he noted. Krauser said Sageworks performs all calculations for Melrose CU. “It gives us the debt to service coverage ratio, loan to value and matrix on individual loans that we are doing, plus it gives us all the same information on global cash flow for those individuals and does it for our entire portfolio on that individual. So if you have a loan here and you are asking for a car loan, we can do the analysis on that car loan to see if it makes [financial] sense.” Currently, Melrose CU uses Sageworks’ tools for its commercial real estate department, taxi medallion lending area and business services unit. Krauser explained the credit union will eventually introduce Sageworks into its personal lending area as well, but first, it wants to gain full confidence using the tools for the largest portion of its lending business. “We have a real robust program here, and we want to make sure we have all the pieces and understand the full breadth and depth of it before we introduce it into other aspects,” Krauser said. “It is really a great automation of the process.” Scott Ogle, CEO for Sageworks, noted, “Sageworks offers solutions that simplify the complex processes that financial institutions handle every day. A key objective when developing or enhancing our solutions is to maximize time and efficiency. With our customer needs in mind, we developed the Electronic Tax Return Reader to become an integral component of each of our banking solutions, as it will save hours of manual data entry over the life of the solution.” Sageworks Credit Analysis allows credit unions to book loans faster, and with consistency and transparency, while also managing risk, the company said. The global cash flow analysis solution presents tax return input screens that create spreads, dynamic narrative analysis and customizable credit memos. “This is also important to those credit unions that are getting into more member business lending, who may not feel they have the right staff in place,” Berman asserted. “They can use a program like this to take care of some of the more manual work and allocate time more effectively to the actual analysis.” Berman pointed out the credit analysis tool also helps credit unions prepare for exams, especially those that had trouble in the past with credit decision inconsistencies and file errors."
475,"Tenneco Inc., a leading global supplier of clean-air and ride-performance products and systems, has announced the launch of its latest generation electronic valve technology, designed to improve fuel efficiency and engine performance while reducing emissions for vehicles. The patented “Intelligent Valve Actuation” (IVA) technology uses advanced electronics to control engine intake and exhaust valves, optimizing combustion and reducing energy losses in the engine. This approach helps to reduce fuel consumption, while cutting emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. “Tenneco has a long history of innovation and a strong commitment to developing technologies that help our customers meet their sustainability goals,” said Brian Kesseler, Tenneco’s CEO. “Our latest IVA technology is a great example of this, and we are excited to bring this important solution to market.” The IVA technology is compatible with a wide range of engines, including gasoline, diesel, and natural gas, and can be easily integrated into existing engine designs.

477,"Leading insurance broker Willis UK has partnered with AIG to launch a new automatically renewing policy for mid-market businesses. Dubbed the ""Mid-Market Solution,"" the new policy offers clients the benefit of automatic renewal, enabling them to focus on running their businesses, rather than worrying about policy renewals. The policy will cover areas such as property damage, business interruption, and employers' liability, among others. According to a joint statement released by Willis UK and AIG, the Mid-Market Solution is designed to cater to the needs of mid-sized businesses that require bespoke insurance solutions. The policy will offer comprehensive coverage, with the option to add additional modules to meet specific business requirements. One of the key benefits of the Mid-Market Solution is its streamlined approach to policy renewal. With the policy renewing automatically each year, clients can be assured that they remain covered, without the stress of having to remember renewal dates or go through the arduous process of reapplying for coverage. Commenting on the launch of the new policy, Willis UK CEO, Sarah Turvill, said, ""We are delighted to launch the Mid-Market Solution as part of our continued commitment to developing innovative insurance products that meet the evolving needs of our clients. By offering automatic renewal, this policy ensures businesses can focus on their operations, with the peace of mind that they are protected against unforeseen circumstances."" David McMillan, UK CEO of AIG, added, ""We are pleased to collaborate with Willis UK to launch this new solution that meets the needs of mid-market businesses with dedicated, tailored insurance coverage. We believe the automatic renewal feature exemplifies how the insurance industry can evolve to deliver products that meet the demands of modern businesses."" The Mid-Market Solution policy is available to businesses across multiple sectors, with coverage limits ranging from £5m to £100m. The policy will be underwritten by AIG and sold through Willis UK's distribution network.","Willis Group Holdings and American International Group, Inc. have launched “Evergreen,” described as “an innovative, new approach to insurance that removes the need for annual policy renewal – the first UK mid-market offering with no renewal date that covers major insurance classes under one contract.” The new product, developed by Willis and underwritten by AIG, “continues indefinitely, reduces frictional costs and cuts out time consuming administration at renewal,” the announcement said. “Regular reviews ensure the correct level of protection is maintained at all times, complemented by risk management support.” Evergreen also provides a six month cancellation clause, which “gives clients greater flexibility and freedom compared to a traditional annual insurance policy that cannot be cancelled after inception.” Nicolas Aubert, CEO of Willis GB, described Evergreen as an “evolution of the insurance policy;” adding that it “represents real innovation in the way we service our mid-market clients. It provides all the benefits of standard insurance but removes the requirement for an annual renewal. “In turn, this frees up time – for the client and their risk partner – to focus exclusively on understanding the business critical risk issues. Our clients are looking for solutions that add real value to their organizations. Evergreen does just that. It forms part of our commitment to offer our clients the best and most innovative solutions available that will build resilience so they can realize their ambitions.” Jacqueline McNamee, UK Managing Director of AIG, stressed the “innovative solutions” represented by the policy; adding that it was created “in partnership with brokers.” It provides both risk management and reduces “administrative costs associated with the annual renewal process.” She also indicated that the policy not only delivers “more value to the customer but it further strengthens their relationships with their broker and insurer by embedding the discipline of reviewing their insurance and risk management needs when change occurs not just for an annual renewal.” Source: Willis Group Holdings"

479,"Tennis superstar Serena Williams has managed to overcome a scare in the second round of the US Open to progress to the next round of the tournament. The 39-year-old American faced a tough challenge against Russian player Margarita Gasparyan, but eventually emerged victorious in three hard-fought sets, winning 6-2, 6-7 (5), 6-2. Williams, who has won the US Open on six previous occasions and is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, got off to a strong start in the match, taking the first set comfortably. However, Gasparyan fought back strongly in the second set, pushing Williams to the brink and even managing to take the set in a closely contested tiebreak. Despite the setback, Williams remained focused and gradually regained control of the match in the third set, breaking Gasparyan's serve twice to clinch victory. Speaking after the match, Williams praised her opponent's performance and admitted that she had been pushed to her limits. ""I think she played really well, especially in that second set,"" Williams said. ""I had to really dig deep and stay focused to come through that one."" Despite her tough start to the tournament, Williams remains one of the favorites to go all the way and win her seventh US Open title. The American will now face another Russian player, 32nd seed Yaroslava Shvedova, in the third round. Williams will no doubt be hoping for a more straightforward match in the next round, but she will undoubtedly be prepared for another tough challenge against a talented opponent. The US Open is the final Grand Slam of the year, and this year's event has been subject to numerous changes and restrictions due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, despite these challenges, the tournament has managed to attract a star-studded field of players, including Williams, Novak Djokovic, Naomi Osaka, and Roger Federer. The event is being held without fans in attendance, in order to reduce the risk of spreading the virus. The US Open runs until September 13, and fans around the world will be eagerly watching to see if Serena Williams can once again come out on top and add another major title to her impressive collection.","Serena Williams survived an early scare to beat Holland's Kiki Bertens in straight sets at the US Open and keep her calendar grand slam dream alive. Williams has made a habit of dramatic comebacks this year and the American did it again on Arthur Ashe, fighting back from 5-3 and then 4-0 in the tie-break to clinch the opening set. Bertens was unable to recover as Williams found her groove to seal a 7-6 (7/5) 6-3 victory and book a third-round clash with Bethanie Mattek-Sands. It means Williams is now five wins away from becoming the first female player since 1988 to hold all four major titles in a single year. Williams came from a set down four times en route to the French Open crown this year and memorably overturned Heather Watson's 3-0 final set lead in the third round at Wimbledon. Bertens' advantage was never quite as commanding but for the best part of an hour she troubled her opponent, who struggled for rhythm, particularly on her serve. ""I took it one point at a time in the tie-break and next thing I knew it was 4-4,"" Williams said. ""It doesn't worry me, being down a lot, I know I can try to make a comeback. ""I never stop, I keep going and give it the best effort I can."" Bertens has never gone past the second round at Flushing Meadows before but the 23-year-old showed few signs of nerves early on, blasting her way to a break and 5-3 lead. Serving for the set, however, the world number 110 wobbled with a double fault and Williams instantly pounced, breaking back and forcing a tie-break. Bertens pressed ahead again, hammering away a forehand winner for 4-0 but back came Williams again, losing just one point in eight to take the opening set. ""I've been really relaxed usually, today I was a little tight,"" Williams said. Promoted stories ""It showed a bit but hopefully I can get back to where I was before."" The second set was more straightforward for the world number one, but she will be eager to restore her usually reliable serve, which produced 10 double faults, against American wildcard Mattek-Sands in round three. Mattek-Sands had earlier defeated compatriot Coco Vandeweghe 6-2 6-1. ""Bethanie's really good, she has a very aggressive game,"" Williams said.

483,"Washington D.C. has been grappling with a growing problem - a health crisis that appears to be linked to the use of synthetic drugs. Synthetic drugs, also known as designer drugs or legal highs, are designed to mimic the effects of illegal drugs like cocaine, ecstasy and marijuana. But these drugs are not necessarily safe, and now D.C. officials are scrambling to find a solution. At the heart of the crisis is the fact that synthetic drugs are difficult to test, regulate and control. They are sold in small packets, often labeled as ""not for human consumption,"" and are typically marketed as legal alternatives to banned substances. However, these drugs are often laced with unknown and untested compounds, which can have dangerous and unpredictable effects on the body. In D.C., the problem has been compounded by the fact that these drugs are easily accessible. They are sold at convenience stores, gas stations, and online retailers. And because they are relatively cheap, they appeal to all parts of society – from high school students to homeless veterans. The effects of synthetic drugs can be devastating. In some cases, they have been known to cause seizures, hallucinations, and even death. And because the compounds used in these drugs are constantly changing, it can be difficult for medical professionals to know how to treat patients who have taken them. But the problem is not just limited to D.C. Synthetics have become a nationwide epidemic. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), synthetic drugs are the second-most commonly used drug among high school seniors, behind only marijuana. And while the use of other drugs, like heroin and prescription opioids, are on the decline, the use of synthetics is on the rise. While there is no easy answer to the problem of synthetics, there are some steps that can be taken to reduce their use and associated harm. One solution is to increase education and awareness programs about the dangers of synthetic drugs. By informing the public about the risks of these substances, it may be possible to dissuade potential users from experimenting with them. Another solution is to ramp up regulatory measures. In D.C., officials are considering legislation that would make it illegal to sell or distribute synthetic drugs. This would greatly limit the availability of these drugs and make it easier for law enforcement to crack down on dealers. Finally, medical professionals need to be educated about synthetics so that they can better diagnose and treat patients who have taken these drugs. More research is also needed to better understand the chemicals behind synthetic drugs and their impact on the body. The crisis in D.C. is a symptom of a larger issue. Synthetic drugs are a growing problem across the country and pose a significant health threat to young people and those struggling with addiction. The only way to solve this problem is to work together to find a solution that reduces demand and increases safety.","The emergent problem of the dangerous drugs known as synthetics has been featured in several recent media accounts. Their use has grown strikingly, and because of their association with violent behavior, so has law enforcement concern. The rising trend was shown in reports of emergency episodes attributed to “synthetic cannabinoids” by the District of Columbia Fire and EMS departments. Episodes had been stable at fewer than fifty cases a month from August, 2012, until roughly November of that year, when they spiked to over a hundred. That number subsided until approximately January of 2015, when they began an unprecedented, and persisting, climb. By June of 2014, the last data point captured, they reached 439 cases, an apparent increase of nearly 800 percent since the end of the year. Our attention has been triggered by some horrendous episodes involving consumption of synthetics, including an alleged stabbing death that has the city, already known for far greater use of the synthetic hallucinogen PCP among arrestees than other major cities, on edge. Has some underlying factor driven synthetic cannabinoid use in the nation’s Capital, as shown by these emergency episodes? What has changed that could affect either drug availability, or the acceptability of increased use, of this dangerous set of compounds? There is a correlation found in the timing. In November of 2014, District voters made news by approving legal “natural” cannabinoid use in the city – that is, marijuana. Then, in January of this year, the legalization took effect, with an increase in public consumption, while police backed away. Both developments seem to be echoed in the data. We must confront a disturbing question: by allowing “natural” marijuana to increase in acceptance, could the District have sowed the wind of the synthetic cannabis whirlwind? Advocates for drug legalization recognize that connection, but their response is the predictable resort of pro-marijuana advocates. Legalizers explain the increased use of synthetics as a consequence of the prohibition on “natural cannabis.” But that had ended just before the epidemic began. So how could prohibition be forcing the problem? The response from legalizers is revealing, as it discloses their next target in District policies: workplace drug testing. Since many synthetic users believe that they are not readily detected by potential employers, they must be substituting them for the “natural” marijuana product. So for legalizers, it is still the “punitive criminal justice system” that somehow incentivizes use of dangerous synthetic toxins. As they perennially argue, it is our crack-down on marijuana that drives consumers to more dangerous drugs. For advocates, the problem with marijuana legalization in the District is not that it led to a disturbing shift in the attitudes and norms of drugs use. It’s that it didn’t go far enough. We didn’t legalize sales, as well as use. And employers (like the Federal Government) still insist on drug-testing applicants. And because drug users want jobs, they have to use synthetics. Oddly, before November when “natural marijuana” was prohibited, this argument failed; there was then no spike in synthetic use, even though marijuana users were still, as now, subjected to drug tests. The legalizer solution? Legalize marijuana sales, but most importantly, eliminate workplace testing. That will surely end the demand for synthetics. It’s possible that the cause of the current epidemic is, as legalizers argue, this complicated incentive effect. But isn’t it simpler, and more faithful to the data, to posit that the District made a huge, predictable mistake when it opened the flood gates to legalized marijuana, and thereby shifted the entire drug using landscape towards an epidemic? The argument is not far-fetched. Perceptions and norms of disapproval matter for those contemplating drug use, and survey data are clear that for youth, there is a strong correlation between one prior behavior and use of synthetic drugs. Data from a study overseen by the National Institute of Drug Abuse showed that the use of “natural” marijuana is, in fact, a “gateway” for synthetic use. In fact, the use of synthetics by those who hadn’t previously used marijuana is 0.5 percent; that is, almost never. The true common sense understanding of the tragedy happening right before us is that the District of Columbia, by legalizing marijuana, produced a completely predictable effect. It made drug use more acceptable, and rendered police control more difficult. Sadly, as drugs of all sorts begin to flood the streets, the District is experiencing a rapidly-unfolding train wreck, of its own devising."
484,"Stepping out to bring young William Tyrrell home The disappearance of William Tyrrell from his grandmother's backyard in Kendall, NSW, over six years ago remains one of Australia's most heart-wrenching missing child cases. While there have been numerous investigations, searches, and appeals for information, the little boy's whereabouts remain a mystery. However, the community hasn't given up hope and continues to step out to bring young William Tyrrell home. On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in Taree, NSW, for a march and a rally marking William's seventh birthday. The event, named ""Step Forward for William,"" was organized by the local community to show support for William's family and keep the case in the public eye. The march, which started at Queen Elizabeth Park and ended at Taree's Victoria Street Pedestrian Bridge, was led by a group of motorcyclists known as the ""Knights of the Northern Crusade."" The motorcyclists, who have supported William's family since his disappearance, wore yellow ribbons and T-shirts with the message ""Never Give Up Hope."" The crowd cheered and clapped as William's father, Brendan Collins, thanked everyone for their support and urged anyone with information to come forward. ""We need your help more than ever,"" he said. ""We need to bring William home."" The rally, which followed the march, was held at Taree's Central Park and featured speeches from community leaders, volunteers, and family members. The event also included a balloon release, a moment of silence for William, and the singing of ""Happy Birthday."" Yellow ribbons, balloons, and banners with messages of hope and support were everywhere. The ""Step Forward for William"" event was one of many similar initiatives organized by communities in New South Wales and across Australia to raise awareness about William's case and keep the focus on finding him. While it may seem like a small step, every effort to keep the case in the public eye and keep the hope alive is important. For the families of missing children, the pain never goes away, and the search for answers never ends. William's case has touched the hearts of Australians and people around the world who have been following the story and hoping for a positive outcome. While it's been a challenging journey for William's family, they remain thankful for the support of the community and the tireless efforts of the police and volunteer search teams. As the search for William Tyrrell continues, the community will keep stepping out to make sure he is never forgotten and to bring him home.","MUMS, dads and children at locations across the Sunshine Coast set off on a walk with one common mission: to bring William Tyrrell home. Similar events were also held across Australia at the same time, 10.30am yesterday. Exactly a year earlier, three-year-old boy William Tyrrell (pictured) was taken from his grandmother's home in Kendall, on the New South Wales mid-north coast. While there have been reports of sightings, the little boy, who disappeared wearing his favourite Spiderman costume, has not yet been found. He would now be four. A group of Coolum locals organised their own Walk for William, starting at Tickle Park and walking along the beachside cliffs to Point Perry. Despite the grey weather at least 150 walkers participated yesterday. Christina and Riley Clifford. Walkers wore red and blue in recognition of William's favourite superhero, and many kids - as well as organiser Angela Gray - donned full-length Spiderman suits. Ms Gray said the Walk for William idea was intended to ""make the community take note"". ""We will not sweep him under the carpet,"" she said to the crowd. ""We will keep onto this until he is brought home or until somebody is brought to justice. ""He is a little boy, like all of the kids here. He should be at home with his parents. ""Ours is a simple one in Coolum but it is in respect for William."" Organiser Angie Dunbavan said she hoped the various walks would jog someone's memory about the disappearance, or compel those with information to come forward. She said it also represented a chance for parents to start a conversation about safety with their children. ""It's a really good opportunity to raise community awareness around stranger danger,"" she said. ""About how to protect yourself as a child, and what parents can do to be more vigilant."" Yaroomba mum Christina Clifford attended the event with her son Riley, who turned three last week, the same age William was when he disappeared. Mrs Clifford said William's disappearance had hit her ""straight to the heart"". ""I just cried and cried,"" she said. ""Australia should be a safe environment to just let kids be kids, and taking advantage of a little three-year-old, it makes me sick in my guts, basically."" She said she was trying to talk to Riley about William during the walk. ""I'm trying now to explain to him what we're doing here, but it's not easy to explain to a three-year-old,"" she said. ""He keeps saying 'where is William, we have to try and find William'."""

489,"Manuel Pellegrini, manager of Manchester City, expressed his disappointment with his team's defensive errors during their 1-0 loss to West Ham on Saturday. City dominated possession throughout the game, but were unable to convert their chances into goals. Instead, it was West Ham who scored the only goal of the match, with midfielder Declan Rice heading in a corner kick in the 56th minute. Pellegrini pointed to defensive errors as the reason for his team's defeat. Speaking to reporters after the match, he said, ""We conceded a goal that was completely unnecessary. It was a corner kick where we didn't mark properly, and that was the only thing they did in the whole game to create a chance. We dominated the game but couldn't score, and then we conceded a goal that we shouldn't have conceded."" The defeat was Manchester City's second of the season, and leaves them six points behind Liverpool in the Premier League table. Pellegrini insisted, however, that his team would continue to fight for the title. ""We're just getting started in the league,"" he said. ""Of course we're disappointed with the result today, but we have to keep going and focus on the next game."" The Chilean manager also praised West Ham's defensive display, claiming that the London club ""defended well and played with a lot of intensity"" throughout the match. Manchester City will now turn their attention to the Champions League, where they face Dinamo Zagreb in a group stage clash on Tuesday. Pellegrini acknowledged that the European competition is a priority for his team, saying, ""We have to focus on the Champions League now. That's our main objective."" The defeat to West Ham is sure to raise questions about Manchester City's defense, which has now conceded 10 goals in the Premier League this season. Pellegrini, however, remained positive, insisting that his team's defensive issues can be addressed. ""We have to learn from our mistakes and work on the training pitch to improve,"" he said. ""I have confidence in my players and I know that we can get better."" Despite the disappointment of the defeat, Manchester City can take some solace from the fact that they still have a long season ahead of them. With the Champions League and domestic cup competitions still to come, Pellegrini and his team will have plenty of opportunities to bounce back from their setback at the hands of West Ham. As for West Ham, their victory over Manchester City will boost their confidence for the rest of the season. The London club are now in eighth place in the Premier League table, and will be looking to build on their success when they take on Bournemouth next weekend. For now, though, they can savor their triumph over one of the best teams in the league.","Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini highlighted defensive lapses after West Ham condemned his side to their first Barclays Premier League defeat of the season. City's run of five successive league wins without conceding came to an abrupt halt as Victor Moses and Diafra Sakho set up a 2-1 win the for the Hammers at the Etihad Stadium. Club record signing Kevin de Bruyne pulled one back before the hosts went on to dominate the second half, but they could not find a way past inspired goalkeeper Adrian. It was a second defeat for City in the space of four days after losing to Juventus in the Champions League in midweek. Pellegrini said: ""It was frustrating because I think they were three very important points here at home. ""We conceded two easy goals and that maybe was one of the reasons why we didn't win. ""In the last two games, we didn't play with the concentration and intensity we need in defending. ""Juventus shot twice at our goal and they scored two goals. Today it was exactly the same. One shot at the edge of the box and one corner were all the offensive volume West Ham had in the whole game. ""We must concentrate more because two balls decided the result."" City had to make a late change to the side after playmaker David Silva withdrew before kick-off. Pellegrini said: ""I don't want to have the excuse of David Silva why we didn't win. I don't think there was one player that would change the story. ""David had a kick in his calf and he tried in the warm-up but he felt his muscle was stiff so he didn't play."" Pellegrini, who added that defender Eliaquim Mangala was taken off at half-time with a muscle injury, dismissed suggestions his team may have been over-confident. Promoted stories He said: ""We never believed that because we won five games we were the champions of the Premier League. ""We have to play 32 games more, 96 points to play for, so nobody can believe that."" For West Ham, the result represented another notable away scalp under new boss Slaven Bilic after also winning at Arsenal and Liverpool. Bilic said: ""It is a surprise, let's be honest. This game was different from Emirates and Anfield. With the greatest respect to Liverpool and Arsenal, this team (City) are the best in the league. ""We knew we would have to score goals to get something, we knew we would have to run like crazy, and we knew would have to be lucky. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to stop them for 90 minutes but we have done it. ""We didn't nick it. It would have been fair if they equalised, but we also had chances. ""That is why I am so proud of our performance. The guys have done brilliantly, not only fighting-wise but also playing-wise."" The Hammers now have 12 points from their six games, just three less than leaders City, but Bilic is not getting carried away. He said: ""There is a tiny line between confidence and arrogance or confidence and laziness. Share article ""It is hard not to get carried away a little but that is also part of my job to install in their heads that we are good, but that you have to know what to do to stay good. ""There are going to be ups and downs, we are not Real Madrid, but it is looking very good now."""

492,"The Bulldogs' women's team has been gaining momentum lately, and they are a force to be reckoned with in the sports world. This team is unlike any other, as they have taken the sport of basketball to a whole new level. Let's meet the players and see what makes them so unique. First up is the team captain, Sarah Johnson. She has been playing basketball for 10 years and continues to show strong leadership skills on and off the court. Sarah's dedication and hard work are evident in every game, and she inspires her teammates to do the same. Next, we have the point guard, Emily Davis. She is a skilled player, with a natural ability to read the court and make quick decisions. Emily's speed and agility make her an essential asset to the team. Moving on to the shooting guard, we have Olivia Brown. Olivia's shooting accuracy is unmatched, and she always manages to find the basket with ease. Her technique and confidence make her a player to watch out for. At the small forward position is Grace Thompson. Grace's speed and agility make her an excellent defender, and she always manages to steal the ball from her opponents. Her energy and determination on the court are second to none. Playing the power forward position is Jane Smith. Jane is a versatile player, with the ability to score points and defend the basket. Her height advantage and strength make her a valuable asset to the team. Last but not least is the center, Emma Wilson. Emma's height and strength make her dominant on the court, and her ability to block shots is unmatched. Her presence in the key is a challenge for any opposing team. These players may come from different backgrounds and have different playing styles, but they all have one thing in common - their love for basketball. They train hard every day, putting in hours of hard work to improve their game. But the Bulldogs' women's team is more than just their skills on the court. They have a strong sense of community and support for each other. They are like a family, always there for one another both on and off the court. Their coach, Jessica Wilson, has also played a crucial role in the team's success. Her strategic approach to the game and her focus on teamwork has helped the team grow and improve significantly. She has created a positive environment that encourages hard work and dedication. The Bulldogs' women's team has been making waves in the sports world lately. They recently won the regional basketball tournament, beating some of the toughest teams in the league. They have also been recognized for their contributions to the community, volunteering their time for local charities and organizations. It is safe to say that the Bulldogs' women's team is a force to be reckoned with. They have proved themselves time and time again, not only as skilled players but also as dedicated individuals who have a passion for the game and a strong sense of community. Their success has inspired many young girls to take up the sport and follow in their footsteps. The Bulldogs' women's team has shown that with hard work and determination, anything is possible.","Read comprehensive player profiles on all the Milton Ulladulla Bulldogs WLT players for 2015. Read a full WLT preview here. Read the highlights from the 2014 grand final here. THE Milton-Ulladulla Bulldogs will attempt to do what no women’s league tag team has done in the competition’s history. The Bulldogs hope to claim successive Group 7 premierships, when they take on Kiama at Collegians Sporting Complex on Sunday. Bulldogs' captain Cheyanne Hatch said she was so proud that her team was the only team in the entire senior Group 7 competition to remain undefeated in the 2015 season. The Bulldogs women have the best defence points in the competition, although Cheyanne said this adds even more pressure for Sunday's grand final. ""We aren't going into the game too cocky but we are confident we can take it out,"" she said. ""As a captain, and on behalf of my Dad as coach, we have every bit of belief in every single one of the girls. ""The difference between us and any other team this year is we play as a team, as one and for each other."" Cheyanne added that there is no better feeling than playing alongside her best friends and sharing the laughs and exciting memories each week with the Bulldogs family. ""It will be a tough game against our rivalry Kiama, as every game this year against them has been so close,"" she said. ""We have almost climbed our mountain and are prepared to come out firing for Sunday's game to reach that mountain and do the Milton Ulladulla Bulldogs club, supporters, families and ourselves proud."" Kick off for the women is 8.30am with the gates open at 7.30am. Admission is $15 for adults, $9 for concession and children under 16 are free. So, without further adieu, meet the 2015 Bulldogs women. After taking out Group 7’s and Milton Ulladulla’s top point scorer and most tries scored in 2014, Ebony has had yet again a massive season. Eb was not able to back up her titles due to missing out on five games because of being overseas, but she is still second in the competition with 14 tries, 45 goals and a total of 146 points. Back in time for the finals, Eb is ready to help the girls get the win with her swerving attack and 100 per cent kicking abilities – a standout in the team and best fullback in the competition by far. The hips of the team! Georgia’s second year with the doggies, she says there is no better way to spend her weekends than travelling down the coast to play. Georgia is unstoppable and does not stop swiveling her hips! Georgia is always hard to tag and will be using her hip swivel to break the line in Sunday’s game. Georgia has played years and years of Oztag and this will show come Sunday! Currently representing NSW CHS at the national touch football championships (also leading try scorer up in QLD), Taryn will be landing back just in time for the WLT grand final. A little weapon, nothing will stop her! Daughter of the Bulldogs' first grade coach Orbit (who wishes he could sign a deal with Taryn), she shines every week with her speed and fast pace, making herself impossible to catch. Taryn was put into the fullback role while Ebony was away and plays like Jarryd Hayne; anywhere on the field, any position. Paige is known as the Robbie Farah of the team. Paige is the ‘go forward’ and helps to get the girls on a role. Her ball movement throughout the middle of the field and non-stop communication will be important in Sunday’s game. She is the team’s motivation and has filled the team with positivity the whole season! There are never any heads dropped while Paigey is around. Paige's loud mouth and positive energy will help push the girls and get them fired and pumped ready to go. One of Paige’s biggest achievements this year is being the only player to kick a 40/20! Amy was born in Milton hospital and is a life-long sporting achiever, representing several teams at higher levels. It is Amy’s third year with the Bulldogs, and she will be hoping to win a back-to-back premiership alongside the girls. Amy’s sporting experience will be a big impact on this weekend's game. Amy is a versatile player and an important utility, able to play any position in both attack and defence to continually stand out. Look out for her superman dives in defence and dodging stepping attack. Cheyanne Hatch is the captain and leader of this great side. Cheyanne is the daughter of coach David Hatch, who has not only played years with the Cronulla Sharks and Australia, he has captained and coached more than 20 different teams. Cheyanne is a huge threat in the Bulldogs side and has led the girls now into two grand finals. She says she is so proud to be undefeated minor premiers but the job is not done until this Sunday. Her experience from years representing various representative touch football and Oz Tag sides will be shown on Sunday when the girls defend their premiership. Cheyanne was also awarded Group 7 Player of the year for 2014, which was picked from all teams in the competition. Also daughter of the Bulldogs' first grade coach, Orbit, Jaylee will be wearing the red, blue and white representing the doggies with pride. Born a true Milton Ulladulla Bulldog, she is one of our strongest link/wingers. Jaylee never-give-up attitude and improvement this year has been outstanding. She continues to impress her team mates in every game and is a well respected player in this team. Her best game was when the Bulldogs defeated Kiama in the semi-final two weeks ago, where she has battle scars from diving and defending non-stop. Jaylee not only has the height of the team but is always positively lifting the girls up as a team. After breaking her collarbone in the first game last year, the determination of this little skillful player proves that nothing would stop her return. Without older sister Kaela Thomas (who was a stand out in last year's grand final), Georgia has really stepped up. She has moves up her sleeve she plans to use on Sunday. She has represented Australia in Oztag for several years and again her experience at a higher level will be important for Sunday’s game. Georgia’s grubber kicks for herself and for the other girls attacking the line will be a strong point for the Doggies. Getting mistaken for Shaun Johnson and Roger Tuivasa Sheck, Ana has developed so much as a player this year. One of the Dogs' ball players, she sets up a lot of plays and does not miss a tag in defence. She loves the Bulldogs and says her favourite part of playing is spending her weekends with her best friends. Her best memory was winning the grand final last year and being a part of the Bulldogs family. Ana’s hip movements and non-stop defence will play an important role for the girls. On debut for the Bulldogs this year, Rachel was always a touch head but decided she would give league tag a crack. Rachel has improved immensely since game one and continues to surprise each game. League tag is not an easy game, but Rachel with her freakish nature and natural ability with a football was able to pick up the game straight away. Rachel’s ball movement from left to right is her biggest strength in the game and this will help trick the defence in Sunday's game. Emmah has grown up playing soccer her whole life but decided she would give league tag a try. She has loved every aspect of the game so far, and with her speed and long legs Emmah is hoping to play her best in Sunday's game. It is Emmah’s second year playing with the Bulldogs and every game she is determined to play her best and gives 100 per cent - that’s what the team loves about her! Emmah was awarded player of the grand final last year, which was also her favourite Bulldogs memory. Jess is the Bulldogs' backup goal kicker and was lucky enough to be put into the goal kicking role while Ebony was away. With big shoes to fill, Jess had no worries of filling them, having a lot of strength behind her boot thanks to her soccer background. One of the Bulldogs' strongest wingers in the team, her teammates have every bit of confidence in Jess defending, as she drops back to support the fullback and attacking the line out wide. Do not let Jess into open space as she will be very hard to catch. This year was Tessa’s first year with the Bulldogs. She began looking up to her partner Stein Lofts (a Bulldogs first grade player of more than 17 years) and he has taught her a thing or two. However she is now teaching him how she uses those hips of hers to break through the defenders. Tessa is definitely the team's best hole runner by far. Tessa came into the team not knowing any of the girls well, now she is happy to say she has made 16 new friends and there is no better feeling playing alongside such a great bunch of girls. Emily is also away representing NSWCCC at the National touch Champions, making it back in time for Sunday's game. Only 17-years-old, Emily is one of the strongest and fastest players across the park. It is her first year with the Bulldogs, and what a great sign up she was. Scoring a try almost every game, Emily is a little superstar! Emily was named in the Youth Rugby Union Australian 7’s side and this can be shown through her speed and agility on the field. She never stops smiling and puts in the gutsiest effort every game. Emily’s favourite Bulldog moment was becoming minor premiers and she hopes to win her first premiership this Sunday, in turn helping the majority of the girls make it their second. Another newbie of the team, Hannah has showed the whole season what playing tag is about. Also only 17-years-old and an Australia Oztag representative, Hannah is the Bulldogs' weapon and will be a dark horse on Sunday. She is planning on coming out strong and giving the other team a run for their money. Hannah is also a try scoring machine and played her best game against Culburra, scoring herself six tries in one game. Hannah bounces off the defence with her fast hips; she should be hard to tag. It is Kiarna’s third year with the Doggies and she is also hoping to win a back-to-back premiership. From day one Kiarna has been a part of the team, and not only her team mates, but also the coach have seen nothing but continuous improvements. She plays rugby league, which can be shown through her aggression. Kiarna’s great communication and non-stop talking will help the girls in Sunday's game. Cousin of Taryn and Jaylee, this awesome trio will be making the Love family proud on Sunday. A late sign-up into the team, this year is Riarnne’s first time playing tag. Being on debut, Riarnne has improved so much since game one. Her great attitude and positive influences on the girls will be important in Sunday's game. The rest of the team cannot wait to share the grand final experience with Riarnne."
493,"The United Nations' Agenda 2030, also known as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), is vital to the future of the Asia-Pacific region. The SDGs were adopted by world leaders in 2015 to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all. Asia-Pacific is the world's most populous region and home to some of the fastest-growing economies. Rapid economic growth has brought significant improvements in poverty reduction and well-being, but it has also led to environmental degradation, income inequality, and other challenges. To address these challenges, the Asia-Pacific region must implement the SDGs. The goals cover a wide range of issues, from poverty and hunger to climate change and peace and justice. Achieving the SDGs requires concerted efforts from governments, civil society, and the private sector. One of the SDGs' core components is eradicating poverty. Despite Asia-Pacific's impressive economic growth, millions of people still live in extreme poverty. The SDGs aim to lift people out of poverty by creating jobs, promoting education, and reducing inequality. The region must also address the challenge of hunger. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), more than half of the world's undernourished people live in Asia-Pacific. The SDGs call for sustainable agriculture and improved food systems to ensure that everyone has access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food. The SDGs also prioritize environmental protection, recognizing the importance of safeguarding natural resources for future generations. The Asia-Pacific region is home to some of the world's most biodiverse ecosystems, but it is also one of the most vulnerable regions to the impacts of climate change. The SDGs call for urgent action to mitigate climate change and adapt to its effects. In addition, the SDGs emphasize the importance of peace, justice, and strong institutions. Many countries in the Asia-Pacific region face issues such as corruption, human rights abuses, and political instability. The SDGs aim to promote peaceful and inclusive societies, strengthen the rule of law, and ensure that everyone has access to justice. The private sector also plays a crucial role in achieving the SDGs. Businesses can create jobs, bring innovative solutions, and promote sustainable practices. Many companies in the Asia-Pacific region have already committed to supporting the SDGs through their operations and supply chains. The SDGs' success depends on strong partnerships between governments, civil society, and the private sector. Governments must provide the necessary policies and frameworks to support the SDGs, while civil society can hold them accountable and work towards community involvement. The private sector can bring its resources, expertise, and innovation to support the SDGs. The Asia-Pacific region has made significant progress towards achieving the SDGs, but much work remains. For example, while the number of people living in extreme poverty has declined, income inequality has increased in many countries. The region must also address the challenge of gender inequality, with many women facing discrimination and limited opportunities. In conclusion, the SDGs are vital to the future of the Asia-Pacific region. Achieving the goals requires a collective effort from all sectors of society. By working together, the region can create a sustainable and prosperous future for all.","The resounding endorsement by global leaders last week in New York of the groundbreaking and transformational 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, more than two years in the making, sparks new hope and optimism for multilateralism. The 2030 Agenda, based on 17 goals and 169 targets, may seem overly ambitious to some, but poverty eradication cannot be sustained without comprehensive progress in economic growth, social justice and ecological sustainability. This is a bold and inspirational new roadmap that will guide us to more sustainable growth, which is resource-efficient and respects planetary boundaries－meeting our present needs without mortgaging the wellbeing of future generations. This change is urgently needed in the countries of Asia and the Pacific. Although our region has an impressive track record of economic growth and poverty reduction, more than 1.4 billion people still live in poverty, social disparities are widening and growth remains inefficient and wasteful. Our region has a shared responsibility to lead, which is why mainstreaming the 2030 Agenda in development plans and budgets, and backing them with strong oversight will be critical for successful implementation. Five conditions must be met to pave the way for Asia-Pacific governments to make this happen: First, sufficient financial resources are needed. The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) estimates that the Asia-Pacific region will need to invest between $2.1 trillion and $2.5 trillion per year to fund a comprehensive agenda for sustainable development. These resources are available: regional national savings total nearly $8.9 trillion, financial assets of the wealthiest regional individuals are estimated to be about $35 trillion, and foreign exchange reserves account for more than $7 trillion. Most of these sources of savings are currently adding to liquidity, held dormant in deposits or financing third-party country deficits. We need instead to effectively harness them along with unwavering political commitment to exploit domestic resources for development. Developing economies of our region have, on an average, among the lowest tax-to-GDP ratios in the world. Leveraging the potential of strengthened tax regimes is key; public interest must override the vested interests so that governments can remove tax exemptions and tackle tax evasion practices which are obstacles to investment in better access to basic services. Second, good governance and inclusion has to be embedded in policy execution and implementation. The capacities of governments to engage multiple interest groups with widely varying perspectives, to effectively regulate excesses, monitor policy impacts and adjust policy responses are now critical. Governments must also become more adept at dealing with the unexpected and unpredictable events－and enabling all groups in society to respond positively to environmental, economic or social shocks. Third, innovations, new technologies and associated know-how must drive sustainable development across the region, yet innovation gaps in Asia and the Pacific remain very large. Only five Asia-Pacific countries are featured in the top 20 of the 2014 Global Innovation Index. Effective alignment and reinforcement of science, technology and innovation, through the right policies and regulatory frameworks as well as partnerships to facilitate technology transfer, will be mission-critical for successful sustainability. Fourth, we need to pair innovation with resources, enabling countries to find and adapt the best policy options for sustainability. Partnerships and stronger, more diversified regional platforms for South-South cooperation, such as those provided by ESCAP and its Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development, provide great opportunities for our region to lead the way in ending poverty, transforming lives and protecting the planet. Fifth, climate action must be integrated across all areas of policy and governance－social, environmental and economic. While emissions must be reduced through a focus on low-carbon energy, transportation and buildings and through energy efficiency, we must also build more resilient societies, prepared for frequent and extreme weather events and their impacts, such as changes in food production systems and migration.

494,"Fall is officially here, and with it comes the annual obsession with all things pumpkin spice. From lattes to candles to even dog treats, it seems that everything these days comes in a variation of the autumnal flavor. But has the pumpkin spice trend gone too far? Here are six ways in which we might have overdone it with pumpkin spice. 1. Pumpkin spice isn't just for Halloween anymore. It feels like the pumpkin spice obsession starts earlier and earlier every year. With the flavor appearing in grocery stores as early as August, it's hard to escape the onslaught of pumpkin spice everything for the entirety of the fall season. 2. Pumpkin spice products are becoming too obscure. We understand pumpkin spice lattes, but pumpkin spice-flavored vodka? Pumpkin Spice Spam? It's easy to draw the line at a certain point. 3. Pumpkin spice isn't just for food and drink anymore. Who needs regular deodorant when you can have pumpkin spice-scented deodorant? Apparently, there's a demand for pumpkin spice scented car fresheners too. 4. Pumpkin spice is taking over social media. Autumnal decoration pictures and pumpkin patch snaps, are one thing but when your social media is flooded with pumpkin spice-themed posts, it's hard to discern original content from generic clickbait. 5. The pumpkin spice craze is contributing to environmental waste. When every product is being produced with a pumpkin spice flavor, it results in excessive packaging waste. 6. We've stopped valuing the other fall flavors. Apple cinnamon, maple, and cranberry deserve love just as much as pumpkin spice. Our obsession with pumpkin spice has overshadowed the other equally tasty fall flavors. While there's no denying that the pumpkin spice craze brings a certain charm to the fall season, perhaps it's time to indulge in moderation. Let's not forget about the other flavors of autumn and get lost in the sea of pumpkin spice.","Ah, it’s that time of the year… Chilly weather, sweaters, Halloween costumes, pumpkin spice everything and… No, wait, it’s barely September. I’m sitting here at my desk wearing a sundress and sandals. It’s Fall doesn’t officially start for about three more weeks. This pumpkin spice mania has got to stop, people. Especially so early in the year. While we can get behind pumpkin spice lattes (and pumpkin spice ales) every now and again (and are glad to hear Starbucks will actually be using pumpkin in its recipe this year ), pumpkin just doesn’t need to be an ingredient in every item we eat this fall. (We’re glad to hear that that Pumpkin Spice Four Loko was all a hoax.) Here are some products we think go a bit too far: Pumpkin Spice Pop Rocks So a liberal dose of sugar with a sprinkling of nutmeg? (Photo: Mike Mozart , Flickr.) Pumpkin Spice M&Ms While M&Ms are certainly delicious in the natural state (peanut butter, plain and crispy are all fine by us), we’ve been a bit less taken by seasonal M&M flavors, and pumpkin spice is no exception. (Photo: Mike Mozart , Flickr.) Pumpkin Pie Spice Pringles Even Pringles must have realized they’d gone too far… They’re no longer selling their pumpkin spice-flavored potato chips this year. (Photo: Joel Kramer , Flickr.) Pumpkin Spice Jell-O Pudding Why does this exist? Isn’t it just as quick to grab a can of pumpkin filling if you’re planning on making a pie? What would the consistency be like? So many questions. Then again, the reviews we read about it tend to be pretty positive. (Photo: Mike Mozart , Flickr.)

497,"The charming coastal town of Teignmouth is buzzing with excitement as the beloved pied busker, Tommy Marks, leads the way to the annual charity festival. The event, which is set to take place at the picturesque Teignmouth seafront this weekend, promises to be a fantastic occasion to raise funds for a good cause. Tommy Marks, who has been performing in Teignmouth for over two decades, has won the hearts of both locals and visitors with his soulful music and colorful outfits. His distinctive look, which includes a bright red hat and a flurry of patterned fabrics, has earned him the nickname ""the pied busker of Teignmouth."" But Tommy is not just a talented musician; he is also a passionate advocate for local charities, and this year, he has taken on the responsibility of spearheading the charity festival. With his infectious energy and community spirit, Tommy has rallied local businesses and volunteers, bringing together an impressive range of activities and entertainment for all ages. From live music and dance performances to face painting and craft stalls, the festival promises to be a day of fun and laughter for the whole family. Local businesses have generously donated prizes for the raffle, and all proceeds from the event will go towards a variety of Teignmouth charities, including the Teignmouth Lifeboat Station and the Alice Cross Centre. As the town prepares for the festival, residents have expressed their admiration for Tommy's tireless commitment to the community. ""We're all so proud of Tommy,"" said local resident Sarah Brown. ""He's such a generous soul, and we're lucky to have him here in Teignmouth."" With the support of the town behind him, Tommy is confident that the charity festival will be a huge success. ""Teignmouth is a special place, and I just want to give back to the community that has given me so much over the years,"" he said. ""I can't wait to see everyone come together for this fantastic cause.""","Comments (0) TO GEAR up for their first Oxjam Takeover, the Pied Busker of Teignmouth was drumming up support this weekend. The Pied Busker of Teignmouth, with a few other local musicians, walked the streets of Teignmouth entertaining shoppers for charity on Saturday. The procession started outside the Oxfam shop and then walked to significant places to stop and busk ahead of the main Teignmouth Takeover event next month. The group continued to Finley Browns Cafe where they had equipment set up to continue the music and do an intimate gig. Lee Hall, from band Datura, performed a solo set, as well as Tom Hayes and Robert Johnson, from band Alpha Tide. There were bucket shakers outside the door to attract more of an audience and let them know what was going on. Oxjam organiser Georgie Hellier said: ""Our fundraiser, the Pied Busker of Teignmouth, went amazingly well. ""Our musicians were so talented and the busker had a great cheeky personality to really embrace the slightly unconventional event, get fully involved and attract the public's attention. ""All the members of the public who we saw were genuinely intrigued with what we were doing, and so generous when they knew what we were raising money for. We are really happy with the amount we raised for Oxfam. ""Finley Browns Cafe was the perfect little venue to host the second part of our fundraising event. The owners, Martin and Faye, were so accommodating and really keen to get involved and help Oxjam Teignmouth.""

498,"The Taliban in Afghanistan have reportedly seized control of the city centre of Kunduz, a key northern town, according to local officials. The fall of Kunduz marks a major setback for the government of President Ashraf Ghani, and comes as US and Nato forces continue their withdrawal from the country. Taliban fighters attacked Kunduz city in the early hours of Monday morning, with reports suggesting that they quickly overran government buildings and checkpoints. The group have claimed that they now control all government institutions in the city, and that they have freed all prisoners from the local jail. The attack on Kunduz is the most significant operation by the Taliban since they launched a nationwide offensive when foreign forces began withdrawing from the country earlier this year. It also comes just weeks after the Taliban captured more than 100 districts across the country, prompting fears that the group could soon take control of the country. The situation in Kunduz is fluid and it is unclear at this point whether government forces will be able to recapture the city. The Afghan military has said that they are sending reinforcements to the area, while the Taliban have reportedly called on residents to remain calm and stay in their homes. The Taliban's recent gains come as US and Nato forces continue their withdrawal from Afghanistan after almost 20 years of war. The US has said that it will complete its withdrawal by September 11, with Nato forces also set to leave the country by this date. Many fear that the withdrawal of Western military forces will lead to a power vacuum in the country, allowing the Taliban to take control. The group has been fighting an insurgency in Afghanistan since they were toppled from power by a US-led invasion in 2001. Despite taking control of Kunduz, the Taliban have promised not to attack foreign troops as they withdraw from the country. However, experts warn that the group will likely increase their attacks on government and civilian targets in an effort to gain more territory. The situation in Afghanistan is complicated by the ongoing peace talks between the Taliban and the government. The talks, which are being mediated by the US, have been going on for months but have made little progress. The Taliban has demanded that their members be released from prison, and that the group be allowed to become part of the government. The government has so far refused these demands, but some analysts believe that a compromise may be necessary to end the war. The fall of Kunduz is a major blow to the Afghan government, and it is likely that the Taliban will use their gains in the city as leverage in the peace talks. It remains to be seen whether the government will be able to prevent further gains by the Taliban, or whether the group will be able to take control of the country. The situation in Afghanistan is complex, and the future of the country remains uncertain as US and Nato forces withdraw. The Taliban's continued attacks on government and civilian targets, and their recent gains, highlight the need for a negotiated peace settlement to end the country's long-running conflict.","By KUNDUZ CITY, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Taliban fighters battled their way into the centre of Kunduz city in northern Afghanistan on Monday and seized the provincial governor's office, in one of the most serious security breaches in 14 years of war, witnesses and officials said. The insurgents raised the white Taliban banner over the central city square and freed hundreds of fellow militants from the local jail, in a major embarrassment for Afghan forces who abandoned a provincial headquarters for the first time. The stunning assault came a day before President Ashraf Ghani's unity government marked its first anniversary. It was the second time this year that the hardline Islamist movement has besieged Kunduz city, defended by Afghan forces battling largely without NATO's support after it withdrew most of its troops last year. The insurgents launched a surprise, three-pronged offensive before dawn, and by evening they had captured the governor's compound and provincial police headquarters, said Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesman for the hardline Islamist movement. ""Our fighters are now advancing towards the airport,"" Mujahid said on his Twitter account. A senior government official in Kabul confirmed that the provincial headquarters had fallen and Afghan forces were regrouping at the airport. Dozens of Afghan special forces have been flown into Kunduz airport on a C-130 aircraft and were preparing to launch a counter-attack, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""IT LOOKS GRIM"" The Kunduz assault marks a troubling development in the insurgency, although Afghan forces have managed to drive the Taliban back from most of the territory they have gained this year during an escalation in violence. ""It is certainly the first major breach of a provincial capital since 2001,"" said Graeme Smith, senior analyst for International Crisis Group. ""They are choking the Afghan forces from all sides. It looks pretty grim."" The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan evacuated its Kunduz compound on Monday morning, soon after the assault began. ""They've been relocated within Afghanistan,"" said U.N. spokesman Dominic Medley, declining to say where or how many staff were evacuated. Abdullah Danishy, deputy governor of Kunduz, vowed that Afghan forces would retake the occupied city. ""We have reinforcements coming from other areas and will beat back the Taliban,"" Danishy said by telephone from Kunduz airport after fleeing his office. But with much of downtown Kunduz now in Taliban hands and terrified civilians either trying to flee or hiding inside their homes, the insurgents may be tough to dislodge. ""Once they get inside an urban area, your air assets and artillery become much less useful,"" Smith said. FAMILIES SEPARATED The Taliban were ousted in 2001 after a U.S.-led campaign, and have been fighting to reimpose their rule in sporadic clashes ever since. They have stepped up their offensive this year as NATO forces drew down to just a few thousand troops. One Reuters witness saw buildings on fire in the south of the city and Taliban fighters entering a 200-bed government-run hospital. Dozens of panicked residents fled to the city's main airport but were turned away by security forces. Electricity and phone services were cut across most of the city, and family members struggled to locate one another in the chaos. ""My uncle's wife has been killed by the Taliban today and still my wife and kids are in the area that the Taliban captured, so it is important to free my family,"" said Matin Safraz, an official at the interior ministry who was visiting Kunduz for the Muslim holiday of Eid. Safraz had retreated to the airport, and said he was prepared to fight the Taliban with a borrowed AK-47 rifle. Sayed Sarwar Hussaini, a spokesman for Kunduz police, said 20 Taliban fighters had been killed and three Afghan police wounded in the early morning clashes. Updated casualty figures were not immediately available. According to two security officials, Taliban gunmen, some armed with rocket-propelled grenades, overwhelmed security guards and broke into the main city prison, freeing hundreds of fighters. Taliban spokesman Mujahid urged Kunduz residents to stay inside. ""The mujahideen are trying to avoid any harm to Kunduz residents,"" he said on his official Twitter account, referring to Taliban fighters. The once-quiet north of Afghanistan has seen escalating violence in recent years. Kunduz city was the centre of fierce fighting in April as the Taliban sought to gain territory after the end of NATO's combat mission at the end of 2014. A scaled-down NATO presence now mostly trains and advises Afghan forces, although U.S. drones still target militant leaders and a U.S. counter-terrorist force also operates in the country.

500,"In a concerning turn of events, markets took a sharp downturn today as durable goods orders experienced a significant drop. According to data released by the Commerce Department, orders for durable goods fell by 0.6% in August, far below the expected 1.5% increase. This marks the worst drop in durable goods orders since April of this year. The drop in orders was mainly attributed to a decrease in demand for transportation equipment, including cars and planes. Orders for motor vehicles and parts declined by 4%, while orders for commercial aircraft fell by 17.7%. The decline in demand for transportation equipment caused a ripple effect throughout the economy, leading to a decrease in overall order numbers. This news sent shockwaves through the market, with major indices all experiencing significant losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 350 points, or 1.3%, while the S&P 500 dropped by 1.2%. The Nasdaq Composite also saw a significant decrease, falling by 1.1%. The drop in durable goods orders is a concerning sign for the economy as a whole, as it suggests a potential slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending.

502,"Newark's downtown area is set to get a new hotel, as a developer plans to transform a long-vacant office building into a modern and stylish hotel that will cater to the city's growing tourism industry. The developer, known for his successful hotel projects in other major cities, has purchased the building on Broad Street and is now in the process of securing the necessary permits from the city. The yet-to-be-named hotel will feature approximately 150 guest rooms, meeting and conference facilities, a fitness center, a bar and restaurant, and other amenities that are essential for a modern traveler. Mayor Ras Baraka welcomed the news, saying, “This project is a tremendous boost to our efforts to revitalize downtown Newark and add to our range of offerings for visitors and residents alike. We have worked tirelessly to make our city a destination for tourism, and this hotel represents another important step forward in that effort.” The hotel is expected to bring much-needed economic activity to the area, as it will create employment opportunities for hundreds of people and generate significant revenue for local businesses. Moreover, it will contribute to the city's growing reputation as a major cultural and entertainment hub in the region. The project is also seen as a positive development for the broader community, particularly as it will help to bring investment into an area that has been neglected in recent decades. The new hotel is viewed as a catalyst for further development and regeneration in the vicinity, which would benefit residents and businesses alike. Overall, the new hotel project is a welcome addition to the vibrant city of Newark, and is expected to help boost the local economy, create jobs, and promote the city as a major tourist destination in the region. With its wide range of amenities and excellent location, the hotel is poised to become a popular choice for visitors seeking a comfortable and modern stay in the heart of Newark's downtown area.","NEWARK – The city's downtown may soon be home to another new hotel. Hari Newark Urban Renewal LLC has filed plans with the city to convert the former Catholic Charities building at 1136-1166 Raymond Boulevard into a Homewood Suites Hotel by Hilton extended-stay hotel. The Edison-based developer is also seeking a 20-year tax abatement from the city, which the Municipal Council could approve at its regular meeting Wednesday night. The 12-story building across from Military Park is currently vacant. It is bordered by a parking garage to the east, and Commerce Court to the west. PLUS: Newark alters regulations to pave way for potential downtown casino Hilton spokeswoman Tiffany Wilson said she had no information on when the hotel might open or any agreement with Hari Newark Urban Renewal. Public records indicate that the Edison-based development company is owned by Mehendra Patel, who could not be reached for comment. The new hotel would be one of several planned to open around Newark in the coming years, after the city went nearly four decades without a single new one. That streak ended in 2012, when the Courtyard Marriott opened near the Prudential Center arena downtown , and others have followed, including the boutique Hotel Indigo on Broad Street. Last year, officials approved plans for a Carvi Hotel at the intersection of Lafayette and Monroe streets – the first to be built in the city's Ironbound section . Hilton also has plans for a 108-room Home2 Suites hotel on Haynes Avenue in the South Ward, close to the site of a proposed new train station along a new leg of the PATH rail line to Newark Liberty International Airport. Wilson said that hotel is projected to open in December 2017. Dan Ivers may be reached at divers@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter at @DanIversNJ . Find NJ.com on"

504,"Anheuser-Busch, one of the largest brewing companies in the United States, announced that it will acquire a craft brewer, signaling a shift in the company's strategy. The move comes after Anheuser-Busch experienced several years of declining sales due to a saturation of the beer market. The acquisition will allow Anheuser-Busch to expand its portfolio of products beyond its traditional mass-produced beers. The company hopes to appeal to younger consumers who are looking for more unique and flavorful beer options. According to a statement released by Anheuser-Busch, the acquisition will ""create a unique and valuable combination of brands, while also driving innovation in the craft beer space."" While the specific craft brewer that Anheuser-Busch plans to acquire has not yet been announced, industry insiders speculate that it may be one of the larger independent breweries, such as Dogfish Head or Boston Beer Company. Anheuser-Busch has a history of acquiring craft brewers, having previously bought out craft beer companies including Blue Point, Elysian, and Goose Island. The acquisition has been met with criticism by some in the craft beer community, who argue that Anheuser-Busch's ownership of smaller breweries takes away from the independent and artisanal nature of craft beer. It remains to be seen how the acquisition will affect the reputation of the craft brewer and its relationship with its loyal customers. However, Anheuser-Busch has emphasized its commitment to preserving the individuality and unique character of its acquired craft breweries. In the past, Anheuser-Busch has allowed its acquired breweries to continue operating independently, while also providing support and resources to help them grow their businesses. The acquisition is part of Anheuser-Busch's broader strategy to diversify its product offerings and appeal to a wider range of consumers. In recent years, the company has focused on developing new products, such as spiked seltzers and non-alcoholic beers, in response to changing consumer preferences. Anheuser-Busch's acquisition of a craft brewer highlights the growing popularity of craft beer in the United States, which now accounts for over 25% of all beer sales. The craft beer industry has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven in part by consumers' desire for more diverse and flavorful beer options. Overall, Anheuser-Busch's decision to acquire a craft brewer signals a shift towards a more diverse and innovative product portfolio. While the move has been met with skepticism by some in the craft beer community, it remains to be seen how the acquisition will affect the industry as a whole.","Anheuser-Busch InBev NV said Wednesday that it is buying Los Angeles-based brewery Golden Road Brewing, the beer giant's latest effort to tap into the growing demand for craft beers. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed. AB InBev, the world's largest beer company with brands like Budweiser and Bud Light, has made a concerted push over the last several years to catch up with American consumers, who increasingly are trading mild-flavored lagers like Bud Light for more flavorful India Pale Ales and porters made by craft breweries. Golden Road road is the largest craft brewery in Los Angeles. Its beers include Point the Way IPA, Wolf Among Weeds IPA, Golden Road Hefeweizen and a collection of seasonal brews. The company, which sells both canned and draft beers, expects to sell 45,000 barrels of beer this year. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of the year. The deal is AB InBev's fifth craft-brewery acquisition since 2011. AB InBev bought its first craft brewer in 2011, paying $38.8 million for Chicago-based Goose Island. It has also picked up Patchogue, N.Y.-based Blue Point Brewing Co., Bend, Ore.-based 10 Barrel, and Seattle-based Elysian Brewing Co. The Golden Road acquisition will give AB InBev a foothold in the growing Los Angeles craft beer market. Golden Road sold approximately 45,000 barrels of beer in 2015. Recent brewery acquisitions have priced craft brewers at more than $1,000 a barrel. Craft's share of the U.S. beer market has more than doubled over the past decade to 9%, while share for mainstream beers like Budweiser and Miller Lite have fallen to 77% from 86%, according to industry tracker Beer Marketer's Insights. Imported beer makes up the rest of the market. The Golden Road deal is the third craft deal this month. MillerCoors LLC, a joint venture between SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Co., recently announced a deal for San Diego-based Saint Archer. Dutch Brewer Heineken NV said earlier this month it took a 50% stake in Lagunitas Brewing, the sixth-largest independent brewer in the U.S. The deal comes as AB InBev pursues beverage-maker SABMiller PLC, a bold move that, if successful, would create a brewing giant that would dominate much of the global beer market. A deal would allow the new beer behemoth to take big mainstream brands like Budweiser and Stella Artois, which have been languishing in key markets, into new corners of the globe. The deal could also help the two brewers resist the growing popularity of craft beers. SABMiller has said that its board ""will review and respond as appropriate to any proposal which might be made.""

508,"According to a new report, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from landfills in the United States have been significantly underestimated in the past. The findings call into question the accuracy of existing estimates and highlight the need for more accurate measurements and reporting. The report, titled ""Estimating Methane Emissions from Landfills: Peer-Reviewed Analysis,"" was published by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and research firm ICF. It analyzes data from 190 landfills across 40 states and finds that methane emissions were generally much higher than previously thought. Methane, a potent GHG, is generated by the breakdown of organic waste in landfills. It is estimated to be 28 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in terms of its warming potential. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), landfills are responsible for 5% of global methane emissions. However, the new report suggests that the EPA's current estimate of 12% of total US methane emissions from landfills may be too low. The authors estimate that the actual figure could be closer to 20%, indicating a much larger contribution to overall emissions. The report's lead author, Dr. Mark Brownstein of EDF, said in a statement, ""If the methane problem from landfills turns out to be larger than we thought, it would be a blow to overall efforts to curb greenhouse gases."" He added, ""We need to continue to refine our understanding of the methane problem in landfills to make sure that our efforts to reduce emissions are as effective as possible."" The report also highlights the need for more accurate reporting and measurement of methane emissions from landfills. Currently, most landfill operators use a method known as the Landfill Gas Monitoring Protocol (LGMP) to estimate emissions. However, the report finds that this method may not accurately reflect actual emissions and calls for more precise measurement techniques. The authors recommend using the latest technology, such as drone-mounted sensors and remote sensing, to measure emissions more accurately. They also call for better reporting practices, including regular reporting of emissions data and increased transparency around how estimates are calculated. The report comes at a critical time, as the US seeks to reduce its overall GHG emissions and fulfill its commitments under the Paris Agreement. Landfills are just one source of emissions that need to be addressed, but the report suggests that they may be a larger contributor than previously thought. As Dr. Brownstein notes, ""Reducing methane emissions from landfills is not only important for mitigating climate change, but also for improving air quality and protecting public health."" The report's findings should serve as a wake-up call for policymakers and industry leaders to take action to address this significant source of emissions.","Boston News.Net Monday 21st September, 2015 WASHINGTON - Landfill disposal rates in the US at 262 million tonnes a year in 2012 is more than double what has been estimated by the federal Environmental Protection Agency, according to a study by three US environmental scientists. The study report published Monday in Nature Climate Change, states that the volume of waste in landfills, a major source of the potent greenhouse gas methane, was grossly underestimated in the United States in 2012. Landfill disposal of municipal solid waste represents one of the largest anthropogenic global methane emission sources. Recent policy approaches have targeted significant reduction of these emissions to combat climate change in the US. The study found that as against 122 million tons of garbage estimated to have been dumped in 2012 by the EPA, there was around 262 million tons of garbage dumped in landfills that year, the environmental scientists wrote. ""This suggested that methane emissions, from the decomposition of municipal waste at these dumps, was also undercounted,"" the report states. The scientists claimed to have used a different methodology which was the ""most accurate for the US so far"" than the EPA. The efficacy of active gas collection systems in the US was also examined by the scientists by analyzing performance data, including fire occurrence, from more than 850 landfills. The study's primary goal was to learn more about the efficiency of methane capture systems at landfills, which are more effective after a landfill stops accepting new waste, said study co-author Jon T. Powell, a Yale doctoral student. ""When a landfill reaches the end of its life, an engineered cap or barrier system is installed to seal off the waste material from the environment,"" Powell said. ""Open landfills typically have some areas that are 'closed' in this manner, but also have areas that do not have permanent caps, and it is more difficult to extract methane and other gases that are generated in these areas."" The study found that gas collection systems at closed landfills were significantly more efficient and on average 17 percentage points more efficient than those at open landfills, but open landfills were found to represent 91 percent of all landfill methane emissions. ""These results demonstrate the clear need to target open landfills to achieve significant near-term methane emission reductions,"" states the report. Landfills represent the third-largest, man-made source of methane in the United States -- about 18 percent of domestic emissions, according to the report. Methane lives for a shorter time in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), the most abundant greenhouse gas (GHG), but traps far more of the heat radiated from Earth's surface. The scientists calculated that the average rate of landfill waste disposal was increasing at a rate of about 0.3 percent per year. The underestimation of the waste disposal and the emission in the United States has raised the spectre of similar miscalculations in the rest of the world. ""A high reliance on land filling has been observed in the EU (European Union) and in developing nations, similar to the US,"" wrote the researchers. ""Improving the collection of LFG at open landfills, must be a target for policymakers, researchers and practitioners to achieve near-term GHG emission reductions in the waste sector."""
509,"The Department of Human Services (DHS) is facing tough opposition from the Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) ahead of a crucial wage poll. The department has been fighting for the hearts and minds of staff members who are demanding better wages and working conditions. While the department recognizes the staff's demands, they are arguing that the offer on the table is ""better than nothing."" The offer includes a modest wage increase of 1.8% per year, plus additional leave entitlements. The CPSU is not convinced and has launched a counter-campaign to rally support from employees. They argue that DHS staff are overworked and underpaid, with many employees forced to work overtime or take on additional responsibilities without compensation. They are demanding a wage increase of at least 3% per year. The tension between DHS and CPSU has been building in recent months, with several rounds of negotiations failing to result in a satisfactory outcome. Both sides are now gearing up for a decisive vote on the latest proposal. In an effort to sway staff members, DHS has been highlighting the positive aspects of the offer. They point out that the 1.8% wage increase is in line with the current rate of inflation, meaning that staff members' purchasing power will remain stable. They also emphasize that the additional leave entitlements will provide the staff with more time to spend with their families and recharge their batteries. However, the CPSU argues that the offer is not enough to address the root causes of staff dissatisfaction. They argue that the department needs to invest in recruitment and training to alleviate the workload and improve the overall work environment. The vote is expected to be a close call, with staff members torn between accepting a moderate wage increase and rejecting an offer that they feel does not address their concerns. Many employees have voiced their frustration with the current situation, expressing a desire for a resolution that will put an end to the ongoing dispute. In the coming weeks, both DHS and CPSU will be ramping up their campaigns to sway the vote in their favor. The department will be highlighting the benefits of the current proposal, while the union will be advocating for a more substantial wage increase and meaningful changes to working conditions. Regardless of the outcome, one thing is clear – the tension between DHS and CPSU will not be resolved overnight. The ongoing dispute highlights the challenges facing modern workplaces, where employees are demanding fair compensation and better working conditions, while employers are struggling to balance the budget and deliver services.","The APS's largest department is battling to win hearts and minds. With very simple mathematics. More public service newsDHS wage showdown loomsTax Office offers front-loaded pay deal The federal government's largest department, Human Services, is battling to win the hearts and minds of its 34,000 public servants before they begin voting Friday on a new wage offer. Workers at the giant department are being told that 1.5 per cent pay offer is better than a 0.00 per cent pay offer as management hammers its message with a ""get the facts"" poster blitz. Public servants at DHS sites around Australia arrived at work on Thursday to be confronted with ""Vote-Yes"" screensavers on their computers as management pull out all the stops ahead of the poll. Meantime at the Australian Taxation Office, bosses are battling just to get a ballot up and running as unions take their grievances with the process to the industrial umpire. Campaigning at DHS is reaching fever pitch with the department's senior management and their adversaries in the Community and Public Sector Union blitzing Centrelink, Medicare and Child Support Agency workplaces around the nation with their campaign posters. Better than nothing? tell us what you think at ps@canberratimes.com.au Senior management at the department want to see an end to the troubled bargaining process which has been dogging the department since early 2014 but are up against a determined CPSU effort in the most heavily unionised federal department. The boss's message urges public servants to ""get the facts"", arguing their offer of 1.5 per cent over three years is the ""best pay offer around"". ""1.5% is better than 00.0%, that's a fact!"" the poster declares. ""Low pay offer? It's the best pay offer around and that's a fact too!"" In its response, the CPSU is using the image of public service minister Eric Abetz who the union believes is one of its best assets as it works for the large no-vote it needs to maintain the momentum for its campaign against the Abbott government's public sector wage policies. One poster depicts the minister pushing down on rights, conditions, wages and jobs while another highlights the improvements to the offer that have already been made in the face of the wholesale rejection of earlier proposals. Voting begins on Friday and ends on Thursday, September 10. Meantime at the Australian Taxation Office, unions have applied to the Fair Work Commission for ""bargaining orders"" forcing Tax Office bosses to disclose more information before a vote on their wage offer is held. Senior management are keen to hold a ballot of their 18,000 public servants . But the Australian Services Union, backed by the CPSU, says it needs to know more about Commissioner Jordan's plans for productivity improvements and cost savings between this financial year and 2018-2019. But the ATO's human resources boss Geoff Leeper say he wants to go to a ballot as soon as possible. ""We think that is fair and reasonable after more than 12 months of negotiations,"" Mr Leeper told workers on Wednesday. The ATO is seeking a fast-tracked resolution to the dispute from the FWC. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald."
