0,"Members of the Worcester breakfast club for veterans are receiving their morning meals, courtesy of a local community group.   The Redditch Advertiser has learned that the breakfast club, which meets regularly at a community center in Worcester, includes veterans from various branches of service who gather to socialize and share a meal.   The group is supported by a team of volunteers from Worcester Breakfast Club, a non-profit organization that provides veterans with meals and support services. The organization aims to help those who have served by ensuring that they receive proper nutrition and companionship.   “This is really a great program”, says club member and Air Force veteran, Bob Smith. “We veterans really appreciate the support the community is giving us”.   The organization’s volunteers provide breakfast every other Monday, including pancakes, eggs, bacon, and fresh fruit. The meals are delivered to the community center, where the veterans gather to socialize and enjoy each other’s company.   The Worcester Breakfast Club was recently awarded a $5,000 grant from the Veterans Affairs office to assist in their efforts. The grant will provide funding for the purchase of food and supplies, as well as additional resources to support veterans attending the breakfast club.   “We are proud to support veterans in our community”, says John Doe, president of the Worcester Breakfast Club. “Our volunteers are dedicated to providing nutritious meals and companionship to those who have served our country”.   The breakfast club has become a staple in the community, with members not only enjoying breakfast, but also participating in a variety of other activities. The Worcester Breakfast Club has organized bowling tournaments, golf outings, and other events to help veterans connect and share experiences.   “Being a part of this group has really made a difference in my life”, says club member and Army veteran, Sarah Johnson. “Having a place to go each week where I can connect with other veterans has been a lifesaver for me”.   The Worcester breakfast club for veterans is just one example of the important work being done by community groups to support those who have served. The Redditch Advertiser salutes the efforts of the volunteers and members of this group, and encourages our readers to learn more about how they can help support veterans in their own communities.","VETERANS saluted Worcester's first ever breakfast club for ex-soldiers which won over hearts, minds and bellies.    The Worcester Breakfast Club for HM Forces Veterans met at the Postal Order in Foregate Street at 10am on Saturday.    The club is designed to allow veterans a place to meet, socialise, eat and drink, giving hunger and loneliness their marching orders.    Father-of-two Dave Carney, aged 43, of Merrimans Hill, Worcester, set up the club after being inspired by other similar clubs across the country.    He said: ""As you can see from the picture, we had a good response. Five out of the 10 that attended said they saw the article in the newspaper and turned up.    ""We even had an old chap travel from Droitwich and he was late on parade by three hours.    ""It's generated a lot of interest and I estimate (from other veterans who saw the article) that next month's meeting will attract about 20 people. Onwards and upwards.""    He said the management at the pub had been extremely hospitable to them.    Mr Carney said: ""They bent over backwards for us. They really looked after us well. That is the best choice of venue I could have made. They even put 'reserved for the armed forces'.     Promoted stories    The reserve veteran with the Royal Engineers wanted to go to a breakfast club but found the nearest ones were in Bromsgrove and Gloucester so he decided to set up his own, closer to home.    He was influenced by Derek Hardman who set up a breakfast club for veterans in Hull and Andy Wilson who set one up in Newcastle. He said the idea has snowballed and there were now 70 similar clubs across the country and even some in Germany.    Mr Carney said with many Royal British Legion clubs closing he wanted veterans and serving personnel to feel they had somewhere they could go for good grub, beer and banter to recapture the comradery of being in the forces.    The Postal Order was chosen because of its central location and its proximity to the railway station and hotels and reasonably priced food and drink.    The management of the pub have even given the veterans a designated area within the pub.       Share article       The next meeting is at the Postal Order on Saturday, October 3 at 10am.    The breakfast club meets on the first Saturday of each month for those who want to attend in future."

2,"The influence of our words on both ourselves and others cannot be overstated. Every word we speak or write has the power to inspire, motivate, educate or even hurt and destroy. It is therefore imperative that we choose our words wisely, as they have the ability to shape our thoughts, emotions and actions.  As societal beings, communication comes naturally to us, and it is through our words that we express ourselves and interact with others. Words can build bridges and foster relationships, or they can create division and animosity. The impact of our words depends on how we use them and the intention behind them.  One of the most significant ways in which our words influence us is how they shape our self-talk, which is the internal dialogue we have with ourselves. Our self-talk has immense power over our self-esteem, self-confidence, and mood. If we engage in negative self-talk by using words such as ""I'm not good enough,"" ""I'm a failure,"" or ""I'll never be successful,"" we are likely to feel downbeat and unworthy. Conversely, if we use positive self-talk by affirming ourselves with words such as ""I am capable,"" ""I am strong,"" or ""I can do this,"" we are likely to feel empowered and optimistic.  Likewise, the influence of our words extends to how we communicate with others in our personal and professional relationships. Our words can either build trust or undermine it, establish respect or diminish it, and foster empathy or hinder it. We all have experienced situations where a poorly chosen word has caused misunderstandings, hurt feelings, or even broken relationships. On the other hand, we also have experienced the power of a well-chosen word to connect with others, convey empathy, and build rapport.  As writers, journalists, and media practitioners, we have an enormous responsibility to use our words ethically and responsibly. The words we use can shape public opinions, influence beliefs, and even affect public policies. Words have the power to inform or misinform, educate or deceive, and inspire or manipulate. We must, therefore, strive for accuracy, fairness, and objectivity in our reporting and writing to avoid the harm that can come from irresponsible journalism.  Furthermore, our use of language can also reflect our attitudes and values towards certain groups of people. The words we use can either promote inclusivity and diversity or perpetuate discrimination and prejudice. For instance, using racially charged language or derogatory terms to describe marginalized groups can contribute to social and cultural inequalities. Therefore, we must be mindful of our language use and seek to promote inclusive and respectful communication in our writing and speech.  In conclusion, the influence of our words cannot be underestimated, both on ourselves and others. Our words can either build or destroy, inspire or hurt, inform or deceive. It is essential to understand the power of our words and use them responsibly in our personal and professional interactions. As media practitioners, we have a duty to uphold ethical and responsible journalism by seeking accuracy, fairness, and objectivity in our reporting and writing. Our use of language can reflect our attitudes towards diversity and inclusivity or perpetuate discrimination and prejudice. Therefore, let us choose our words wisely and use them to promote positivity, empathy, and respect.","Words kill or give life; they are usually either poison or good fruit. The words we speak are electromagnetic forces that usually reflect our inner attitude.     They contain the power of death and life and ultimately influence the world around us. Augustus Woodbury once said, “Scientific men tell us that every sound upon the surface of our own and other planets circulates in endless and ceaseless waves through infinite space. Certainly not less subtle is the influence of our words upon the life and character of the world.” We must always think about the influence of our words before we say them out; “what is my objective in saying this.” “Are these words going to produce life or death.” Proverbs 18:21 declares, “Death and life are in the power of the tongue and those who love it will eat its fruit.”     As a matter of fact, words are our input in someone else’s life. We must make sure our input gives life and not death. We are actually responsible for the impact we have on others and our communities in general.    As responsible citizens, we must intensify our awareness of the input we have on other people’s lives. Actually, one person can change the course of another person’s life with the power of words. Individual dreams and visions have been aborted because of words of death spoken over them. Homes and marriages have been destroyed because of poisonous words. Companies and businesses have fallen because of words of envy and jealousy. People have lost their jobs because of lying words said about them. We should always be conscious of the life-changing power of our words.     Proverbs 19:1 says, “Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity than one who is crooked in speech and is a fool.” We must use wisdom when we speak, by checking our motives, attitudes and choice of words. We must divorce negative patterns of thinking and bring life to others with our words. Words are influencers. One of the best ways we can use words to influence others, is to practice telling the truth.    We are living in the world where too often people try to influence others with manipulation, false flattery and deception and spin doctoring. The truth creates trust, which in turn generates influence. The other way we can put our words to good use, is to choose to use words that build in our speech, rather than words that tear down people and society.     We should use our words to build other people up, to inspire, encourage and empower, to affirm and bless. Positive words yield positive influence. It is wisdom to refuse to speak words that belittle and demoralise other people around us. When we make a choice of speaking well of others, in-spite of their short comings, then we will have a healthy and far reaching positive influence with our words.    If we spread malicious gossip, we are poisoning our own future and sabotaging our own influence with others. King Solomon of ancient Israel said, “When a leader listens to malicious gossip, all the workers get infested with evil” (Proverbs 29:12, the message Bible). We must use the influence of our words to bring peace in conflicting situations.     Due to the fact that many people have no understanding of the power of their words, they have caused themselves and others unnecessary pain and hardships. Each and every day our actions and our words impact those around us.    The question is, how are we influencing others with our words and actions? One of the best ways we can influence each other is by inspiring, motivating and encouraging each other by what we say. The story is told about how Sugar Ray Robinson changed the course of one girl’s life, Flo-Jo.    When narrating her life story Flo-Jo said, “Sugar Ray looked at me in the eye and told me, it doesn’t matter where you come from, what the colour of your skin is, or what odds are against you. All that matters is that you have a dream and you commit yourself to that dream. Do that and it will happen.” She continued and said, “Right then and there, I was sold out. I was just eight years old but I was fired up about what my future could be.”     With words, Sugar Ray Robinson, one of the outstanding boxing champs inspired a great change in one girls’ life. Words are powerful, they can inspire those around us to greatness. They can bring hope to the hopeless, courage to the discouraged, comfort and healing to the oppressed. We must speak life to our husbands, wives, children, fathers, mothers, our communities and nation.    Paul’s wise advice to the Ephesians is appropriate at this juncture, “Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers.” (Ephesians 4:29). By our words we can build the nation and by our words we can destroy the nation."
