The good news is that their injury report is a rather short one since they were able to stay relatively healthy during the preseason. Unfortunately, there is bad news and it's that they may be without a key defensive starter for quite some time.\n\nLinebacker DeAndre Levy\u00a0is dealing with a hip injury that could honestly end up being a lot worse than anyone first thought. While the team has been rather hush-hush on the severity of it so far, it appears to be quite serious. It may end up requiring surgery, which could keep him out for a pretty good length of time.\n\nThe Lions are hoping to hold off as long as possible on surgery for Levy, and still listed him as doubtful for the game with the Chargers and not as out. Detroit can't place him on short-term injured reserve because they've already used it on rookie cornerback Alex Carter, so they will have to eat Levy's roster spot no matter what happens or place him on season ending injured reserve.\n\nJosh Bynes is expected to start in Levy's place at weakside linebacker for the Lions.\n\nOffensive guard Larry Warford (ankle) is listed as out as well, and he hasn't even practiced in weeks. Warford ended up missing the final two preseason games and is now gone for the opener. It's not 100 percent certain who will start at right guard as it could be rookie first-round pick Laken Tomlinson or possibly LaAdrian Waddle.\n\nThe Lions ended up having to keep an extra defensive tackle (Jermelle Cudko) on their final roster due to Caraun Reid's ankle injury, which has kept him out of practice and preseason games for weeks. He will be out against the Chargers and could miss next week, as well.\n\nWaddle has dealt with an elbow injury this past week, but he will be ready to go.\n\nTight end Eric Ebron (ankle) and running back Tahir Whitehead (elbow) are going to play as needed for the Lions.\n\nThe San Diego Chargers have a strong test against the Detroit Lions in the season opener. The Lions are rather healthy and have enough depth to make up for the absences, but the loss of DeAndre Levy could really hurt if it goes on for too long.\n\nProbable:\nEric Ebron, TE (ankle)\nTahir Whitehead, RB (elbow)\n\nQuestionable:\nLaAdrian Waddle T (elbow)\n\nDoubtful:\nDeAndre Levy, LB (hip)\n\nOut:\nLarry Warford, G (ankle)\nCaraun Reid, DT (ankle)\n\n\n\nDanny Cox knows a little something about the NFL, whether it means letting you know what penalty will come from the flag just thrown on the field or quickly spouting off who the Chicago Bears drafted in the first round of the 1987 draft (Jim Harbaugh).

He's a great man with a warm heart, and generosity, and I'm very proud of him.\" \n \nShe said she was \"very shocked\" by what had happened and added: \"I'm glad that no one's hurt and everything is going to be fine.\" \n \nAsked if he is always so cool and calm, she said: \"Yes, most of the time, and he's loved by everyone, we are very proud of him.\" \n \nShe did not have to worry if he had been involved in the incident, because he rang her to tell her about it, then she watched the news. \n \nShe confirmed he is about to retire, adding: \"Unfortunately what happened, we couldn't have predicted.\" \n \nHis ex-wife Marnie, who is a former cabin crew member and with whom he has a daughter, expressed her relief that he and the rest of the crew got out safely. \n \n\"He is safe and happy,\" she told the Guardian. \"I've had some messages from him. He did a bloody good job.\" \n \nFire officials said at least 14 people were taken to hospital with minor injuries, mostly caused by sliding down the inflatable chutes to escape. \n \nThe airport released a statement which said it was first alerted to the emergency at 4.13pm local time (12.13am BST) and within five minutes everyone was off the plane and the blaze was extinguished. \n   Promoted stories   \nAn audio recording which appears to be the conversation between the captain and air traffic control shows how efficiently the emergency was dealt with. \n \nSpeaking calmly and clearly, th e pilot said: \"Mayday, mayday, Speedbird 2276 request fire services.\" \n \nThe woman in the control tower immediately replied: \"Heavy fire services on the way.\" \n \nForty seconds later the captain added: \"We are evacuating on the runway. We have a fire. I repeat, we are evacuating.\" \n \nAccording to reports the captain was applauded by passengers when he spoke to them in the safety of the terminal building. \n \nBA would not confirm the identity of the captain but said he was \" very experienced and has flown with British Airways for 42 years\". \n \nA spokeswoman for the airport said the passengers were evacuated \"quickly and safely\". \n \nShe went on: \" We cannot express enough gratitude to the emergency response crews, as well as the British Airways crew.\" \n \nThe BA flight from Las Vegas was set to depart for the 10-hour flight to Gatwick when the crew noticed the fire. \n \nBA issued a statement which said the plane \"experienced a technical issue\" and the crew \"evacuated the aircraft safely\". \n \nThe airline added it had provided hotel accommodation and was organising alternative flights for its 157 customers, while those who had been taken to hospital had since been discharged.. \n \nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in the US  said four investigators had been sent to examine the aircraft, including engine, systems and fire specialists. \n \nBA would not reveal how many Britons were on the plane, although the  Las Vegas to Gatwick route is popular with UK leisure travellers. \n \nJacob Steinberg, a Guardian sports reporter who was on the flight, said the captain told passengers there had been a \"catastrophic\" engine failure. \n \nHe tweeted: \" Was asleep as the plane took off. Came to a crashing halt. Smell of smoke. Initially told to stay seated, then shout of evacuate. \n \n\"Could smell and see smoke but was on other side of plane. One person said fire melted a couple of windows. \n \n\"They opened the back door and slide went down and smoke started coming in plane, followed by mad dash to front. A lot of panic.\" \n   \n Share article  \n   \nBoeing said in a statement that it was \"prepared to provide technical assistance to the NTSB following today's incident\". \n \nMcCarran is a major airport in the US, handling almost 43 million passengers a year.","title":"'Hero' British Airways captain hailed after engine fire on Las Vegas runway","media-type":"News","source":"Surrey Comet","published":"2015-09-09T23:26:53Z"}

Ambassador Vitaly Churkin speaks during a U.N. Security Council meeting on the Ukraine crisis, March 15, 2014, at United Nations headquarters in New York. Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Email to a Friend Ukraine intends to pursue its campaign to strip Russia of its U.N. Security Council veto power at the United Nations General Assembly annual meeting and debate later this month. Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, voted unanimously Wednesday in favor of an international initiative to preventing use of the veto to block Security Council resolutions or action in cases where \"conflicts become especially rigid.\" Ukrainian officials said they envision phasing in gradually any restrictions on the use of the veto in the Security Council, and eventually abolish entirely the power of a single state to block votes. Ukraine's U.N. ambassador, Yuriy Sergeyev, tweeted Tuesday that 67 of the General Assembly's 193 members have indicated they support such a move. Russia has dismissed the Ukrainian proposal. Although Ukraine's proposal to reform Council procedures would apply to all five permanent members, it is aimed specifically at Russia, which used its veto six months ago to block a Security Council resolution supporting Ukraine's claim that Moscow is guilty of \"military aggression\" against Ukraine. Kyiv condemns Russia's active support for separatists fighting to break away from Ukraine and for its annexation of Crimea, which had been part of Ukraine. Moscow claims the turmoil in Ukraine since early 2014 is a \"civil war\" in which it has played no role. In late July Moscow wielded its veto power to block a U.N. Security Council resolution to create an international tribunal that would bring to account those responsible for the shootdown in July of 2014 of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine. Investigators implicate Russia in the downing, which killed 298 people. Moscow puts the blame on Ukraine, saying the incident took place in its airspace. The United States, Britain and France, which also have veto power on the Security Council, have criticized previous blocking votes by Russia and by China, especially those that have prevented the Council from imposing sanctions on the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad. The Western powers have supported Ukraine's claims against Russia, but they have avoided taking a position on Kyiv's proposal to abolish the veto. Russia's U.N. envoy, Vitaly Churkin, was quoted Wednesday as saying the permanent Council members' veto right \"is a very important mechanism,\" one that can result in compromise settlements in disputes where member states are bitterly divided. The U.N. Security Council has five permanent members - the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China - with veto powers, and a single permanent member can block any Council action, even if it is backed by all other members. Ten U.N. member states hold temporary, rotating seats on the Council. Temporary members participate in consultations and meetings, and they do vote on Council statements and resolutions, but they cannot block measures that are supported by a majority of the 15 members. Ukraine hopes to be elected to serve as a temporary Council member when membership changes are decided in New York on October 15.

Eat Bulaga!: When is Enough, Enough?\r\u2014 September 22, 2015\rIt\u2019s amusing how #AlDub and #ItsShowtimePastillas are generating millions and millions of tweets in the micro-blogging site, Twitter. But, it\u2019s also kind of frustrating and disturbing how things are turning out in this so-called noontime wars. I may be fascinated by #AlDub, but I am an avid Showtimer. However, It\u2019s Showtime gets borderline desperate to decide on venturing in yet another copy-cat move, also known as the\u00a0Pastillas serye. In a long list, which I have shared, I showed you the times when It\u2019s Showtime tried to parallel\u00a0Eat Bulaga!\u2018s several segments and contests. Although they clicked, this pestering step done by It\u2019s Showtime is obviously a no-brainer, close-to (if not) pathetic take on their share of TV ratings. Yes, they may have, at some point, overpowered the ratings and the noontime slot against EB, but will that ever give them the right and passage to copy and use the other show\u2019s intellectual efforts as their own and eventually, bad mouth the people questioning this deed of theirs? It\u2019s Showtime Mania: Pastillas for Sale #AlDub took fame and the audiences\u2019 lives by storm\u2013all because of a simple, candid accident. EB automatically gained back the noontime clamor because everybody was suddenly in thirst of Yaya Dub and Alden\u2019s dubsmash stints, their notes exchange, the ups-and-downs of their\u00a0\u2018sa tamang panahon\u2019 love story\u2013all of which seamlessly got to be everyone\u2019s lunch time habit. Imagine a daily Pacquiao-fight-like jam-packed TV viewing at home, public terminals, hospitals, schools, and wherever there\u2019s a TV and everybody could watch. EB\u2019s skyrocketing ratings brought by AlDub was obviously a downtime for It\u2019s Showtime. Thus, the push for them to make use of the other YouTube and online media sensations like the infamous Pastillas Girl. I really have nothing against these people wanting to be famous and make a living through TV exposures, but what I am not really in favor of was how It\u2019s Showtime pimping out this Ms. Pastillas on national television while expecting us to empathize, because she was heartbroken, betrayed, back-stabbed, betrayed by her boyfriend and best friend. Yeah, sure, her story is everybody\u2019s story. Yes, probably that empathy soothed other healing hearts and made way for Toper, Jess, and Evan (her tele-suitors) to travel all the way from wherever they\u2019ve been and profess their love (yes, love\u00a0agad-agad) to Ms. Pastillas. And as I have imagined right from the start, the exes of these\u00a0kiligserye\/Twitterserye would come into place, expose themselves on TV, and add on the story of Ms. Pastillas\u2019 life. But was it really needed, that in order to recover from a losing fight against AlDub mania, It\u2019s Showtime would resort to pimping, selling out Ms. Pastillas and her vulnerability on TV? Was it even politically and morally upright? Yes, they may not be boldly and on-the-spot selling this girl in exchange for sexual delights, but isn\u2019t calling on for male prospects out there to be her Mr. Pastillas a close relation to that? My opinion on this matter is far beyond the mere AlDub-Pastillas wars on who is better or who should be idolized more. I\u2019m only saying that while It\u2019s Showtime may give \u2018chances\u2019 or \u2018opportunities\u2019 to these people, they might be taking the route of a wrong direction. I am with Vice Ganda\u2019s statements on people taking all these stardom against Ms. Pastillas and that she shouldn\u2019t be bullied just for the plain fact that she wanted to share her life story on TV; but, I am typically against Vice Ganda\u2019s pertinacity on claiming that they weren\u2019t doing any wrong, that there weren\u2019t anyone being at a disadvantage in all this, because in reality there is, there are. It\u2019s a shame and insult for women to be auctioned for everyone to see. What would the younger generation say and think about this\u2013that it\u2019s perfectly okay to sell out themselves to people? How about the feelings and right-to-intellectual-property of the people behind every segment or production that was closely duplicated, of the real author of the \u2018pastillas recipe\u2019 who was overseen because fame and limelight was cast upon the girl who used (without permission) the recipe that wasn\u2019t her? Definitely, there is something wrong in this current Pastillas fame. And when there\u2019s someone ill-favored in anything, it should be enough. If you cannot see this, then maybe you should pay a visit to the eye-doctor (or better yet to a mental doctor). \u00a0 **photo credits to the owners** Share this Post:\r\u00ab\u00a0Previous Article\rSecond Rate Copycat: War of the Noontime Shows","title":"It\u2019s Showtime VS.

Its\r\nposition at the end of the busy triathlon calendar and the final  stop on\r\nthe Castle Triathlon Series means that there is a party-like festival\r\natmosphere as triathletes sign off their season with PB's, new distances\r\nachieved or sporting success shared with their friends of families. The\r\natmosphere is boosted by 500 camping through the weekend and lots of\r\nentertainment including bands, climbing walls, archery, trade stands, fun\r\nfair  and pleasure rides. \n \nThe event attracts some of the best triathletes in  Britain who are set\r\nto race hard and fast for their share of the trophies and  prize money. Up\r\nfor grabs this year is a prize fund of \u00a38,000 that stands at\r\n\u00a32,000  for the Standard Distance race, whilst those triumphing in the\r\ntoughest  challenge of the day, the half-iron Gauntlet race, will also take\r\nhome their  share of \u00a32,000. Further prizes are given for Series\r\nwinners. \n Favourites  for The Gauntlet 2015 titles  \nThe Gauntlet at Hever Castle is the biggest test in  the Castle Triathlon\r\nSeries. The half-iron distance triathlon takes competitors  into the rolling\r\nhills of the Kent Weald and through an \u2018area of outstanding  beauty'.\r\nTriathletes who took on the 1.9km swim, 90km bike and 21km run last  year\r\nunequivocally reviewed it as one of the \u2018must-do' events in the UK and\r\nattracted  to the challenge, the field has grown once again this year from\r\n200 in 2013 to  now over 850 \u2013 making it one of the most popular in\r\nthe country. \n \nSpearheading the men's field will be the intriguing  re-match between\r\nDarren Jenkins (Bastion 2015 champion) and Karl Alexander  (Hever Castle\r\nGauntlet 2013 champion). These two had an awesome battle at Hever  Castle\r\nearlier this year over the iron-distance Bastion Triathlon in July, with\r\nJenkins emerging on top with his fearsome run proving the decisive factor.\r\nNow set  to battle it out again over the middle distance, will Jenkins once\r\nagain have  the upper hand, or will the shorter distance suit Alexander who\r\nwill have less  run course to cover before the finish line comes? These\r\nquestions and more will  all be answered over the race. \n \nJenkins and Alexander won't have it all their own  way as there is talent\r\nthroughout the field, not least in the form of XTERRA  professional Matt\r\nDewis, Irish Middle Distance champion Kevin Thornton and  talented racer\r\nWill Cowan \u2013 who can all challenge for the podium and have the  class\r\nto win. \n \nBritish and Scottish Middle Distance Champion Nikki  Bartlett is in the\r\nfield and is the clear favourite for the women's title at  Hever Castle\r\nGauntlet Triathlon. \n \nAlso in the field is Pete Dyson, Andy Dyson, Max  Hazell, Ben Matthews,\r\nColin Norris, Ben Pritchard and Neil Tandy. The women's  race will feature\r\nBex Milnes and Kim Morrison. \n Olympic  distance speedsters  \nWhilst the Gauntlet represents a test of speed over  distance at Hever\r\nCastle Triathlon, the speed kings and queens will take on the  Olympic\r\ndistance triathlon, which comprises of the shorter (but no less  testing),\r\ndistances of 1.5km swim, 40km bike and 10km run. Competing for these  titles\r\nwill be elite athletes including Liam Lloyd, Phil Edgley, James Fearn,\r\nCalum Johnson, William Kirk and Scott Thompson. \n \nThe women's race looks particularly exciting, with Catherine  Jameson\r\nheadlining the field. Jameson is a fearsome competitor on the Castle\r\nTriathlon Series circuit and has picked up wins at Chateau du Chantilly,\r\nCastle  Howard and Cholmondeley already this year. Jameson is such a fan of\r\nthe Hever  Castle Triathlon that she has published her top ten reasons to do\r\nthe race HERE . \n \nHever Castle would complete the set. However, a  challenge will come from\r\nanother former Hever Castle Champion, Vicky Johnston  and also from the\r\nreigning European Aquathlon Champion Hannah Kitchen. \n Hever Castle  \u2013 the \u2018must-do British\r\nrace'  \nIn just six years the Hever Castle Triathlon has  swiftly established\r\nitself as an essential destination for British and  international\r\ntriathletes, garnering plaudits and mainstream media attention  for its\r\npicture postcard venue, elite action, age-group choice and festival\r\natmosphere.  There are no fewer than 14  race choices on offer making it one\r\nof the biggest events in the UK. \n \nTo cement the race's title as the world's largest  children's triathlon,\r\nover 1,600 junior athletes are expected to take part. \n \nThe races will begin with an amended and unique  open-water swim in the\r\nspectacular 38 acre Hever Castle Lake and River Eden.  This creates an\r\nincredible spectacle that is  rewarding for both the athletes and the\r\nspectators who can see one of the most  exciting parts of the race up-close.\r\nCompetitors in The Gauntlet will take on a  single 1.9km lap whilst those\r\nracing in the Olympic distance will take on (for  the first time), a single\r\n1.5km lap. \n \n\n \nThose taking part will then transition onto the  undulating cycle that\r\ntakes athletes around a 20km circuit through the High  Weald of Kent, an\r\nArea of Outstanding Natural Beauty, with one lap for the  Sprint and two\r\nlaps for the Olympic-distance racers. Those on The Gauntlet will  be on a\r\nspecially designed two-lap course. The largely off-road run  circumnavigates\r\nthe estate and award-winning castle grounds before making the  dash to the\r\ntree-lined finishing chute beside the lake. \n  Fun for  spectators too  \nThis year there is even more planned for friends,  family and all the\r\nsupporters at the Hever Castle Triathlon Triathlon, with a  variety of live\r\nmusic, family games and of course a brilliant atmosphere for  all.

{"id":"6e264b2b-486e-400b-add3-bd13cfe3b8cc","content":"Whether they're crashing into the bleachers or simply hovering above stadiums to get a cool picture of the action down below, drones have become semi-regular guests at the ballparks these days. \n\nThat has put the federal government, local police forces and security think tanks on alert, trying to catch up to the technology and figure out how to prevent the hard-to-stop devices from doing major damage. \n\n\"It's scary for all of us,\" said Lou Marciani, the director of the National Center for Spectator Sports Safety and Security. \"A crash, even without a payload, has the potential to injure several people. And if they carry a payload, it could be anything from a weapon to anthrax to something worse than that.\" \n\nDrone crashes, two days apart, at the U.S. Open in New York and before a Kentucky football game, made news earlier this month. But over the past two years, more than 50 unmanned aircrafts have flown over Major League Baseball and NFL stadiums, coming and going quietly \u2014 usually controlled by a hobbyist who either lost control of the device or wanted a picture of their favorite team in action. \n\nNo harm done. But the prospect of the drones doing something worse has security experts looking for answers, and quickly. \n\nLast October, the Federal Aviation Administration issued notice that it's illegal to fly drones near Major League Baseball, NFL and NCAA Division I college football games and major auto races. Other sporting events can put their own bans in place. But the penalties for violating a ban \u2014 and who hands out those sentences \u2014 is still murky. \n\nIn the Kentucky case, campus police brought wanton endangerment charges against the owner of the wayward drone; at the U.S. Open, New York police brought similar charges against a high school science teacher who lost control of his drone. \n\nThe FAA issued a \"law enforcement guidance\" paper to help local jurisdictions figure out this new problem. It lists its own enforcement tools \u2014 including warning notices, letters of correction and civil penalties \u2014 but suggests state and local police do most of the work to detect the drones and enforce the penalties. \n\nIn its notice about temporary flight restrictions at sporting events, the FAA lists reckless endangerment, operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence, trespassing and assault as possible criminal charges for unsanctioned drone use. \n\nMuch of this, experts say, is the result of seat-of-the-pants law- and rule-making to combat a new and very fluid problem. And none of it addresses the most important issue: How to prevent a drone from coming into a stadium in the first place. \n\n\"So much of this is unknown and so much of it raises so many questions,\" said Derek Catsam of University of Texas of the Permian Basin, who studies stadium security issue. \"It's a case of where the technology is so far ahead of our ability to come to grips with it.\" \n\nThere are around 2,500 Major League Baseball games a year, so 31 drone sightings last year and nine so far this season does not constitute a major crisis, said John Skinner, the director of security for MLB. Still, baseball took part in a government project called \"Operation Foul Ball\" last year at the All-Star Game in Minneapolis to try to detect drones. \n\nSkinner said Minneapolis police worked with the Department of Homeland Security on a system that could identify the radio frequencies of drones before they took off. \n\n\"In essence, it worked,\" he said. \n\nBut it didn't necessarily protect against the drones taking off; one found its way to the stadium during the home run derby. Also, there are private companies that can provide the same service using similar technology, and some of the teams have been approached about working with those companies. \n\nAmong the dozens of uses for drones at sports facilities is attaching cameras to get before-impossible angles for the TV broadcasts. In January, ESPN cleared numerous regulatory hurdles so it could have drones with cameras follow skiers and snowboarders down the hill for the Winter X Games. \n\nESPN got approval only by ensuring it would not fly the drones over spectators or in the air space of planes flying in and out of a nearby airport. \n\nChris Calcinari, who spearheaded the approvals process for ESPN, called it a big opportunity because \"I don't think there are many events that would actually allow us to fly a drone.\" \n\nAnother application: For security. It's possible that drones themselves could be used to keep renegade drones away from fans. And a drone can hover over a stadium to look for weapons, fights and other disruptions. \n\nThe idea of \"good\" drones and \"bad\" drones flying over the same stadium may seem like stuff of the future. But it's an idea that's not too farfetched. \n\n\"We're in that infant stage of, what does this all mean and where is it going?\" Marciani said. \"It's too early to know. You're crawling. You're not even standing up yet.\"","title":"Drones at stadiums are easy to spot, but hard to stop","media-type":"News","source":"Belleville News Democrat","published":"2015-09-17T07:22:08Z"}

The company then analyzes the data and creates a system of predictive analytics to help universities figure out who might be at risk of dropping out.\n\nIt also builds applications on top of its data platform that can help students pick majors, and analyzes for university administrators the effectiveness of courses.\n\nCivitas generates revenue by selling software subscriptions. About 850 campuses use its services, including the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Arizona, according to its website.\n\nAdarsh Sarma, managing director at Warburg Pincus, in a statement said Civitas was \"a pioneer in the field of using applied data analytics to improve student outcomes.\"\n\nAs state- and federal-funded universities face performance-based funding requirements in which graduation rates are increasingly tied to their budgets, companies like Civitas can be brought in to seek improved results.\n\n\"With this investment, we are going to be able to improve and accelerate both learning and student outcomes for our partner institutions,\" said Thornburgh, Civitas' chief executive.\n\nThe company will use the money for research and development as well as potential mergers and acquisitions.\n\nBesides Warburg Pincus, the fundraising round includes previous investors including Emergence Capital Partners, Austin Ventures, Rethink Education, SJF Ventures and Gera Venture Capital.\n\nWarburg has a history of making money from investments in education technology.

{"id":"db8897f8-5915-473c-98d3-c890071c9501","content":"Moscow State University by Nickolas Titkov on flickr.com \n \nRumor has it that after the Russian Army aided in the defeat of the Nazi\u2019s, Joseph Stalin believed that the world would wish to visit Moscow. During this brief period, Moscow did not have any skyscrapers like you\u2019d see in New York, Chicago, or any place else. Call it the male ego, keeping up with the Joneses, or whatever you\u2019d like, Stalin wanted to display Russian architecture to the world and so he decided to do it in grand fashion. What followed was the construction of seven very distinct buildings that anybody whose ever been to Moscow would remember. The styles chosen were Gothic and Russian Baroque and they were built using similar technology used to build American skyscrapers. Not long afterward, the \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438 ( Stalinist skyscrapers) were born. Those not native to Moscow have deemed them to be the \u201cSeven Sisters.\u201d Whatever you wish to call them, they are beautiful buildings and among the tallest in Europe. \n \nIf you haven\u2019t heard about the Seven Sisters before, watch this short video: \n \nClick here to view the embedded video. \n \nAfter the war had depleted much of Russia\u2019s resources, priorities were shifted toward the important areas. I am not speaking of rebuilding the damaged infrastructure and housing, but rather, creating large, fancy skyscrapers. I am sure that somewhere in Stalin\u2019s mind, this was a good idea and if you\u2019ve ever visited any of these buildings, you might agree. \n \nTwo of these buildings were government buildings, two were hotels, two were apartment buildings and one part of Moscow University. These large and intimidating buildings are located in a circular pattern around the center of Moscow \u2013 arrayed like a fortress. The Russian engineering teams tasked with designing these buildings won the prestigious Stalin Prize for 1948. These designs included over-engineered steel frames, concrete roofs, and masonry infills. The concrete slab foundation of the building at Moscow University is seven meters thick. The ornate architecture certainly makes these beautiful buildings pleasing on the eyes. I have stayed in the Hotel Ukraina and it is quite nice on the inside as well. \n \nIt was reported that the cost to build the Moscow University building was nearly equal to that of the rebuilding of the utterly destroyed Stalingrad \u2013 this rebuilding was, of course, set to take place over the span of five years. For those that have studied Russia during the \u201cStalin\u201d years, most projects were aimed at being completed in five year increments. This project begun under Stalin and ended under Nikita Khrushchev. \n \nMoscow State University\u2019s building is built right next to Sparrow Hills and was the the tallest building in Europe until 1990. Built in part by Gulag inmates, the immense structure stands at 240 meters tall. It is still the tallest educational building in the world with 36 floors. \n \nThe Hotel Ukraina makes up the second building and is currently called the Radisson Royal Hotel. Having stayed a few nights there, I can attest to its beautiful architecture, inside and out, as well as its charm; however, it has gone through remodeling since then. This was the tallest hotel in the world (206 meters tall and 34 floors) until 1975 when a larger one was built in Atlanta, Georgia. It has been said that approximately 9,000 people were used in the building of this magnificent hotel \u2013 seems like it would have been good for the economy. \n \nHotel Leningradskaya , like Hotel Ukraina, has undergone a makeover to restore it to its original brilliance complete with gates very similar to those of the Verkhospassky Cathedral in the Kremlin. Though it is quite a bit smaller than Hotel Ukraina, 136 meters tall, it still packs the luxury and beauty. Both of these hotels are currently owned by Radisson and Hilton. \n \nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs building contains the offices for Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the Russian Federation. The Kotelnicheskaya Embankment Building is an apartment building, initially intended for the elites, bearing resemblance to the Hotel Metropol. The Kudrinskaya Square Building was intended to house Soviet cultural leaders. The Red Gates Administrative Building was designed by Alexey Dushkin; he also designed some of the Moscow Metro and this building is connected to it. \n \nI hope this brief highlight of the Seven Sisters will inspire you to learn more. Being that they contain two of Moscow\u2019s most profound hotels, perhaps you\u2019ll consider staying in one while visiting. Should any of you have any stories of visiting these buildings, please feel free to share them!","title":"Moscow\u2019s Seven Sisters","media-type":"Blog","source":"Russian Language Blog","published":"2015-09-02T06:00:39Z"}

All defendants have denied many of the allegations outlined in the lawsuit.\n\nIn August 2015, a new witness came forward alleging that Hipps had been ordered to walk along a narrow bridge railing as part of a hazing ritual before falling to his death.\n\nSolicitor Chrissy Adams later released a statement calling the witness\u2019 credibility into question and said the case was still at a halt.\n\nThe Hipps\u2019 family\u2019s attorney also released a statement saying the family was disappointed by the solicitor\u2019s public remarks about the witness\u2019 information and again asked anyone who knew what may have happened to Hipps to come forward.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sheriff Crenshaw released the following statement about the case.\n\nThe Oconee County Sheriff\u2019s Office has received numerous media inquiries concerning the one year anniversary of the death of Tucker Hipps.

As chances of gaining admission to top institutes declines, students end up devoting years of study and preparation without realistic expectation of success. However, there are other options for students out there! If you want to be judged holistically, if you are a smart individual but bad test-taker, or if you are simply hankering for global exposure, applying abroad is your best route forward. \n \nApplying to top institutes overseas requires a combination of factors. The first are the exams\u2014you may take either GRE\/ GMAT as most colleges accept these tests. These tests are less comprehensive in material covered than the CAT and are only one part of your whole application. \n \nStudents also need to prepare their professional CVs, speak to professors for recommendation letters, write individual essays for each college, and ready themselves for interviews. In the strongest applications, each of these components is well-rounded. \n \nStudents may help themselves greatly by gaining experience in their respective field through internships and work experiences. Colleges often try to \u201clook beyond the numbers,\u201d for applicants\u2014looking beyond just marks. Work experience, an understanding of one\u2019s own caliber, and plentiful involvement with social projects and campus service all go toward strengthening the applicant\u2019s profile \n \nIt is important to receive right counseling in navigating these requirements. A good counselor can help shortlist colleges according to \u201cfit,\u201d i.e. through their suitability for individuals instead of blindly following rankings. Counseling can introduce you to programs like HBS 2+2 or YLP or even similar courses likes MIM, LBS etc. By working with an experienced mentor, you can maximize chances of admission by picking the right courses and the right schools. They can also help write essays showcasing yourself most positively, run through mock interviews with you, and keep your focus on the final goal\u2014admission at a top university! A mentor can also help you apply to correct scholarships and funding sources, as expenses are a major concern for all applicants. Ensure your counselor is suggesting the best colleges for you, not their own pocket. \n \nThere are many non-Indian options for higher education. If one does badly in CAT\/GMAT\/GRE, they can apply to Singapore\/UK. Many colleges do not even require GMAT scores and only require undergraduate marks. However, you must be careful as both countries have several sub-standard institutions that are moneyspinners, not educational enterprises. But colleges like Bath, CASS, LSE, LBS, NUS, SMU, and NTU have tremendous value. \n \nFor CAT you must prepare all year, and be judged on one exam. Since there is only one round a year, risks are high and students eventually have fewer choices. Applying to the US\/UK\u2019s top MBA programs allows for much more autonomy in the process. At the same time, you will be exposed to world-leading resources, cutting-edge facilities, global networking opportunities, and an international peer group. While it might seem scary, with the right guidance you can achieve admission to top MBA programs worldwide. \n \nThe writer, Mr. Rohan Ganeriwala, is the Co-founder, of Collegify, an educational institute for study abroad)","title":"Life Beyond CAT & MAT!!","media-type":"News","source":"This Week Bangalore","published":"2015-09-22T15:07:41Z"}

Lake County Sheriff's Office spokesman Sgt. Christopher Covelli said hundreds of officers were involved in the exhaustive search in Fox Lake following the killing of Lt. Charles Joseph Gliniewicz on Tuesday morning. But to no avail. \"That means we're not searching within that perimeter area anymore. The suspects were not within our perimeter,\" Covelli told The Associated Press Wednesday morning. \"We had over 400 police officers out here yesterday. We had over 45 canine units and numerous aircraft,\" he said, adding that officers would now conduct \"saturation patrols\" in a wider area. Authorities from across the state and region joined the\u00a0manhunt\u00a0Tuesday in the village about 60 miles north of Chicago. Some wore tactical gear and toted high-powered rifles. Officers took up positions on rooftops and along railroad tracks, scanning the terrain with rifle scopes and binoculars. Others leaned out of helicopters with weapons at the ready. Federal agencies, SWAT teams and 48 police dogs assisted in the\u00a0manhunt, Covelli said. Residents of the usually sleepy village were urged to stay indoors, and schools were on lockdown. In a statement late Tuesday, Covelli urged the community to reach out with tips and leads. Covelli said Gliniewicz radioed in Tuesday morning to tell dispatchers he was chasing three men on foot. Communication with him was lost soon after. Covelli said backup officers found him injured with a gunshot wound and that he died soon after. An emotional Fox Lake Mayor Donny Schmit described the slain officer as a personal friend, a three-decade member of the department and a father of four sons. \"We lost a family member,\" Schmit said of the 52-year-old officer known around town as \"GI Joe.\" ''His commitment to the people of this community has been unmatched and will be dearly missed.\" The area near the Wisconsin border area is popular for boating and other outdoor pursuits because of its forest preserves and a chain of lakes that partly encircles Fox Lake. Some longtime city dwellers move to the region for what is normally a quieter lifestyle. Authorities urged residents to stay home while they searched for the suspects, two of them white and the other black. Commuter train service was halted, and residents who wanted to take their dogs out to relieve themselves were told to stay inside, with the job of walking the pets handled by police officers. Several schools were locked down Tuesday, and seven cancelled classes on Wednesday, Covelli said. Gliniewicz's death is the third law enforcement fatality in Illinois this year, according to the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. It says firearms-related deaths in the U.S. are down 13 percent this year compared to the same period last year, Jan. 1. to Sept. 1; there were 30 last year and 26 this year. Fox Lake residents expressed sorrow at the death of the immensely popular Gliniewicz. \"This particular officer is a pillar in my community and (is) definitely going to be missed, and (he) touched so many lives,\" said Gina Maria, a 40-year-old teacher. Dozens gathered for hours along a street in the village to show their support for law enforcement officers. Thirty-year-old Dan Raminick, who held a sign reading \"Police Lives Matter,\" said officers came by Tuesday evening and thanked the crowd. Caitlyn Kelly, a 22-year-old student, said she felt compelled to come out after other recent police shootings. She held a sign that said \"Blue and Brave.\"","title":"Hunt for 3 suspects in Illinois officer's death continues","media-type":"News","source":"Wicked Local Boxborough","published":"2015-09-01T19:48:55Z"}

{"id":"47421ff9-52ab-479e-8bbc-841ff295795c","content":"In part 1 of this series I discussed the deeply discounted preferred shares of National Bank of Greece (NYSE:NBG) and the bank\u2019s difficult path forward. Here, I\u2019ll take a look at the deeply discounted preferred shares of Fannie Mae (OTCQB:FNMA) which have some similarities but a lot more differences. Background Most people know Fannie Mae and its cousin Freddie Mac (OTCQB:FMCC) as two companies that required a massive bailout and were taken over by the government. But there is much more to the story. Instead of actually acquiring all the equity of Fannie and Freddie, the Treasury acquired a senior preferred stock stake with a 10% dividend and warrants to purchase 79.9% of the common stock of each. In 2012, the Treasury modified the agreement ending the 10% dividend and replacing it with a net worth sweep where payments would not count towards reducing the outstanding Treasury-owned preferred stock. Since then, profits at Fannie and Freddie have surged and the companies have returned more money to the Treasury than they were provided in total. Despite this, dividends on the privately-owned preferred shares remain suspended since all profits are still taken in the net worth sweep. Prospects Under the status quo, the preferreds have no value except as bets on a change since there would not be any profits left at the company to pay them. But a variety of stakeholders from hedge fund managers to consumer advocates are challenging the legality of the net worth sweep in the courts and even proposing their own solutions. At the same time, political plans are being drawn up to reform the mortgage system with varying outcomes for Fannie and Freddie stakeholders. Full recovery Like most large financial firms, Fannie Mae has a long list of preferred series but all of them have their dividends suspended, trade around 15 cents on the dollar, and are not convertible (with the exception of the $100,000 liquidation value convertible FNMFO shares). This implies a potential gain of 550% to liquidation value. Full recovery to liquidation value would require the dividends to be restored which could only happen after the net worth sweep is ended. I won\u2019t go into an extended legal discussion as many SA authors have already done an excellent job of this but to summarize it would likely require a court to find the 2012 amendment that created the net worth sweep to be overturned. There is also the possibility that Congress could take action to end the net worth sweep as part of a broad-based mortgage reform package. However, given that current plans have relied upon wiping out private investors, I view a political solution as far less likely. Delayed recovery It is important to recognize that the return to liquidation value would not immediately follow an end of the net worth sweep. Fannie and Freddie would likely have to grow capital levels to create a capital cushion to protect against a future mortgage downturn. Bill Ackman, manager of Pershing Square (OTCPK:PSHZF), has proposed a 2.5% requirement but that would still require a few years to raise done solely through retained earnings. Since the preferred shares are non-cumulative, Fannie Mae may choose to keep preferred dividends suspended until capital levels are rebuilt. With preferred dividends suspended but the net worth sweep ended, I would expect the preferred shares to trade at around 75 cents on the dollar until dividends are restored. This valuation would be similar to those of the preferred shares of Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS) and National Bank of Greece when the dividend remained suspended but a reinstatement appeared near. This situation would imply roughly 400% upside from current levels. Settlement or conversion to common As the plaintiffs continue to press their claims against the net worth sweep, the government may choose to opt for a settlement rather than pursue a long costly case it may end up losing. It\u2019s unknown what valuation a settlement would offer although the plaintiffs are likely to push for a substantial sum given the amount they have invested in Fannie and Freddie. A settlement could also come in multiple forms including an upfront cash payment, conversion to common shares, or rolling into a new class of preferred. Recently Dick Bove speculated that a settlement in the Fannie and Freddie cases may be near based on request from the White House. In my view, this is just speculation and not necessarily indicative of an upcoming settlement. However, this does not mean a settlement can be ruled out now or in the future. Wipeout Fannie and Freddie preferred are trading at 15 cents on the dollar for two main reasons: The potential for total loss and the potential for a resolution to take several years. Until the net worth sweep is ended, these preferreds only have value as bets on a potential future outcome. This does not necessarily make them bad investments but without a change to the net worth sweep investors have little chance at receiving capital appreciation or dividends. The preferred also have the potential for total loss in the event that the plaintiffs lose their cases or give up for any reason. Given what the plaintiffs have invested, I expect them to pursue their cases to the end but circumstances can change so a change in strategy cannot be ruled out. The plaintiffs could also lose their legal cases since courts are unpredictable and could interpret the law in multiple ways. At that point, investors would be reliant upon a much less likely solution from Congress that gives private investors value. Fannie Mae preferred takeaway Although the preferred dividends remain suspended, the company could easily pay them if the net worth sweep was ended. However, the current legal and political situation throws a lot of risk and uncertainty into these shares causing them to trade at a significant discount. As with most preferreds at 15 cents on the dollar, Fannie Mae preferreds remain a speculative investment. But those with a long-term investment horizon and a tolerance for risk may want to consider a position in these shares.

{"id":"16fd529a-4100-4a1d-badd-5eebcad41edb","content":"Renewable energy is developed from renewable sources such as Solar, Wind,\u00a0Hydroelectric, Geothermal and\u00a0Biomass. These are the sources which do not deplete upon use, whereas conventional energy sources such as Fossil Fuels (Oil, Gas and Coal) are constantly exhausting due to being limited in quantity and continually increasing consumption. A study reveals that the Fossil fuels currently available for consumption might last only until 2050, if they are continuedly consumed at the present rate. This is because they are definitely a finite quantity, and also because the rate of discovery of new sites and their extraction is lower than the current rate of their consumption. The most astonishing fact is that what's going to happen when we don't have an alternative at hand, keeping in view that 85% of our current energy needs are met from the fossil fuel sources. Why conventional energy sources must be replaced with renewables? Besides the threat of their complete extinguishing one day, the fossil fuels are a major cause of disturbing our ecosystem because they cause environmental pollution, Carbon emissions (resulting in global warming and Climate Change) and increasing health hazards (thus causing more healthcare expenditure). These environmental disturbances are a major background to the extreme weathers, rising sea levels becoming floods, frequent earthquakes and destruction; thus increasing costs on infrastructure maintenance and recovery. Although Energy production from the conventional sources is relatively cheap, the reason being these are abundantly available in many parts of the world, yet the world is forced to look towards energy alternatives due to their backdrops and extinguishing quantity.\nAnother plus point of renewables is that a common man can easily have a setup of renewable energy sources to meet the domestic energy needs and thus avoid being a burden on the national grid, hence contributing to saving national costs. For example, installing Solar Panels on rooftops can help a great deal in lowering or minimizing the electricity bills we pay to our national departments. While, the common man cannot setup high costing and infrastructure rich coal-powered electricity generating plants or thermal power plants for meeting the domestic energy needs.\nWe also need to be aware that the equipment deployed in generating renewable energy is also produced by consuming fossil fuel energy, thus the world should be quick in producing enough alternative energy equipment before the fossil fuel sources perish.\nComparing energy production costs of conventional and renewable energy sources At present, the cost of energy production from renewable sources is relatively more than that of energy production from fossil fuels. This is because the renewable energy equipment is not being produced abundantly, whereas conventional energy sources are abundantly available and being utilized. But what needs to be looked at is the long-term cost of both the alternative choices. If we need a safe environment for our coming generations (and we definitely do) along with ample assurances that they live in peace and rest, we need to take steps that if otherwise not taken would lead them to disasters and wars.\nTaking the present and future costs of maintaining infrastructure, health and ecosystem (destroyed by energy production from fossil fuels) into consideration, it is evident that we are wasting a lot of resources and time that we could avoid by employing alternative energy production from Wind, Solar, Hydroelectric, Geothermal and Biomass.\nProduced by Solarwow.co.uk\nSource","title":"Why the need for renewable energy?","media-type":"Blog","source":"Passionate Blogging Point","published":"2015-09-02T20:31:00Z"}

{"id":"3b985539-a695-4edd-826d-3b343967cef8","content":"Sageworks\u2019 new Electronic Tax Return Reader automatically imports data, improving efficiency and accuracy. \n \n\nThe $2.1 billion, Briarwood, N.Y.-based Melrose Credit Union is giving rave reviews of its experience with the Raleigh, N.C.-based Sageworks\u2019 new Electronic Tax Return Reader, which the credit union said helps improve underwriting efficiency. \n\nSageworks introduced the Electronic Tax Return Reader as a major time-saving enhancement to its suite of credit risk management solutions for financial institutions. The complimentary upgrade automatically imports data from borrowers\u2019 tax returns. \n\n\u201cI am ecstatic with this product so far,\u201d Steven Krauser, senior vice president of retail operations for Melrose CU, told CU Times . \n\nHe explained that because the credit union's lending portfolio is so diverse, systematizing the evaluation of its underwriting process was a priority. Based on the NCUA's requirements, the credit union needed to provide the matrix for evaluating a loan in a standardized manner across all product lines. \n\nKrauser, who joined Melrose CU about a year ago, explained one of his goals was to study what the credit union could do better and began researching software that would allow him to do that. \n\n\u201cWe started in business in 1922 in taxi medallion financing,\u201d Krauser said. \u201cWe have a significant portfolio in that. That is one reason we wanted to get involved in this.\u201d \n\nThe credit union also desired the ability to flag any problems in advance by adjusting and stress testing its portfolio, and to quantify and maintain its methodology. \n\nMelrose CU, which has an open charter and one branch, investigated which lending modules would integrate with its core system's existing data as well as standardize underwriting within its departments. The Sageworks suite, Krauser explained, allows the credit union to stress test its portfolio based on numerous factors such as loan to value, debt service coverage ratio changes and interest rate increases. \n\nThe credit union started fully underwriting with the system on Aug. 4, 2015. \n\n\u201cThe quality of the underwriting analysis has increased dramatically,\u201d Krauser pointed out, adding that the timesaving benefit will come later on. \u201cThe reason it is not there yet is that it is new and we\u2019re still learning what to do, so there still is a learning curve.\u201d \n\nLibby Berman, an analyst for Sageworks, said, \u201cOur bread and butter at Sageworks has always been commercial loans and business lending, so the tax packages we support are mostly those commercial properties that accounting firms used for their businesses. We supply our financial institution clients with products that help them comply with regulations and improve their efficiency.\u201d \n\nThe Electronic Tax Return Reader works by optically \u201creading\u201d electronic tax returns produced by many common tax packages, allowing for the creation of digital returns in the Sageworks system, where other financial information is also imported and stored. The program also benefits credit departments that analyze commercial real estate borrower information, as it also automatically populates Schedule E financial information for real estate properties. \n\nSageworks said the enhancement allows credit unions to save a significant amount of time. \n\n\u201cOur users are spending about 30 minutes per return on average, and obviously, some tax returns are much more complex with many real estate properties,\u201d Berman pointed out. \n\nThrough this program and its technology, that time can be pared down to two to three minutes, he said. \n\n\u201cI don't know that a lot of our clients even knew this technology was feasible,\u201d Berman added. \u201cIt has just been a recurring theme since we got into the credit analysis business, making sure that data was accurate and entered quickly. It is something people kind of expected. This will proactively solve most of those problems.\u201d \n\nIn addition to saving users time, the Electronic Tax Return Reader aims to reduce errors that can occur during the manual data entry process, and ensure consistency and accuracy during the production of commercial borrower spreads within the Sageworks Credit Analysis tool. For applicable tax returns, the technology ensures different analysts across an institution are inputting data the same way, which helps give credit unions a strong defense during exams. \n\nBerman said Sageworks also helps clients maintain consistency. \n\n\u201cIn the past, maybe there were multiple people entering data, and it is very easy to transpose numbers or enter something on the wrong line,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe auto import helps eliminate inconsistencies and errors. The system also allows the financial institution the capability to go back in and make adjustments.\u201d \n\nMelrose CU implemented Sageworks\u2019 entire suite of cloud-based products about three and a half months ago, Krauser said. \n\n\u201cWithin that time, we were able to learn it, train our people, create a test site, play with it and then map our fields from our core system into the Sageworks system,\u201d he noted. \n\nKrauser said Sageworks performs all calculations for Melrose CU. \n\n\u201cIt gives us the debt to service coverage ratio, loan to value and matrix on individual loans that we are doing, plus it gives us all the same information on global cash flow for those individuals and does it for our entire portfolio on that individual. So if you have a loan here and you are asking for a car loan, we can do the analysis on that car loan to see if it makes [financial] sense.\u201d \n\nCurrently, Melrose CU uses Sageworks\u2019 tools for its commercial real estate department, taxi medallion lending area and business services unit. Krauser explained the credit union will eventually introduce Sageworks into its personal lending area as well, but first, it wants to gain full confidence using the tools for the largest portion of its lending business. \n\n\u201cWe have a real robust program here, and we want to make sure we have all the pieces and understand the full breadth and depth of it before we introduce it into other aspects,\u201d Krauser said. \u201cIt is really a great automation of the process.\u201d \n\nScott Ogle, CEO for Sageworks, noted, \u201cSageworks offers solutions that simplify the complex processes that financial institutions handle every day. A key objective when developing or enhancing our solutions is to maximize time and efficiency. With our customer needs in mind, we developed the Electronic Tax Return Reader to become an integral component of each of our banking solutions, as it will save hours of manual data entry over the life of the solution.\u201d \n\nSageworks Credit Analysis allows credit unions to book loans faster, and with consistency and transparency, while also managing risk, the company said. The global cash flow analysis solution presents tax return input screens that create spreads, dynamic narrative analysis and customizable credit memos. \n\n\u201cThis is also important to those credit unions that are getting into more member business lending, who may not feel they have the right staff in place,\u201d Berman asserted. \u201cThey can use a program like this to take care of some of the more manual work and allocate time more effectively to the actual analysis.\u201d \n\nBerman pointed out the credit analysis tool also helps credit unions prepare for exams, especially those that had trouble in the past with credit decision inconsistencies and file errors.","title":"Sageworks Automates Tax Data for Credit Unions","media-type":"News","source":"Credit Union Times","published":"2015-09-18T04:00:00Z"}
{"id":"4f6f2160-e229-43e5-a018-31885729089f","content":"FRANKFURT, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tenneco (NYSE:TEN) today unveiled its latest generation of electronically controlled valves at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show. The valves, which are designed to support low pressure exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) for diesel engines and acoustic tuning for gasoline engines, feature a unique new modular design which offers vehicle manufacturers custom flexibility and adaptability for any engine architecture. \n\nThis Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20150916005157\/en\/ \n\nTenneco's latest generation electronic valves feature a unique new modular design, which offers vehicle manufacturers custom flexibility and adaptability for any engine architecture. (Photo: Business Wire) \n\n\"We've seen a dramatic shift with our valve technology since its introduction just three years ago,\" said Tim Jackson, executive vice president and chief technology officer, Tenneco. \"Tenneco's latest generation valve has evolved to a modular, scalable design that is lightweight, can be easily packaged to fit within any engine architecture and offers on-demand customization, which provides significant cost and time savings for customers. Additionally, the valve can accommodate exhaust temperature specifications up to 750\u00b0C for EGR applications, which enables efficient NOx reduction - even with highly loaded engine conditions and high return flow rates.\" Tenneco's latest generation valve features a dynamic flap control designed to generate optimal pressure conditions for efficient EGR and also provides fail-safe operation. The actuator is interchangeable using a simple mounting concept without any loose interface components and the valve's flexible actuator orientation allows for simple installation in any engine control environment, without the need to change parts. \n\nThe valve delivers important acoustical benefits as well. Whether during engine start or while idling, the flap minimizes internal leakage, which helps to optimize sound quality. The electronically controlled variable flap remains closed during normal driving conditions for a quieter ride and opens during harder acceleration, creating lower backpressure, higher attenuation and more engine power for maximum efficiency. \n\n\"Tenneco's new valve design serves as another important example of how our emissions technologies serve as enablers for improving fuel efficiency and helping customers meet important emissions regulations like EU6c, while maximizing engine performance,\" Jackson said. \"In the future, we'll continue to see valve technology evolve into hotter areas of the vehicle and we are already in development with valves that provide exhaust heat recovery solutions to address that need.\" \n\nTenneco is displaying these and other clean air and ride performance technologies at its exhibit during the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show, September 15-27, Hall 5.1, Stand A20. \n\nTenneco is an $8.4 billion global manufacturing company with headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois and approximately 29,000 employees worldwide.Tenneco is one of the world's largest designers, manufacturers and marketers of clean air and ride performance products and systems for automotive and commercial vehicle original equipment markets and the aftermarket.Tenneco's principal brand names are Monroe\u00ae, Walker\u00ae, XNOx\u2122 and Clevite\u00aeElastomer.

Jonathan Sacks said it was time for human compassion to triumph in the same way as the scheme that saved thousands of Jewish children before the second world war broke out. He said that a \u201cvery clear and conspicuous humanitarian gesture, like Kindertransport\u201d would help to achieve that aim. \u201cEurope is being tested as it has not been tested since the second world war \u2026 The European Union was created as a way of saying that we recognise human rights, after the catastrophe of two world wars and the Holocaust, and it\u2019s very chilling to see some of these scenarios being re-enacted,\u201d Lord Sacks told BBC2\u2019s Newsnight on Thursday.

Reblog, answer and say what state\/region you teach in! I\u2019m curious\u2026 \n\n\nAt my old school in NC yes we were required to submit them. In CO we have to have a plan book out on the off chance someone asks to see it, but no one has asked yet.\n\n\nAt my first school in ND I didn\u2019t have to. This year We submit them weekly- every other teacher in the school prints them off and turns them in, I just share a Doc online with all of my plans and materials linked in, but it has to be done by Friday evening. I\u2019m in IL now.\n\n\nNope, no submitting lesson plans. We do post a bare bones summary of the day\u2019s lesson on Schoology, but that\u2019s like\u00a0\u201cJournal, quotations, reading.\u201d plus any homework attachments. (I\u2019m in MN.)\u00a0\n\n\nWe are required to maintain a class website with weekly posted lesson agendas on it, so technically, yes. But I\u2019ve never once been asked a question about what I\u2019ve posted or had anyone notice when I posted late or forgot to post other than parents, so I don\u2019t think anyone in admin is actually looking at them. I\u2019m in TX.\n\n\nWe are not required to submit lesson plans (I teach at a private school).\u00a0\n\n\nNo lesson plan submission requirement here, or any other secondary schools in the area that I know of. I\u2019m in the in Bay Area in CA, and teach at a high school.\n\n\nYes weekly lesson plans required with hooks, activities, I can statements, standards addressed, etc. must be posted to our server by Monday at 8am. Atlanta, GA area\n\n\nNope. We\u2019re trusted to be professionals was what I was told when I got hired. I\u2019m in Maryland near DC. \n\n\nDown here in Straya (or at least in my state) we\u2019re not asked to submit lesson plans once we stop being students.\n\n\nNot weekly or daily lesson plans, although we are expected to have our day plan book uptodate. We submit long range bare bone plans in September but that\u2019s it and no one has ever checked to make sure we are following it.\n\n\n\nWe are not required to submit lesson plans, but we are expected to have them written and available upon request. \u00a0Also, if an administrator comes into our class they want to be able to easily access our written plan.

{"id":"44fc3bf2-c154-4df6-b0bd-7f4c26649dca","content":"The emergent problem of the dangerous drugs known as synthetics has been featured in several recent media accounts. Their use has grown strikingly, and because of their association with violent behavior, so has law enforcement concern. The rising trend was shown in reports of emergency episodes attributed to \u201csynthetic cannabinoids\u201d by the District of Columbia Fire and EMS departments. Episodes had been stable at fewer than fifty cases a month from August, 2012, until roughly November of that year, when they spiked to over a hundred. \n \nThat number subsided until approximately January of 2015, when they began an unprecedented, and persisting, climb. By June of 2014, the last data point captured, they reached 439 cases, an apparent increase of nearly 800 percent since the end of the year. \n \nOur attention has been triggered by some horrendous episodes involving consumption of synthetics, including an alleged stabbing death that has the city, already known for far greater use of the synthetic hallucinogen PCP among arrestees than other major cities, on edge. \n \nHas some underlying factor driven synthetic cannabinoid use in the nation\u2019s Capital, as shown by these emergency episodes? What has changed that could affect either drug availability, or the acceptability of increased use, of this dangerous set of compounds? \n \nThere is a correlation found in the timing. In November of 2014, District voters made news by approving legal \u201cnatural\u201d cannabinoid use in the city \u2013 that is, marijuana. Then, in January of this year, the legalization took effect, with an increase in public consumption, while police backed away. Both developments seem to be echoed in the data. \n \nWe must confront a disturbing question: by allowing \u201cnatural\u201d marijuana to increase in acceptance, could the District have sowed the wind of the synthetic cannabis whirlwind? \n \nAdvocates for drug legalization recognize that connection, but their response is the predictable resort of pro-marijuana advocates.  Legalizers explain the increased use of synthetics as a consequence of the prohibition on \u201cnatural cannabis.\u201d But that had ended just before the epidemic began. So how could prohibition be forcing the problem? The response from legalizers is revealing, as it discloses their next target in District policies: workplace drug testing. Since many synthetic users believe that they are not readily detected by potential employers, they must be substituting them for the \u201cnatural\u201d marijuana product. \n \nSo for legalizers, it is still the \u201cpunitive criminal justice system\u201d that somehow incentivizes use of dangerous synthetic toxins. As they perennially argue, it is our crack-down on marijuana that drives consumers to more dangerous drugs. \n \nFor advocates, the problem with marijuana legalization in the District is not that it led to a disturbing shift in the attitudes and norms of drugs use. It\u2019s that it didn\u2019t go far enough. We didn\u2019t legalize sales, as well as use. And employers (like the Federal Government) still insist on drug-testing applicants. And because drug users want jobs, they have to use synthetics. \n \nOddly, before November when \u201cnatural marijuana\u201d was prohibited, this argument failed; there was then no spike in synthetic use, even though marijuana users were still, as now, subjected to drug tests. \n \nThe legalizer solution? Legalize marijuana sales, but most importantly, eliminate workplace testing. That will surely end the demand for synthetics. \n \nIt\u2019s possible that the cause of the current epidemic is, as legalizers argue,  this complicated incentive effect. But isn\u2019t it simpler, and more faithful to the data, to posit that the District made a huge, predictable mistake when it opened the flood gates to legalized marijuana, and thereby shifted the entire drug using landscape towards an epidemic? \n \nThe argument is not far-fetched. Perceptions and norms of disapproval matter for those contemplating drug use, and survey data are clear that for youth, there is a strong correlation between one prior behavior and use of synthetic drugs. Data from a study overseen by the National Institute of Drug Abuse showed that the use of \u201cnatural\u201d marijuana is, in fact, a \u201cgateway\u201d for synthetic use. In fact, the use of synthetics by those who hadn\u2019t previously used marijuana is 0.5 percent; that is, almost never. \n \nThe true common sense understanding of the tragedy happening right before us is that the District of Columbia, by legalizing marijuana, produced a completely predictable effect. It made drug use more acceptable, and rendered police control more difficult. Sadly, as drugs of all sorts begin to flood the streets, the District is experiencing a rapidly-unfolding train wreck, of its own devising.","title":"Synthetic Problem: Has D.C.

The to cities and low interest loans to recycling companies.\n\nThe first three recycling investments total $24 million.\n\nClosed Loop Fund\u2019s first investee is a joint venture between QRS and Canusa-Hershman (CHR) to create a one-of-a-kind plastic recovery facility (PRF) in Baltimore, Maryland. Currently, 70 percent of communities across the US are not able to collect and recycle #3-#7 plastics, like yogurt containers and take out packaging or large rigid plastics such as crates, buckets, baskets and lawn furniture.\n\nThe Closed Loop Fund says tor the first time ever, QRS and CHS will combine technology that can both separate these products and turn them back into raw materials for new products and packaging. The facility is able to process 4,500 tons of materials every month \u2014 double the capacity of what\u2019s presently possible in the US.\n\nBeginning in October, QRS-CHR will service the majority of the East Coast, from Maine to South Carolina, increasing recycling rates and finally providing a recycling solution for #3-#7 plastics. The fund expects the opening of the facility to help divert 440,000 tons from landfills and reduce 555,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nClosed Loop Fund\u2019s two other investments are in Quad Cities, Iowa, and Portage County, Ohio, both important Midwest markets for recycling. These investments will allow the two communities to convert from dual-stream recycling systems to single-stream, making it easier for citizens to recycle. These communities are similar to hundreds across the south and Midwest with citizens who want to recycle, but without a convenient option.\n\nThe fund says over the next 10 years, in Portage County alone, 37,000 tons will be diverted from landfills with a reduction of 110,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions. It expects Quad Cities to see 86,000 tons diverted from landfills and 250,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions reduced.\n\nLack of infrastructure is a major barriers to more recycling in the US. In 2013, lack of recycling infrastructure caused US cities to collectively spend over $5 billion dollars to landfill over $11 billion worth of commodities that could have been recycled, according to the Closed Loop Fund.\n\nBy 2025, Closed Loop Fund aims to do the following","title":"Recycling \u2018Game Changer\u2019 Gets $24M Cash Injection","media-type":"News","source":"Environmental Leader","published":"2015-09-28T11:26:20Z"}

Today it was exactly the same. One shot at the edge of the box and one corner were all the offensive volume West Ham had in the whole game. \n \n\"We must concentrate more because two balls decided the result.\" \n \nCity had to make a late change to the side after playmaker David Silva withdrew before kick-off. \n \nPellegrini said: \"I don't want to have the excuse of David Silva why we didn't win. I don't think there was one player that would change the story. \n \n\"David had a kick in his calf and he tried in the warm-up but he felt his muscle was stiff so he didn't play.\" \n \nPellegrini, who added that defender Eliaquim Mangala was taken off at half-time with a muscle injury, dismissed suggestions his team may have been over-confident. \n   Promoted stories   \nHe said: \"We never believed that because we won five games we were the champions of the Premier League. \n \n\"We have to play 32 games more, 96 points to play for, so nobody can believe that.\" \n \nFor West Ham, the result represented another notable away scalp under new boss Slaven Bilic after also winning at Arsenal and Liverpool. \n \nBilic said: \"It is a surprise, let's be honest. This game was different from Emirates and Anfield. With the greatest respect to Liverpool and Arsenal, this team (City) are the best in the league. \n \n\"We knew we would have to score goals to get something, we knew we would have to run like crazy, and we knew would have to be lucky. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to stop them for 90 minutes but we have done it. \n \n\"We didn't nick it. It would have been fair if they equalised, but we also had chances. \n \n\"That is why I am so proud of our performance. The guys have done brilliantly, not only fighting-wise but also playing-wise.\" \n \nThe Hammers now have 12 points from their six games, just three less than leaders City, but Bilic is not getting carried away. \n \nHe said: \"There is a tiny line between confidence and arrogance or confidence and laziness. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n\"It is hard not to get carried away a little but that is also part of my job to install in their heads that we are good, but that you have to know what to do to stay good. \n \n\"There are going to be ups and downs, we are not Real Madrid, but it is looking very good now.\"","title":"Manuel Pellegrini upset by defensive errors as Manchester City lose to West Ham","media-type":"News","source":"Craven Herald","published":"2015-09-19T22:03:17Z"}

{"id":"9dec5203-5be1-4903-aba3-95d3c923f676","content":"Read comprehensive player profiles on all the Milton Ulladulla Bulldogs WLT players for 2015. \n\nRead a full WLT preview here. \n\nRead the highlights from the 2014 grand final here. \n\nTHE Milton-Ulladulla Bulldogs will attempt to do what no women\u2019s league tag team has done in the competition\u2019s history.\n\nThe Bulldogs hope to claim successive Group 7 premierships, when they take on Kiama at Collegians Sporting Complex on Sunday.\n\nBulldogs' captain Cheyanne Hatch said she was so proud that her team was the only team in the entire senior Group 7 competition to remain undefeated in the 2015 season. \n\nThe Bulldogs women have the best defence points in the competition, although Cheyanne said this adds even more pressure for Sunday's grand final.\n\n\"We aren't going into the game too cocky but we are confident we can take it out,\" she said.\n\n\"As a captain, and on behalf of my Dad as coach, we have every bit of belief in every single one of the girls. \n\n\"The difference between us and any other team this year is we play as a team, as one and for each other.\" \n\nCheyanne added that there is no better feeling than playing alongside her best friends and sharing the laughs and exciting memories each week with the Bulldogs family. \n\n\"It will be a tough game against our rivalry Kiama, as every game this year against them has been so close,\" she said. \n\n\"We have almost climbed our mountain and are prepared to come out firing for Sunday's game to reach that mountain and do the Milton Ulladulla Bulldogs club, supporters, families and ourselves proud.\" \n\nKick off for the women is 8.30am with the gates open at 7.30am.\n\nAdmission is $15 for adults, $9 for concession and children under 16 are free.\n\nSo, without further adieu, meet the 2015 Bulldogs women.\n\nAfter taking out Group 7\u2019s and Milton Ulladulla\u2019s top point scorer and most tries scored in 2014, Ebony has had yet again a massive season. \n\nEb was not able to back up her titles due to missing out on five games because of being overseas, but she is still second in the competition with 14 tries, 45 goals and a total of 146 points. \n\nBack in time for the finals, Eb is ready to help the girls get the win with her swerving attack and 100 per cent kicking abilities \u2013 a standout in the team and best fullback in the competition by far.\n\nThe hips of the team! \n\nGeorgia\u2019s second year with the doggies, she says there is no better way to spend her weekends than travelling down the coast to play. Georgia is unstoppable and does not stop swiveling her hips! Georgia is always hard to tag and will be using her hip swivel to break the line in Sunday\u2019s game. \n\nGeorgia has played years and years of Oztag and this will show come Sunday!\n\nCurrently representing NSW CHS at the national touch football championships (also leading try scorer up in QLD), Taryn will be landing back just in time for the WLT grand final. \n\nA little weapon, nothing will stop her! \n\nDaughter of the Bulldogs' first grade coach Orbit (who wishes he could sign a deal with Taryn), she shines every week with her speed and fast pace, making herself impossible to catch. \n\nTaryn was put into the fullback role while Ebony was away and plays like Jarryd Hayne; anywhere on the field, any position.\n\nPaige is known as the Robbie Farah of the team. \n\nPaige is the \u2018go forward\u2019 and helps to get the girls on a role. \n\nHer ball movement throughout the middle of the field and non-stop communication will be important in Sunday\u2019s game. \n\nShe is the team\u2019s motivation and has filled the team with positivity the whole season! \n\nThere are never any heads dropped while Paigey is around. \n\nPaige's loud mouth and positive energy will help push the girls and get them fired and pumped ready to go. \n\nOne of Paige\u2019s biggest achievements this year is being the only player to kick a 40\/20!\n\nAmy was born in Milton hospital and is a life-long sporting achiever, representing several teams at higher levels. \n\nIt is Amy\u2019s third year with the Bulldogs, and she will be hoping to win a back-to-back premiership alongside the girls. \n\nAmy\u2019s sporting experience will be a big impact on this weekend's game. \n\nAmy is a versatile player and an important utility, able to play any position in both attack and defence to continually stand out. \n\nLook out for her superman dives in defence and dodging stepping attack.\n\nCheyanne Hatch is the captain and leader of this great side. Cheyanne is the daughter of coach David Hatch, who has not only played years with the Cronulla Sharks and Australia, he has captained and coached more than 20 different teams. \n\nCheyanne is a huge threat in the Bulldogs side and has led the girls now into two grand finals. \n\nShe says she is so proud to be undefeated minor premiers but the job is not done until this Sunday. \n\nHer experience from years representing various representative touch football and Oz Tag sides will be shown on Sunday when the girls defend their premiership. \n\nCheyanne was also awarded Group 7 Player of the year for 2014, which was picked from all teams in the competition.\n\nAlso daughter of the Bulldogs' first grade coach, Orbit, Jaylee will be wearing the red, blue and white representing the doggies with pride. Born a true Milton Ulladulla Bulldog, she is one of our strongest link\/wingers.\n\nJaylee never-give-up attitude and improvement this year has been outstanding. \n\nShe continues to impress her team mates in every game and is a well respected player in this team. \n\nHer best game was when the Bulldogs defeated Kiama in the semi-final two weeks ago, where she has battle scars from diving and defending non-stop. \n\nJaylee not only has the height of the team but is always positively lifting the girls up as a team.\n\nAfter breaking her collarbone in the first game last year, the determination of this little skillful player proves that nothing would stop her return. \n\nWithout older sister Kaela Thomas (who was a stand out in last year's grand final), Georgia has really stepped up. \n\nShe has moves up her sleeve she plans to use on Sunday. \n\nShe has represented Australia in Oztag for several years and again her experience at a higher level will be important for Sunday\u2019s game. \n\nGeorgia\u2019s grubber kicks for herself and for the other girls attacking the line will be a strong point for the Doggies.\n\nGetting mistaken for Shaun Johnson and Roger Tuivasa Sheck, Ana has developed so much as a player this year.\n\nOne of the Dogs' ball players, she sets up a lot of plays and does not miss a tag in defence. \n\nShe loves the Bulldogs and says her favourite part of playing is spending her weekends with her best friends. \n\nHer best memory was winning the grand final last year and being a part of the Bulldogs family. \n\nAna\u2019s hip movements and non-stop defence will play an important role for the girls.\n\nOn debut for the Bulldogs this year, Rachel was always a touch head but decided she would give league tag a crack. \n\nRachel has improved immensely since game one and continues to surprise each game. \n\nLeague tag is not an easy game, but Rachel with her freakish nature and natural ability with a football was able to pick up the game straight away. \n\nRachel\u2019s ball movement from left to right is her biggest strength in the game and this will help trick the defence in Sunday's game.\n\nEmmah has grown up playing soccer her whole life but decided she would give league tag a try. \n\nShe has loved every aspect of the game so far, and with her speed and long legs Emmah is hoping to play her best in Sunday's game. It is Emmah\u2019s second year playing with the Bulldogs and every game she is determined to play her best and gives 100 per cent - that\u2019s what the team loves about her! \n\nEmmah was awarded player of the grand final last year, which was also her favourite Bulldogs memory.\n\nJess is the Bulldogs' backup goal kicker and was lucky enough to be put into the goal kicking role while Ebony was away. \n\nWith big shoes to fill, Jess had no worries of filling them, having a lot of strength behind her boot thanks to her soccer background. \n\nOne of the Bulldogs' strongest wingers in the team, her teammates have every bit of confidence in Jess defending, as she drops back to support the fullback and attacking the line out wide. Do not let Jess into open space as she will be very hard to catch.\n\nThis year was Tessa\u2019s first year with the Bulldogs. \n\nShe began looking up to her partner Stein Lofts (a Bulldogs first grade player of more than 17 years) and he has taught her a thing or two.\n\nHowever she is now teaching him how she uses those hips of hers to break through the defenders. \n\nTessa is definitely the team's best hole runner by far. \n\nTessa came into the team not knowing any of the girls well, now she is happy to say she has made 16 new friends and there is no better feeling playing alongside such a great bunch of girls.\n\nEmily is also away representing NSWCCC at the National touch Champions, making it back in time for Sunday's game. \n\nOnly 17-years-old, Emily is one of the strongest and fastest players across the park. \n\nIt is her first year with the Bulldogs, and what a great sign up she was. \n\nScoring a try almost every game, Emily is a little superstar! \n\nEmily was named in the Youth Rugby Union Australian 7\u2019s side and this can be shown through her speed and agility on the field. \n\nShe never stops smiling and puts in the gutsiest effort every game. \n\nEmily\u2019s favourite Bulldog moment was becoming minor premiers and she hopes to win her first premiership this Sunday, in turn helping the majority of the girls make it their second.\n\nAnother newbie of the team, Hannah has showed the whole season what playing tag is about. \n\nAlso only 17-years-old and an Australia Oztag representative, Hannah is the Bulldogs' weapon and will be a dark horse on Sunday. \n\nShe is planning on coming out strong and giving the other team a run for their money. \n\nHannah is also a try scoring machine and played her best game against Culburra, scoring herself six tries in one game. \n\nHannah bounces off the defence with her fast hips; she should be hard to tag.\n\nIt is Kiarna\u2019s third year with the Doggies and she is also hoping to win a back-to-back premiership. \n\nFrom day one Kiarna has been a part of the team, and not only her team mates, but also the coach have seen nothing but continuous improvements. \n\nShe plays rugby league, which can be shown through her aggression. \n\nKiarna\u2019s great communication and non-stop talking will help the girls in Sunday's game.\n\nCousin of Taryn and Jaylee, this awesome trio will be making the Love family proud on Sunday.\n\nA late sign-up into the team, this year is Riarnne\u2019s first time playing tag. \n\nBeing on debut, Riarnne has improved so much since game one. Her great attitude and positive influences on the girls will be important in Sunday's game. \n\nThe rest of the team cannot wait to share the grand final experience with Riarnne.","title":"Meet the Bulldogs' women's team","media-type":"News","source":"Milton Ulladulla Times","published":"2015-09-18T03:56:54Z"}
{"id":"372c91d3-1ab5-4ce2-9ab4-9d0ca8efc4b5","content":"The resounding endorsement by global leaders last week in New York of the groundbreaking and transformational 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, more than two years in the making, sparks new hope and optimism for multilateralism. \n \nThe 2030 Agenda, based on 17 goals and 169 targets, may seem overly ambitious to some, but poverty eradication cannot be sustained without comprehensive progress in economic growth, social justice and ecological sustainability. This is a bold and inspirational new roadmap that will guide us to more sustainable growth, which is resource-efficient and respects planetary boundaries\uff0dmeeting our present needs without mortgaging the wellbeing of future generations. \n \nThis change is urgently needed in the countries of Asia and the Pacific. Although our region has an impressive track record of economic growth and poverty reduction, more than 1.4 billion people still live in poverty, social disparities are widening and growth remains inefficient and wasteful. Our region has a shared responsibility to lead, which is why mainstreaming the 2030 Agenda in development plans and budgets, and backing them with strong oversight will be critical for successful implementation. \n \nFive conditions must be met to pave the way for Asia-Pacific governments to make this happen: \n \nFirst, sufficient financial resources are needed. The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) estimates that the Asia-Pacific region will need to invest between $2.1 trillion and $2.5 trillion per year to fund a comprehensive agenda for sustainable development. These resources are available: regional national savings total nearly $8.9 trillion, financial assets of the wealthiest regional individuals are estimated to be about $35 trillion, and foreign exchange reserves account for more than $7 trillion. Most of these sources of savings are currently adding to liquidity, held dormant in deposits or financing third-party country deficits. We need instead to effectively harness them along with unwavering political commitment to exploit domestic resources for development. Developing economies of our region have, on an average, among the lowest tax-to-GDP ratios in the world. Leveraging the potential of strengthened tax regimes is key; public interest must override the vested interests so that governments can remove tax exemptions and tackle tax evasion practices which are obstacles to investment in better access to basic services. \n \nSecond, good governance and inclusion has to be embedded in policy execution and implementation. The capacities of governments to engage multiple interest groups with widely varying perspectives, to effectively regulate excesses, monitor policy impacts and adjust policy responses are now critical. Governments must also become more adept at dealing with the unexpected and unpredictable events\uff0dand enabling all groups in society to respond positively to environmental, economic or social shocks. \n \nThird, innovations, new technologies and associated know-how must drive sustainable development across the region, yet innovation gaps in Asia and the Pacific remain very large. Only five Asia-Pacific countries are featured in the top 20 of the 2014 Global Innovation Index. Effective alignment and reinforcement of science, technology and innovation, through the right policies and regulatory frameworks as well as partnerships to facilitate technology transfer, will be mission-critical for successful sustainability. \n \nFourth, we need to pair innovation with resources, enabling countries to find and adapt the best policy options for sustainability. Partnerships and stronger, more diversified regional platforms for South-South cooperation, such as those provided by ESCAP and its Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development, provide great opportunities for our region to lead the way in ending poverty, transforming lives and protecting the planet. \n \nFifth, climate action must be integrated across all areas of policy and governance\uff0dsocial, environmental and economic. While emissions must be reduced through a focus on low-carbon energy, transportation and buildings and through energy efficiency, we must also build more resilient societies, prepared for frequent and extreme weather events and their impacts, such as changes in food production systems and migration. \n \nThe author, Shamshad Akhtar, is an under-secretary-general of the United Nations and executive secretary of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).

{"id":"eacc9625-b22d-4a44-a62e-7d53c132af1a","content":"\"It will provide major tax relief for middle income and for most other Americans. There will be a major tax reduction,\" Trump said Monday at a press conference at Trump Tower in New York as he unveiled his plan to revamp the tax code. \"It'll simplify the tax code, it'll grow the American economy at a level that it hasn't seen for decades.\"\n\nThe highly anticipated tax plan comes as Trump is being pressed to provide more details about how his administration would govern.\n\nOne of the biggest beneficiaries appears to be families that draw the smallest paychecks. Individuals that make less than $25,000 (and $50,000 for married couples) would pay no income taxes under Trump's plan.\n\nHowever, the proposal would also be a boon for the wealthiest Americans like Trump -- the top bracket includes individuals making $150,001 and more and couples making $300,001 and more -- who would pay an income tax rate of 25%. That's a dramatic cut from the current top rate of close to 40%.\n\nThe tax cuts for top earners could open Trump up to charges of hypocrisy. The real estate magnate has surged to the top of the polls by touting a populist tone, lamenting that wealthy people like himself should pay more.\n\nAsked at Monday's press conference how his proposal would affect his own tax rate, Trump dodged the question, saying: \"We're reducing taxes, but believe me, there will be people in the very upper echelon that won't be thrilled with this.\"\n\nHe also declined to say how much taxes he currently pays, only saying, \"I fight like hell to pay as little as possible.\"\n\nPerhaps the most pressing question that Trump must answer is how he would raise enough revenue to offset his plan's deep tax cuts, though he insisted Monday that his proposal would not add to the country's debt or deficit.\n\nThe candidate says he would make up for the difference in a number of ways: killing certain deductions for the rich and creating incentives for U.S. companies to bring back cash currently held overseas, thereby boosting growth at home.\n\nTrump's tax plan broadly mirrors that of one of his main rivals: Jeb Bush.\n\nBush's proposal released this month also reduces the number of income tax brackets -- to three from the current seven. The highest tax bracket under the former Florida governor's plan is 28%, and the lowest is 10%. Bush also proposed lowering the corporate tax rate from 25% to 20% -- another popular idea among conservatives. Trump would go even further, lowering the rate to 15%.\n\nLike Bush, one loophole Trump would target is the preferential treatment for carried interest, which is a share of profits paid to investment managers.\n\nSince launching his White House campaign in June, Trump has made sweeping attacks on hedge fund managers who are paid in carried interest.\n\nTrump, who claims that his personal assets are valued at more than $10 billion, frequently makes the distinction between investors who work in real estate and those on Wall Street. Hedge fund managers, he often says, fall in the category of special interests backing some of his well-connected and best-funded rivals.\n\n\"I know them. They all are supporting Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton,\" Trump told CNN at a campaign stop in Nashville, Tennessee, last month. \"They make a lot of money and a lot of it is luck. They pick a stock and all of a sudden they make a lot of money. I want the hedge fund guys to pay more taxes.\"\n\nStill, the plan might not be too tough on Wall Street. Since Trump's proposal would slash the income tax rate across the board, taxing carried interest as regular income under Trump's plan would mean investors still pay far less than what they would if the carried interest loophole were done away with under the current tax code.\n\nThe tax rate of hedge fund managers is a favorite political target for the 2016 presidential candidates.\n\n\"We will treat all noninvestment income the same, so unless you stake capital in an investment, you won't be able to claim the capital-gains tax rate on your market gains,\" Bush's tax proposal said.\n\nIt's also popular rallying cry for the Democratic candidates.\n\nFormer Secretary of Hillary Clinton has been hitting Wall Street tax breaks since the first days of her campaign, as she's faced pressure from progressive Democrats to embrace a more populist agenda. Antagonism towards Wall Street is a central message of Clinton's rivals like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley.","title":"Trump promises 'major tax relief' for most Americans","media-type":"News","source":"Las Vegas Review Journal","published":"2015-09-28T17:05:44Z"}

Gutierrez, Jr. \u2013 Innovator, Lawyer, Investor, Skateboarder \nPosted: 09\/22\/2015 5:53 pm EDT Updated: 09\/22\/2015 5:59 pm EDT \n \nSince its introduction in 2008, Bitcoin, the world\u2019s most recognized and \nfrequently used crypto-currency has continued to grow in popularity. \nBitcoin\u2019s peer-to-peer decentralized structure has steadily attracted \nglobal users seeking to make purchases and transfers of money digitally, \nprivately, and with minimal transaction costs. \n \nAt its current market cap of over $3 billion dollars, it is difficult to \nfind an area of the world which has not been touched by Bitcoin. Yet, \nuntil recently, Cuba was one of these places. With low levels of \ninternet penetration on the island, not only are few Cubans even aware \nof Bitcoin, but the lack of technical infrastructure can serve to impede \nthe ability of Cubans to undertake virtual currency transactions. \n \nInto this scenario, stepped in Fernando Villar. A first-generation \nCuban-American tech entrepreneur based in New Jersey, Fernando made his \nfirst visit to the island early this summer. As the founder of \nBitcoinCuba, Fernando\u2019s mission was twofold: visit family and experience \nthe county of his parent\u2019s birth and explore the capacity for Cubans to \nadopt virtual currency in their everyday lives. As a result, in \nmid-July, Fernando became the architect of a historical moment: Cuba\u2019s \nfirst documented Bitcoin transaction. \n \nI recently had the opportunity to sit down with Fernando to discuss his \nbackground, the goal of his organization, the potential of virtual \ncurrency in Latin America, and his trip to Cuba. Hope you enjoy! \n \nCG: Virtual currency is a relatively new and complex concept, what is \nyour background and what drew you to virtual currency\/Bitcoin? \n \nFV: I\u2019ve been working with digital technologies for over 6 years as a \nconsultant and designer. I was drawn to Bitcoin a few years ago. I heard \nabout it on a forum and researched the potential it had in facilitating \npayments, especially in the developing world. Bitcoin, in essence, is \ndigital cash and like the USD and Euro, can be used it to buy tangible \nthings. The only difference is that it isn\u2019t just money, it\u2019s the \ninternet of money. Bitcoin is a decentralized and deflationary currency \nbacked by math and not by a central bank or authority that can \nmanipulate it.This is a powerful technology because it eliminates the \nneed to rely on payment processors and banks. It\u2019s transparent with a \npublic ledger (blockchain), secure, nearly instant, and free for \neveryone to use. \n \nCG: You are the founder of BitcoinCuba. What\u2019s your organization\u2019s goal \nand why Cuba? In the short term, what will BitcoinCuba seek to \naccomplish? And in the long term? \n \nFV: BitcoinCuba\u2019s mission is to inform average Cubans and the small tech \ncommunity about the use of digital currencies like Bitcoin. Cubans have \nmuch to gain from using this currency and technology, especially now \nthat they are in a position to leapfrog current financial and \ntelecommunication infrastructures. \n \nCubans are not using credit or debit cards and most do not have a bank \naccount. Bitcoin and blockchain can serve the needs of the unbanked, \nincluding entrepreneurs and individuals on the island. For instance, an \nentrepreneur in Cuba can offer their goods or services and get paid for \nit by a customer any where in the world instantly. A family wanting to \nsend money to relatives in Cuba, using Bitcoin, would now have a method \nthat is faster and cheaper than ever. This will take some time to be a \nreality but it\u2019s already happening around the world. \n \nIn the short term, BitcoinCuba is planning on organizing workshops and \nconferences to inform and educate Cuban entrepreneurs and anyone who \ncares to know about this new technology. In the long term, BitcoinCuba \nwants to help facilitate a marketplace for digital currencies so that \nCubans can start using and developing Bitcoin technologies. \n \nCG: You recently completed the first documented Bitcoin Transaction in \nCuba. This event has been described by some observers as historic. Tell \nme about this transaction, how it came about, how you did it, and can \nyou also talk about some of the challenges to scaling the use of Bitcoin \nin Cuba. \n \nFV: I was taking a personal trip to Cuba to visit family on the island. \nThere had been reports about the new Wi-Fi networks in public parks and \nI wanted to test their connectivity. BitcoinCuba partnered with Chris \nGroshong, CEO of Coinstructive.com, a Cryptocurrency and Blockchain \nconsulting firm based out of San Diego. As soon as I bought a Wi-Fi card \nfrom one of the kids selling them in the park, I sent Chris an email to \ngo ahead and send Bitcoin in real-time to BitcoinCuba\u2019s public address. \nThe $20 Chris sent from San Diego made it to Havana in a few seconds \nusing Airbitz, a Bitcoin smartphone wallet with a fee of less than 1% . \nIt was validation that the government run Wi-Fi allows for these types \nof transactions. \n \nThe main challenges with scaling Bitcoin in Cuba are the lack of \neducation regarding digital currency and internet connectivity. Cuba has \na dual-currency system; there is one national peso for mass use which \nCubans are paid in, and a more valuable peso pegged to the USD known as \nthe CUC in which most good are sold in. Although the government has \ntalked about unifying both currencies, Bitcoin can be another currency \nthrown into the mix. There is going to be a need to teach individuals \nhow this new currency works and its value, which is why BitcoinCuba is \npartnering with Coinstructive and other groups in the Bitcoin community \nto facilitate the educational portion as well as galvanize a community \non the island that will hopefully learn all the ins and outs of Bitcoin \ntechnology. \n \nHowever, in order for Bitcoin and information to thrive, Cubans need \naccess to the internet. There is no other way around it. Cubans by and \nlarge don\u2019t have home connections, and access at hotels costs about $7 \nan hour, which is out of reach for most. The Wi-Fi parks with their \n$2\/hour service is a start, but companies like Google, Facebook, \nTwitter, Netflix and Airbnb, all who have recently come out and talked \nabout their interest in expanding their services in Cuba, can play an \nimportant role in helping to open up the internet for all Cubans. \n \nCG: Some observers believe that virtual currency can play an important \nrole in facilitating transactions in the developing world. What role do \nyou see virtual currency playing in the future of not only Cuba but also \nLatin America and other areas of the developing world? \n \nFV: The power of digital currencies like Bitcoin lies in the ability to \ncontrol your own money without any interjection from central banks, \nauthorities or governments. Essentially everyone can become their own bank. \n \nBitcoin is a solution that will help the majority of unbanked Cubans \nfinally tap into a the global market because it\u2019s almost effortless for \na recipient to setup a Bitcoin wallet on their smartphone even if they \ndon\u2019t have a bank account. In the case of Cuba, more people now have \niPhones and Androids sent from families abroad than have bank accounts. \n \nThe real break-through for Bitcoin in Cuba, Latin America, and the \ndeveloping world, is offering new ways of accepting payments and sending \nremittances where there is low credit card penetration and a reliance on \ncash. We are already seeing a disruption in the remittance market in \nAfrica and Asia with companies like BitPesa and Bitspark. In Latin \nAmerica, Bitcoin is making strides with remittance services, exchanges \nand startups in Argentina, Venezuela and Mexico. Because Bitcoin offers \nan instant and low-barrier solution, it will be a game-changer for Latin \nAmerica. \n \nCG: You mentioned you are Cuban-American. Many reports from the island \nnote the emergence of a growing tech savvy entrepreneurship oriented \ncommunity. Is there a role to be played by young Cuban-Americans such as \nyourself to collaborate with your counterparts on the island and help \nfoster the growth of such a community? Does a desire to do so exist? If \nso, what kind of activities can facilitate such interactions? \n \nFV: Bill Gates has said \u201cwhen people are empowered, they will use \ndigital technology to innovate on their own behalf.\u201d Cuban-American \nyoung professionals have the capacity to empower this growing group of \ntech savvy entrepreneurs in Cuba by establishing people-to-people \nconnections and sharing their knowledge with them. During my trip, the \ndigital entrepreneurs I spoke to are knowledgeable and hungry to learn \neven more. \n \nMy belief is that our generation of young entrepreneurs on the island \nand in the U.S. are not responsible for the political problems of the \npast, nor should we have it hanging over our heads forever. This is an \nincredible time in history where technology can solve many problems, and \nkeeping politics aside, we should be in a position to help give young \nCubans the tools and knowledge to innovate. I truly believe Bitcoin, \nblockchain and other digital technologies will be the tools used by \nCubans to develop their own future. \n \nCG: As a young entrepreneur with a grand vision, you are a role model \nfor all of us seeking to turn our dreams into reality. Any parting words \nof wisdom or advice on how you\u2019ve been able to do it? \n \nFV: Being an entrepreneur usually involves a series of missteps before \nfinally nailing the right idea. Most good ideas don\u2019t emerge from thin \nair, they involve a ton of thought and work to get it to be successful. \nBeing persistent is crucial because what might initially seem like a \nmisstep can derail a potentially good idea. \n \nAs relates to Cuba, the most important thing to do, as hard and \nimpossible as it may sound given the political strife between both \ncountries, is to remain optimistic and open. I\u2019ll never forget the \nreasons why my family was exiled from Cuba but I can try to forge a new \nfuture built on transparency and trust. It this happens, Cubans and \nAmericans can mutually benefit from each other. I believe digital \ntechnology can help build powerful connections between people that have \nbeen separated politically. If our two countries are going to build a \nnew relationship, our two tech communities should do so as well. I\u2019m \nexcited to see the innovations that will come when this happens. \n \nFollow Carlos M.

{"id":"e2fac553-db94-482f-bd60-1889853028da","content":"By KUNDUZ CITY, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Taliban fighters battled their way into the centre of Kunduz city in northern Afghanistan on Monday and seized the provincial governor's office, in one of the most serious security breaches in 14 years of war, witnesses and officials said.\n\nThe insurgents raised the white Taliban banner over the central city square and freed hundreds of fellow militants from the local jail, in a major embarrassment for Afghan forces who abandoned a provincial headquarters for the first time.\n\nThe stunning assault came a day before President Ashraf Ghani's unity government marked its first anniversary.\n\nIt was the second time this year that the hardline Islamist movement has besieged Kunduz city, defended by Afghan forces battling largely without NATO's support after it withdrew most of its troops last year. \n\nThe insurgents launched a surprise, three-pronged offensive before dawn, and by evening they had captured the governor's compound and provincial police headquarters, said Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesman for the hardline Islamist movement.\n\n\"Our fighters are now advancing towards the airport,\" Mujahid said on his Twitter account.\n\nA senior government official in Kabul confirmed that the provincial headquarters had fallen and Afghan forces were regrouping at the airport.\n\nDozens of Afghan special forces have been flown into Kunduz airport on a C-130 aircraft and were preparing to launch a counter-attack, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"IT LOOKS GRIM\"\n\nThe Kunduz assault marks a troubling development in the insurgency, although Afghan forces have managed to drive the Taliban back from most of the territory they have gained this year during an escalation in violence.\n\n\"It is certainly the first major breach of a provincial capital since 2001,\" said Graeme Smith, senior analyst for International Crisis Group.\n\n\"They are choking the Afghan forces from all sides. It looks pretty grim.\"\n\nThe United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan evacuated its Kunduz compound on Monday morning, soon after the assault began.\n\n\"They've been relocated within Afghanistan,\" said U.N. spokesman Dominic Medley, declining to say where or how many staff were evacuated.\n\nAbdullah Danishy, deputy governor of Kunduz, vowed that Afghan forces would retake the occupied city.\n\n\"We have reinforcements coming from other areas and will beat back the Taliban,\" Danishy said by telephone from Kunduz airport after fleeing his office.\n\nBut with much of downtown Kunduz now in Taliban hands and terrified civilians either trying to flee or hiding inside their homes, the insurgents may be tough to dislodge.\n\n\"Once they get inside an urban area, your air assets and artillery become much less useful,\" Smith said.\n\nFAMILIES SEPARATED\n\nThe Taliban were ousted in 2001 after a U.S.-led campaign, and have been fighting to reimpose their rule in sporadic clashes ever since. They have stepped up their offensive this year as NATO forces drew down to just a few thousand troops.\n\nOne Reuters witness saw buildings on fire in the south of the city and Taliban fighters entering a 200-bed government-run hospital.\n\nDozens of panicked residents fled to the city's main airport but were turned away by security forces. \n\nElectricity and phone services were cut across most of the city, and family members struggled to locate one another in the chaos.\n\n\"My uncle's wife has been killed by the Taliban today and still my wife and kids are in the area that the Taliban captured, so it is important to free my family,\" said Matin Safraz, an official at the interior ministry who was visiting Kunduz for the Muslim holiday of Eid.\n\nSafraz had retreated to the airport, and said he was prepared to fight the Taliban with a borrowed AK-47 rifle.\n\nSayed Sarwar Hussaini, a spokesman for Kunduz police, said \n\n20 Taliban fighters had been killed and three Afghan police wounded in the early morning clashes. Updated casualty figures were not immediately available.\n\nAccording to two security officials, Taliban gunmen, some armed with rocket-propelled grenades, overwhelmed security guards and broke into the main city prison, freeing hundreds of fighters.\n\nTaliban spokesman Mujahid urged Kunduz residents to stay inside.\n\n\"The mujahideen are trying to avoid any harm to Kunduz residents,\" he said on his official Twitter account, referring to Taliban fighters.\n\nThe once-quiet north of Afghanistan has seen escalating violence in recent years. Kunduz city was the centre of fierce fighting in April as the Taliban sought to gain territory after the end of NATO's combat mission at the end of 2014.\n\nA scaled-down NATO presence now mostly trains and advises Afghan forces, although U.S. drones still target militant leaders and a U.S. counter-terrorist force also operates in the country.\n\n(Additional reporting by Mirwais Harooni, Jessica Donati, Hamid Shalizi.; Writing by Kay Johnson; Editing by Mike Collett-White, Nick Macfie, Robert Birsel)","title":"Afghan Taliban seize northern city centre in major attack","media-type":"News","source":"Yahoo!

{"id":"41d0959b-ba60-4f93-86c2-b86e644719c4","content":"In the 1st inning on Monday night, the Mets loaded the bases with nobody out. Perhaps two weeks ago an extended rally was certain, particularly with the team facing the completely moribund Braves. Now that the air has seemingly been let out of the Mets, it didn't seem like such a guaranteed proposition. Lucas Duda popped out for the first out. Travis d'Arnaud followed by hitting what looked like a sure Double Play ball right to Adonis Garcia at 3rd. I groaned, because at least that's what I figured would be the case. But Yoenis Cespedes slid hard into 2nd and took Daniel Castro out of the play, allowing d'Arnaud to reach and Curtis Granderson to score.\nLost in this play was Daniel Murphy, who had been running from 2nd to 3rd on the play and pulled up to try to avoid getting tagged out. However, Murphy then apparently decided he'd had enough of this and turned towards second to watch the play, as opposed to doing his job and continuing to run to 3rd. By time it dawned on him that he probably should have done that, it was unfortunately too late as Garcia threw back to Overratedton Simmons and Murphy was tagged out to end the inning, a rather odd but perfectly Murphian 5-4-6 Double Play.\nIn the 3rd inning, Jon Niese, who by this point had retired the first 8 Braves to face him, all on ground balls, walked Shelby Miller, the opposing pitcher. This was bad enough, but Shelby Miller, hitting .059 on the season is clearly a lousy hitter even for a pitcher. Michael Bourn followed by hitting a clean single through the right side. Castro followed by grounding to short, but Wilmer Flores' throw was a little wide and pulled Lucas Duda off the base at 1st and Castro was aboard on the error. By now, you probably had a good sense of where this was heading. Niese has made a career out of letting these minor irritants snowball into full-blown bloodbaths. This season, it's probably happened to him every other time he's taken the mound. Freddie Freeman, who was due for a good Met-killing moment, was coming to the plate. Everything was once again about to go haywire.\nBut it didn't. Freeman hit a rope to center that kind of knuckled a little bit, but Cespedes caught the ball and the Braves were turned away.\nThe Mets, in addition to their ill-gotten 1st inning run, had every opportunity to run Shelby Miller out of the building. Michael Conforto hit a Home Run in the 2nd inning, another opposite-field shot, as his power display continues to impress. Miller then came about as close to completely unraveling as you can, but the Mets ultimately let him off the hook. He walked Niese, walked Granderson and was honing in on 60 pitches in the 2nd inning. For Miller, a good pitcher, this season must be so demoralizing. He hasn't won a game in what, 22 straight starts? Somehow, he sucked it up and got through 6 innings, which is a credit to him.\nSo, Niese survived his attack of himself and managed to make it through 6 innings, although I think he may have been pre-emptively removed as he'd only thrown 87 pitches. Then again, with Niese, you try not to press your luck. Addison Reed threw a clean 7th inning. The Mets doubled their lead when Murphy double home 2 runs and remembered to keep running until he reached his intended base. Tyler Clippard returned to the mound with a mostly uneventful 8th inning (if you consider a hit and two Wild Pitches uneventful) and Jeurys Familia, though not in a Save situation, closed out a sanity-saving 4-0 victory.\nThis was my 20th game of the season at Citi Field, a lofty number that I haven't reached since 1999, and for those 20 games, this is the 13th the Mets have won. There becomes less and less to say about these games as the days wind down because basically, either the Mets win or the game stunk. Fortunately, the Mets won. The crowd seemed partially into things, which was OK. Last Monday, the game I was at was basically amateur hour because I found myself sitting around people that weren't paying attention to the game altogether. There were also about 12,000 fans there and this was a relevant team playing a relevant game. Of course, last week, the Mets were playing the irrelevant Marlins. Last night, the crowd was a bit heartier, even though they were playing the equally irrelevant Braves. I wonder if the fans are finally starting to develop a bit of a sense of urgency here. Lord knows the Mets could use the extra energy.","title":"That's Much Better","media-type":"Blog","source":"The Ballclub","published":"2015-09-23T04:00:11Z"}

While a classic carrot cake can be delicious, it isn\u2019t the only way to bring carrots into your baked goods. These Whole Grain Harvest Carrot Muffins are a fantastic way to incorporate some carrots into your daily baking this season \u2013 no frosting required. \n \nThese muffins start with a blend of regular all purpose and whole wheat flours. I avoided using all whole wheat flour because I did not want the muffins to feel to heavy or dense, and using a blend of flours gives them a much lighter texture. You can also use white whole wheat flour for both of the flours for a very similar result. The muffins are sweetened with brown sugar and a generous amount of spice before carrots are shredded up and stirred in to the batter. In these muffins, you can use regular orange carrots or rainbow carrots , which will add some flecks of color into the crumb of the muffins. After baking, the muffins are moist and tender, with some great spiciness a hint of nuttiness from the whole wheat flour blending into the sweet flavors of carrot and molasses (from the brown sugar). You\u2019ll want to warm them up and serve them alongside a steaming mug of coffee on a cool morning, while you watch the colors of the leaves change. \n \nThese muffins have an excellent flavor on their own, and I typically serve them as-is or with a side of whipped cream cheese. If you want to add a little more texture to your muffins, stir in half a cup of raisins or half a cup of chopped, toasted pecans. Both ingredients will add a bit of extra flavor to the muffins and are nice variations to have in your back pocket. The muffins are ready-to-eat on the day they are baked, however they will keep well for 1-2 days after baking when stored in an airtight container. \n \n\n \n \nWhole Wheat Harvest Carrot Muffins \n3\/4 cup all purpose flour \n3\/4 cup whole wheat flour \n1 tsp baking soda \n1 tsp ground cinnamon \n1\/4 tsp ground cloves \n1\/4 tsp freshly ground nutmeg \n1\/4 tsp salt \n1\/4 cup vegetable oil \n1 cup brown sugar \n1 large egg \n1 1\/2 cups shredded carrots (2-3 medium carrots) \n1\/2 cup buttermilk \noptional: 1\/2 cup raisins or chopped, toasted nuts \n \nPreheat oven to 375F.

{"id":"725abfbe-5cdf-45f5-aa87-a9ccb85743ec","content":"Anheuser-Busch InBev NV said Wednesday that it is buying Los Angeles-based brewery Golden Road Brewing, the beer giant's latest effort to tap into the growing demand for craft beers. \n\nTerms of the deal weren't disclosed. AB InBev, the world's largest beer company with brands like Budweiser and Bud Light, has made a concerted push over the last several years to catch up with American consumers, who increasingly are trading mild-flavored lagers like Bud Light for more flavorful India Pale Ales and porters made by craft breweries. \n\nGolden Road road is the largest craft brewery in Los Angeles. Its beers include Point the Way IPA, Wolf Among Weeds IPA, Golden Road Hefeweizen and a collection of seasonal brews. The company, which sells both canned and draft beers, expects to sell 45,000 barrels of beer this year. \n\nThe acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of the year. \n\nThe deal is AB InBev's fifth craft-brewery acquisition since 2011. AB InBev bought its first craft brewer in 2011, paying $38.8 million for Chicago-based Goose Island. It has also picked up Patchogue, N.Y.-based Blue Point Brewing Co., Bend, Ore.-based 10 Barrel, and Seattle-based Elysian Brewing Co. \n\nThe Golden Road acquisition will give AB InBev a foothold in the growing Los Angeles craft beer market. Golden Road sold approximately 45,000 barrels of beer in 2015. Recent brewery acquisitions have priced craft brewers at more than $1,000 a barrel. Craft's share of the U.S. beer market has more than doubled over the past decade to 9%, while share for mainstream beers like Budweiser and Miller Lite have fallen to 77% from 86%, according to industry tracker Beer Marketer's Insights. Imported beer makes up the rest of the market. \n\nThe Golden Road deal is the third craft deal this month. MillerCoors LLC, a joint venture between SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Co., recently announced a deal for San Diego-based Saint Archer. Dutch Brewer Heineken NV said earlier this month it took a 50% stake in Lagunitas Brewing, the sixth-largest independent brewer in the U.S. \n\nThe deal comes as AB InBev pursues beverage-maker SABMiller PLC, a bold move that, if successful, would create a brewing giant that would dominate much of the global beer market. \n\nA deal would allow the new beer behemoth to take big mainstream brands like Budweiser and Stella Artois, which have been languishing in key markets, into new corners of the globe. The deal could also help the two brewers resist the growing popularity of craft beers. \n\nSABMiller has said that its board \"will review and respond as appropriate to any proposal which might be made.\" \n\nWrite to Chelsey Dulaney at Chelsey.Dulaney@wsj.com and Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com Access Investor Kit for \"AB InBev\"\n\nVisit http:\/\/www.companyspotlight.com\/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=BE0003793107\n\nAccess Investor Kit for \"AB InBev\"\n\nVisit http:\/\/www.companyspotlight.com\/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US03524A1088\n\nSubscribe to WSJ: http:\/\/online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 23, 2015 13:45 ET (17:45 GMT)","title":"Anheuser-Busch to Buy Craft Brewer","media-type":"News","source":"ADVFN UK","published":"2015-09-23T18:05:13Z"}

{"id":"77945c77-4035-4913-bd85-63449267fb2e","content":"Boston News.Net  Monday 21st September, 2015  \n  WASHINGTON - Landfill disposal rates in the US at 262 million tonnes a year in 2012 is more than double what has been estimated by the federal Environmental Protection Agency, according to a study by three US environmental scientists. \nThe study report published Monday in Nature Climate Change, states that the volume of waste in landfills, a major source of the potent greenhouse gas methane, was grossly underestimated in the United States in 2012. \n \nLandfill disposal of municipal solid waste represents one of the largest anthropogenic global methane emission sources. Recent policy approaches have targeted significant reduction of these emissions to combat climate change in the US. \n \nThe study found that as against 122 million tons of garbage estimated to have been dumped in 2012 by the EPA, there was around 262 million tons of garbage dumped in landfills that year, the environmental scientists wrote. \n \n\"This suggested that methane emissions, from the decomposition of municipal waste at these dumps, was also undercounted,\" the report states. \n \nThe scientists claimed to have used a different methodology which was the \"most accurate for the US so far\" than the EPA. \n \nThe efficacy of active gas collection systems in the US was also examined by the scientists by analyzing performance data, including fire occurrence, from more than 850 landfills. \n \nThe study's primary goal was to learn more about the efficiency of methane capture systems at landfills, which are more effective after a landfill stops accepting new waste, said study co-author Jon T. Powell, a Yale doctoral student. \n \n\"When a landfill reaches the end of its life, an engineered cap or barrier system is installed to seal off the waste material from the environment,\" Powell said. \n \n\"Open landfills typically have some areas that are 'closed' in this manner, but also have areas that do not have permanent caps, and it is more difficult to extract methane and other gases that are generated in these areas.\" \n \nThe study found that gas collection systems at closed landfills were significantly more efficient and on average 17 percentage points more efficient than those at open landfills, but open landfills were found to represent 91 percent of all landfill methane emissions. \"These results demonstrate the clear need to target open landfills to achieve significant near-term methane emission reductions,\" states the report. \n \nLandfills represent the third-largest, man-made source of methane in the United States -- about 18 percent of domestic emissions, according to the report. \n \nMethane lives for a shorter time in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), the most abundant greenhouse gas (GHG), but traps far more of the heat radiated from Earth's surface. \n \nThe scientists calculated that the average rate of landfill waste disposal was increasing at a rate of about 0.3 percent per year. \n \nThe underestimation of the waste disposal and the emission in the United States has raised the spectre of similar miscalculations in the rest of the world. \n \n\"A high reliance on land filling has been observed in the EU (European Union) and in developing nations, similar to the US,\" wrote the researchers. \n \n\"Improving the collection of LFG at open landfills, must be a target for policymakers, researchers and practitioners to achieve near-term GHG emission reductions in the waste sector.\"","title":"GHG emission from US landfills underestimated, finds new report","media-type":"News","source":"BostonNews.Net","published":"2015-09-21T23:59:56Z"}

With very simple mathematics. \n\nMore public service newsDHS wage showdown loomsTax Office offers front-loaded pay deal\n\nThe federal government's largest department, Human Services, is battling to win the hearts and minds of its 34,000 public servants before they begin voting Friday on a new wage offer.\n\nWorkers at the giant department are being told that 1.5 per cent pay offer is better than a 0.00 per cent pay offer as management hammers its message with a \"get the facts\" poster blitz.\n\nPublic servants at DHS sites around Australia arrived at work on Thursday to be confronted with \"Vote-Yes\" screensavers on their computers as management pull out all the stops ahead of the poll.\n\nMeantime at the Australian Taxation Office, bosses are battling just to get a ballot up and running as unions take their grievances with the process to the industrial umpire.\n\nCampaigning at DHS is reaching fever pitch with the department's senior management and their adversaries in the Community and Public Sector Union blitzing Centrelink, Medicare and Child Support Agency workplaces around the nation with their campaign posters.\n\nBetter than nothing? tell us what you think at ps@canberratimes.com.au\n\nSenior management at the department want to see an end to the troubled bargaining process which has been dogging the department since early 2014 but are up against a determined CPSU effort in the most heavily unionised federal department.\n\nThe boss's message urges public servants to \"get the facts\", arguing their offer of 1.5 per cent over three years is the \"best pay offer around\".\n\n\"1.5% is better than 00.0%, that's a fact!\" the poster declares.\n\n\"Low pay offer? It's the best pay offer around and that's a fact too!\"\n\nIn its response, the CPSU is using the image of public service minister Eric Abetz who the union believes is one of its best assets as it works for the large no-vote it needs to maintain the momentum for its campaign against the Abbott government's public sector wage policies.\n\nOne poster depicts the minister pushing down on rights, conditions, wages and jobs while another highlights the improvements to the offer that have already been made in the face of the wholesale rejection of earlier proposals.\n\nVoting begins on Friday and ends on Thursday, September 10.\n\nMeantime at the Australian Taxation Office, unions have applied to the Fair Work Commission for \"bargaining orders\" forcing Tax Office bosses to disclose more information before a vote on their wage offer is held.\n\nSenior management are keen to hold a ballot of their 18,000 public servants . But the Australian Services Union, backed by the CPSU, says it needs to know more about Commissioner Jordan's plans for productivity improvements and cost savings between this financial year and 2018-2019.\n\nBut the ATO's human resources boss Geoff Leeper say he wants to go to a ballot as soon as possible.\n\n\"We think that is fair and reasonable after more than 12 months of negotiations,\" Mr Leeper told workers on Wednesday.\n\nThe ATO is seeking a fast-tracked resolution to the dispute from the FWC.

{"id":"0c78625e-4eca-4f46-ad11-45f85ea1e7f9","content":"Old River Baptist Church on FM 1409, just over the county line into Chambers County, held a dinner Saturday evening, Sept. 26, to hear from representatives of Operation Christmas Child. \n  \nAmong the representatives was Alex Nsengimana, a survivor of the tribal war and attempted genocide in Rwanda during the mid-1990s, whose life was brightened once as a 7-year-old orphan when he received a shoebox filled with school supplies, candy and other items sent to his orphanage from Operation Christmas Child. It was the first present he had ever gotten. \n \nPastor Mark Brumbelow of tiny Grace Baptist Church in Brazoria, Texas, also spoke Saturday evening. He described the success his 25 to 30-member congregation has had over the past 10 years packing and shipping shoeboxes full of the things small children might want or need. With the local CATO store saving boxes for them, his congregation filled 43 shoeboxes in 2013. The next year, believing the Almighty was leading him to do so, Brumbelow set for his church the goal of filling and shipping 500 shoeboxes in 2014. He said they exceeded their goal and shipped 536 boxes last year. Shipping costs $7 per box, so $3,500 were needed to ship 500 boxes, but as collection week neared and money was short, Brumbelow said, unexpected donations came in, including a $1,000 donation from a visitor to his church. \n \nBrumbelow said his church\u2019s goal for this year is to pack and ship 2,000 shoeboxes, and they have 1,004 boxes packed so far. \n \nNsengimana began his speech by saying that while telling his story, he did not want the audience to hear it as only his story. \u201cI pray that you can see yourself in it,\u201d he told the audience, and see what God can do in their lives. \n \n\u201cI was born and raised in a very tiny little country called Rwanda,\u201d he said, \u201cYou can fit maybe 20 Rwanda in Texas, that\u2019s how small it is.\u201d \n \n\u201cIn the 1800s we were colonized by Belgium and Germany. While we were colonized they divided Rwanda into three tribes\u201d\u2014 the Tutsi, the Hutu, and the Twa. \n \nA revolutionary movement took place in 1959 and many members of Nsengimana\u2019s tribe, the Tutsi, fled the country that was afterwards dominated by the Hutu majority. \n \nCivil war erupted several times, most recently in 1990, and in 1994 the Hutu controlled army and militia attempted to exterminate the Tutsi. \n \n\u201cAs a little boy I was raised by my grandmother who would take me to church, and I loved her very much,\u201d Nsengimana said. \u201cMy family was part of the Tutsi tribe, and through the years my grandmother faced a lot of hostility.\u201d \n \nWhen Nsengimana was then 6 years old, he said the militia came to his village on April 17, 1994 and killed his grandmother. He and his brother were taken in by an aunt and uncle, but the militia returned later searching for his uncle. \n \nAfter this he was cared for by another aunt and uncle in the city, but shortly after the war his uncle passed away and his aunt also became ill. Unable to care for him and his brother, Nsengimana\u2019s aunt placed them in a crowded orphanage, and it was there that he received the package from Operation Christmas Child. \n \nAmong the miracles Nsengimana said he experienced as a small child, he described a gunman\u2019s magazine dropping out of his rifle just before he would have fired on Nsengimana and other children. He also described running from gunfire and slipping on a cow pie and falling just as he heard a bullet whiz over his head. \n \nLater, as a teenager Nsengimana had the opportunity to come to the United States, and while attending high school in the U.S. became involved with Operation Christmas Child. \n \nOperation Christmas Child is a project of Samaritan\u2019s Purse, and according to information provided by them, Samaritan\u2019s Purse \u201cis a nondenominational evangelical Christian organization providing spiritual and physical aid to hurting people around the world\u201d that has operated since 1970. Operation Christmas Child asks volunteers pack each shoebox with one nice toy \u2014 such as a doll, a stuffed animal or a soccer ball (with pump) \u2014 along with other toys, hygiene items and school supplies. Boxes are collected in mid-November to be delivered by Christmas. \n \nFranklin Graham, son of Billy Graham, is chairman of the board, president and CEO of Samaritan\u2019s Purse.","title":"Rwandan survivor promotes Operation Christmas Child at Old River Baptist Church","media-type":"News","source":"Cleveland Advocate","published":"2015-09-28T18:48:37Z"}

The news was first reported by The Des Moines Register. \n \n\"What we've looked at and come around to is similar thoughts as in 2011,\" said Bruce Rastetter, a major GOP donor who made his fortune in the pork and ethanol industries. \"We need blunt, bold leadership. We need somebody that can actually govern.\" \n \nOf the seven who hopped aboard the private plane to the East coast in 2011, two have long been vocal supporters and one has said he would not endorse because he works for an elected official. Getting the majority to publicly endorse Christie is a boon for his campaign. He has struggled to compete in a crowded field that includes attention-grabbing front-runner Donald Trump. \n \n\"Whatever he needs, we're going to be behind him,\" said real estate developer Gary Kirke, who said the group wanted to stick together. \n \nHis backers think his chances are improving after strong debate performances and with two governors \u2014 Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry \u2014now out of the race. Now Rastetter said he hopes the endorsements will send a message to Iowa Republicans, that they should \"give him another look.\" \n \nChristie held a town hall meeting with Rastetter Monday night, telling the crowd gathered in a cavernous barn that \"you'll always know how hard I'm willing to fight for you.\" He declined to talk about the endorsements in advance of the Tuesday press conference. \n \nThe trip this week marks his ninth to the leadoff caucus state this year. Christie, who has focused more heavily on New Hampshire, has spent less time here than many other contenders, though he put in a marathon day at the Iowa State Fair in August and has a well-regarded team, with respected operatives Phil Valenziano and Jeffrey Boeyink. \n \nCampaign aides said Christie will be ramping up his visits to the state in the fall. Mikel Derby, who works for the state's transportation department and who was part of the Christie recruitment effort in 2011, said there is still time for Christie to do well. \n \n\"History is littered with the Bachmanns and Walkers who are superstars real early. There's no purpose in peaking in August and September,\" said Derby, who has been with Christie all along. \n \nStill, while these endorsements matter, most agree Christie will still have to invest more time in Iowa. Republican State Rep. Chip Baltimore, who has not endorsed a candidate, said there was no substitute for retail politicking. \n \n\"If he is not here, he will not do well,\" Baltimore said. \"Gov. Christie, when he talks to people and meets people, is very persuasive. People walk away from that generally feeling positive toward him.\"","title":"Iowans who sought to draft Christie in 2011 are with him for 2016","media-type":"News","source":"Minneapolis Star Tribune","published":"2015-09-29T04:05:15Z"}

{"id":"d8ec5d11-bf4d-4464-8dc7-c0984563181b","content":"FOX LAKE, Ill. \u2014 Authorities broadened the hunt Wednesday for three suspects wanted in the fatal shooting of a popular Illinois police officer, even as they acknowledged that they had no indication the men were still in the area where the slaying happened. \n \nAfter an intensive 14-hour \u201cgrid search\u201d of homes, railroad tracks and marshland in the village of Fox Lake, the second-day manhunt turned to the painstaking detective work of chasing down tips, collecting and reviewing surveillance video and interviewing residents near the crime scene. Meanwhile, new search teams rippled out into subdivisions beyond the initial 2-square-mile perimeter established on Tuesday. At least 100 investigators were on the ground. \n \nA major challenge was the lack of a description of the suspects beyond the vague one that came from the officer, who told dispatchers he was pursuing three suspicious men \u2014 two white, one black \u2014 moments before he was shot. \n \n\u201cThat was the only description provided,\u201d said Lake County Major Crimes Task Force Cmdr. George Filenko, the lead investigator on the case. \u201cSo of course we\u2019re getting the public calling in every time they see that match of three individuals or even two individuals. We\u2019ve closed out those leads completely as being unsubstantiated.\u201d \n \nLt. Charles Joseph Gliniewicz, a 30-year police veteran, was shot Tuesday morning while pursuing the men he spotted on his way to work, Filenko said. Gliniewicz told dispatchers the three ran into a swampy area, and he requested a second unit. \n \nDispatchers soon lost contact with him. Backup officers found him about 50 yards from his squad car with a gunshot wound. He died soon after. \n \nFilenko said there was no indication he was intentionally targeted, though authorities did not rule out that possibility. \n \nThe initial, frenzied search for his killers involved law enforcement agencies from across the state. Some wore tactical gear and toted high-powered rifles. Officers took up positions on rooftops and along railroad tracks and scanned the terrain through rifle scopes and binoculars. Others leaned out of helicopters with weapons at the ready. \n \nOn Tuesday night, they declared the initial search zone clear, allowing investigators to begin poring over the crime scene and surrounding area. \n \nStill, they knocked on doors with caution. \n \n\u201cI believe that the search teams did a thorough job, but I know there have been a number of national incidents where suspects have cleverly escaped or hidden in place,\u201d Filenko said. \u201cSo anything\u2019s possible.\u201d \n \nInvestigators were reviewing video recordings, but so far none has captured images of the suspects, Filenko said. \n \nDespite the challenges, he told reporters that he felt the teams were making progress. \n \n\u201cAs always, we\u2019re relying on the public, too,\u201d he said. \u201cAll it takes is one tip or good lead to break a case wide open.\u201d \n \nResidents of the usually sleepy community were urged to stay vigilant. Schools that went on lockdown the day of the shooting were closed a day later. \n \nAn emotional Mayor Donny Schmit described the slain officer as a personal friend and a father of four sons. \n \n\u201cWe lost a family member,\u201d Schmit said of the 52-year-old officer known around town as \u201cG.I. Joe.\u201d \u201dHis commitment to the people of this community has been unmatched and will be dearly missed.\u201d \n \nWorkers adorned the village hall with black and purple bunting in a display of mourning. Several evening vigils were planned. \n \nEleven-year-old Takoa Thomas, a sixth grader, stood on the side of a road with a handmade sign that read \u201cCops\u2019 lives matter. RIP GI Joe.\u201d \n \n\u201cI wanted to be out here to show support,\u201d the boy said. \n \nHis mother, Tara England, 41, said the boy\u2019s school was closed, and she had mixed feelings about their safety. \n \n\u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m out here is I don\u2019t want to be home alone,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband\u2019s at work.\u201d \n \n\u201cBut if it were me, I\u2019d be long gone,\u201d she said of the suspects. \n \nThe area near the Wisconsin border area is popular for boating and other outdoor pursuits because of its forest preserves and a chain of lakes that partly encircles Fox Lake. \n \nGliniewicz\u2019s death is the third law enforcement fatality in Illinois this year, according to the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, which tracks officers\u2019 deaths so their names can be enshrined on a Washington, D.C., memorial. \n \nIt says police shooting deaths in the U.S. are down 13 percent this year compared with the same January-to-September period last year. There were 30 last year and 26 this year. \n \nAttorney General Loretta Lynch condemned the recent fatal shootings, telling a housing conference in Washington that violence against \u201call of us, regardless of what uniform any of us wear\u201d must end. \n \nLynch said it\u2019s a \u201csad fact now\u201d that no one is safe, citing shootings of churchgoers at a Bible study in Charleston, South Carolina, moviegoers in Louisiana, military personnel in Tennessee and two television journalists killed on the air last week in Virginia. \n  In Other News","title":"Hunt for 3 suspects widens after Illinois officer\u2019s death","media-type":"News","source":"San Francisco Examiner","published":"2015-09-03T02:21:10Z"}
{"id":"ef637742-6fff-4def-967c-86a5016e2a47","content":"When new federal regulations kick in this year to reduce power plant emissions, a statewide energy crisis could loom.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is calling for a 32 percent reduction by 2030. In order to get there, several coal plants across Michigan will begin to close this year.In all, nine plants are expected to close over the next two years, with nothing currently planned to replace the energy they produce.Two units at the Trenton Channel Power Plant are among those that will close, along with two more south of the Downriver area at the J.R. Whiting plant near Luna Pier.DTE spokeswoman Randi Berris told The News-Herald Newspapers last year that the decision to close the units was a direct result of the new EPA regulations.\u201cThe decision was made because of new federal emissions' regulations taking effect in the next few years, and because of DTE\u2019s focus on reducing customers' rates and maintaining competitive electric rates in the future,\" Berris said.The Wyandotte Municipal Power Plant uses a combination of ways to generate power, coal burning among them. The plant wasn\u2019t on a shutdown list provided by the state of Michigan.No one from the plant was available to talk by press time for this report.Seven of the plants are owned by Consumers Energy and generate more than 950 megawatts of electricity. Overall, more than 1.3 daily gigawatts of power will need to be replaced after the plants all close.That amount would be enough to run Detroit, Grand Rapids and Lansing each day.Consumers Energy officials said they're doing their best to stretch resources to provide electricity to the state\u2019s residents. Those efforts include reopening a Dearborn power plant and the $155 million purchase of the Juniper power plant in Jackson.\"You can't store electricity, so it's important to try and have a surplus of it,\" John Russell, president and CEO of Jackson-based Consumers Energy, said in a statement. \"When customers hit the switch, they're either going to have it or they're not.\"Both political parties in the state have ideas on how to change regulations to help figure out the looming crisis.The GOP plan recently was released by Sen. Mike Nofs (R-Battle Creek), who chairs the state Senate Energy and Technology Committee.\u201cThis legislation represents hundreds of hours\u2019 worth of research, discussion and input from numerous individuals, groups and organizations, including the governor, committee members and the 37-member workgroup I appointed last year,\u201d Nofs said. \u201cThese bills represent a starting point for a thorough committee process that will ultimately help us craft the best policy to respond to a rapidly changing landscape for energy.\u201dThe Democrats' side is spearheaded by state Rep. Bill Lavoy (D-Monroe) and state Sen. Hoon-Young Hopgood (D-Taylor).\u201cThrough 2014, renewable energy projects have brought nearly $3 billion in investment to Michigan, and utilities are on track to meet the 10 percent goal required in current law,\u201d LaVoy said. \u201cAs long as renewable energy remains economically viable, the percentage of power generation should increase. Additionally, increasing Michigan-based generation keeps jobs and investment in Michigan.\u201dState Sen. David Knezek (D-Dearborn Heights) and state Rep. Julie Plawecki (D-Dearborn Heights) also are working on the Democratic side of the aisle.The two plans are quite different.Nofs' plan calls for revamping the current integrated resource planning process to change the way utility companies are evaluated. The Republican plan hasn\u2019t been well publicized since it officially was unveiled July 1.The Democratic plan has been on display and talked about since early March. It calls for an increase in support for clean energy-type businesses, with more focus on wind and solar energy companies.\u201cWe want to encourage companies to spend here in Michigan,\u201d Knezek said. \u201cRight now, there isn\u2019t anything that restricts out- of-state buying of power. We don\u2019t want that to remain unregulated.\u201dPlawecki echoed those thoughts. She said if Michigan encourages companies to produce energy within the state, it will increase jobs and ultimately help the local economy.Since Michigan passed a renewable energy bill in 2008, more than $5 billion a year have been pumped into the state economy. About $3 billion of that has been invested by private-sector firms.Small-business owners claim the GOP plan for energy production moving forward will put a stop to much of that growth.\u201cThe Nofs' plan slams the brakes on Michigan\u2019s clean energy sector, which has been a huge success, supporting 20,500 jobs and $5 billion in annual economic activity,\u201d Mark Cryderman, business development\/education manager of the Green Panel, said in a statement. \u201cPolling consistently shows overwhelming support for increasing Michigan\u2019s use of clean energy and the Michigan Legislature should be increasing our clean energy standards, not repealing them.\u201dThe Green Panel is a Brighton-based solar company that employs 30 people.State Rep. Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Twp.), who co-authored much of the GOP plan, is against the changes at the federal level, but said he believes its plan is the best bet for the state.\u201cThe mandate that is being forced upon Michigan and the rest of the states by the federal government is an unprecedented overreach that will hinder job growth and raise energy rates on hardworking taxpayers,\" Nesbitt said in a statement. \u201cWe need an energy plan for the future that ensures reliability and efficiency, while being cost-effective for Michigan families.\u201cThe energy proposal I unveiled earlier this year is structured to take an \u2018all of the above\u2019 approach that considers each of those elements, rather than a narrow, cookie-cutter approach that picks winners and losers.\u201dHopgood believes the Democrats' plan is the way to go, both for clean energy and economic growth in the state.\u201cThis plan is pro-business, pro-consumer and pro-environment,\" he said. \"Michigan has the potential to be a leader in renewable energy and create thousands of jobs for hardworking men and women across the state. That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial that we act this year. With these energy principles, my Democratic colleagues and I are ready to get to work.\u201dThere is overwhelming public support for increasing renewable energy and energy efficiency, according to a poll conducted by the Michigan Conservative Energy Forum in late 2013. Among the findings, the poll showed that more than 75 percent strongly support an increased renewable portfolio standard and 84 percent support more energy efficiency programs. The support extended to self-identified conservative voters.\u201cWith such strong public support from both ends of the political spectrum, it\u2019s clear that this plan is the right way forward for Michigan\u2019s energy sector and our economy,\u201d LaVoy said. \u201cI look forward to working with my Republican colleagues to put these guidelines into action and create jobs while saving residents' money.\u201dAccording to a report from The Hill Group, a renewable portfolio standard increase would generate as much as $6 billion in economic activity and create tens of thousands of jobs. The Michigan Public Service Commission noted that in 2012 every dollar utilities spent on energy efficiency saved consumers an estimated $3.83 in reduced energy costs.","title":"Opinions differ on how to move forward with new energy regulations; residents could be left in the dark","media-type":"News","source":"Heritage News-Herald","published":"2015-08-14T20:53:52Z"}

New York City and Pensacola, FL, will test overnight truck deliveries in a new U.S. Department of Transportation pilot program to help reduce congestion on city streets. DOT believes that lighter commuter traffic and more available parking overnight will make delivery easier for truck drivers. DOT plans to use grants totaling $200,000 to test its theories in the two pilot cities. If the pilot is successful, DOT said it believes a similar approach could be adopted in other areas of the country. \n \n2. Paul Trombino III, Iowa DOT director, has been elected president of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the association announced. AASHTO also elected David Bernhardt, commission of Maine\u2019s DOT, as its vice president. According to AASHTO, Trombino plans to continue pursuing the association\u2019s policy priorities, including Congressional action on a new transportation bill. Trombino said his primary focus will be ensuring the association is well positioned to serve its member departments. \n \n3. USA Truck has appointed Martin Tewari as its president of trucking , Market Watch reports. Tewari will be responsible for the company\u2019s trucking operations, pricing and sales. He will report to the company\u2019s president and CEO Tom Glaser. According to the report, Tewari has more than 25 years of experience in the transportation industry and he joins USA Truck from Con-way Truckload, where he served as vice president of operations. \n \n4. According to a report in the American Journal of Transportation, Absolute Worldwide Logistics announced that it has acquired online trucking portal Shipmymachinery.com. The report states that the online portal provides transportation lead generation services relating to capital equipment and machinery to the transportation industry throughout North America. \n \n5. A group of rest stops in Indiana will be demolished and closed under The Indiana Toll Road\u2019s new plan for its 10 rest stops , according to NWI Times. According to the report, under a $30 million plan to upgrade rest stops, the easternmost stops in Steuben County will be eliminated and those in Rolling Prairie and Howe will be demolished and rebuilt into full-service travel plazas with gas stations, convenience stores and restaurants.

{"id":"2c04a5fc-b431-44b5-85a1-9ace3c5d00c7","content":"With almost a century of caps to his name, Sean Lamont is the old dog of Scottish rugby who believes he has learned enough tricks to keep on barking. \n \nBut the Glasgow Warrior insists he will be worried if he is not chased out of the side by one of the Dark Blues' young pups. \n \nThe 34-year-old made his 96th appearance for his country in Saturday's Test against Italy, scoring two tries in the 48-7 Murrayfield rout. \n \nIt was one step closer to that elusive third figure that will make him just the second Scot after Chris Paterson to have collected 100 caps. \n \nBut while some may view this year's World Cup in England as a perfect opportunity for Lamont to bow out on a high - especially coming just four months after lifting the first major honour of a 15-year professional career with Glasgow's Guinness PRO12 triumph - the Perth-born back insists he is not interested in exit strategies. \n \nIn fact, he even wryly joked about the prospect of playing on until the next tournament in Japan in four years' time. \n \nBut that is only if he is not hounded out by the young pretenders. \n \n\"I will never retire,\" said\u00a0Lamont. \"I've got a contract with Glasgow for next year, but I think I'll ask to go again once it ends. \n \n\"The desire is still there, the body is holding out and, provided I'm wanted, I will keep going. \n   Five classic Rugby World Cup Matches    \n\"So I have no plans to call it a day after this World Cup. Could I keep going until the next one in 2019? Well if I was still playing by then I'd be worried. \n \n\"I'd be asking myself, 'Where the hell are all the young wingers?' \n \n\"I'd be over the moon if I was still around this team by 2019, but I hope to God there is someone coming along to take my place. \n \n\"We've got the likes of Damien Hoyland, Rory Hughes and Dougie Fife coming through, so there are plenty of boys about. \n \n\"But I won't retire. Someone will retire me, but it won't be my decision.\" \n \nLamont has been to the last two World Cups but, while the tournament is the pinnacle for many, his memories are only filled with regret. \n \nIn 2007 the Scots looked set for a semi-final slot until Argentina robbed them of the chance. \n \nThe Pumas then roared louder again four years later as Andy Robinson's side failed to even make it out of their group. \n \nThe Scots are now gearing up for crucial clashes with Japan, America, South Africa and Samoa in Pool B, and Lamont wants his team to learn from the mistakes of the past. \n \nHe said: \"Both my previous World Cup experiences were a bit of a disappointment, if I'm being frankly honest. \n \n\"I loved going and it was great to be part of it. But in 2007 we blew the chance to make a semi-final, which would have been incredible. \n \n\"We should have beat Argentina in the quarters. We played all the rugby but didn't see out the win. That's why it was such a pain in the bum. \n \n\"Then last time around we didn't even make it out the group, which was disgraceful. \n \n\"The alarm bells were ringing in the first two games against Romania and Georgia when we struggled against both. We then had the Argentina game all but wrapped up and a 30-second lapse of concentration cost us the game. \n \n\"That left us having to beat a tough England side by 14 points, which was a big ask at any time, never mind in a World Cup. \n \n\"So I'm acutely aware of the fact that every pool game we play has got to be top notch. \n \n\"We can't just focus on South Africa in the third game as the important one. We're not that good. We're good, but just look at the defeat to Tonga in Aberdeen a couple of years ago. That could happen again if we don't go in with the right attitude.\"","title":"Scotland Rugby World Cup preview: Lamont\u2019s desire still burning strong","media-type":"News","source":"London Evening Standard","published":"2015-09-06T14:50:45Z"}

This compares to a deficit of 4.3 percent of GDP for the same period in 2014. \n \nThe total revenue and grants for the period was 11.2 percent of GDP, against a target of 10.6 percent of GDP. \n \nIn nominal terms, the outturn was 5.4 percent higher than target and 32.9 percent higher than the outturn for the same period in 2014. \n \nGhana\u2019s good performance in total revenue and grants was mainly due to a strong growth in domestic revenue. \n \nTax income \n \nTax revenue amounted to GH\u00a211,403.9 million, 8.4 percent higher than the Budget target of GH\u00a210,516.3 million. \n \nIn nominal terms tax revenue was 32.1 percent higher than the outturn recorded for the same period in 2014. \n \nThe strong performance in tax revenue was mainly due to the good performance of petroleum taxes, VAT and trade taxes resulting from the imposition of the Special Petroleum Tax and exchange rate depreciation as well as improved revenue administration and efficiency. \n \nGDP estimates for first half of 2015 \n \nTotal expenditure, including payments for the clearance of arrears for the first half of 2015 amounted to GH\u00a218,068.5 million (13.5 percent of GDP) against a target of GH\u00a218,805.7 million (equivalent to 14.0 percent of GDP). \n \nThe outturn was 3.9 percent lower than the budget target but 14.1 percent higher than the outturn for the same period in 2014. \n \nThe growth in expenditure was mainly due to higher spending on goods and services and foreign financed capital expenditure. \n \nThe cash fiscal deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP for the period under review was financed mainly from domestic sources, resulting in a Net Domestic Financing (NDF) of the budget of GH\u00a21. 875.4 million (1.4 percent of GDP). \n \nThe NDF for the period was 57.3 percent lower than the budget target of GH\u00a24,395.1 million and 48.6 percent lower than the outturn for the same period in 2014. \n \nForeign Financing of the budget was GH\u00a21,218.0 million representing 39.4 percent of total financing, against a target of GH\u00a2206.1 million. \n \nThus domestic financing constituted about 60.6 percent of the total financing of the deficit for the first six months of the year.","title":"Reduce your expenditure or face our wrath \u2013 government tells assemblies","media-type":"News","source":"Spy Ghana","published":"2015-09-07T15:04:13Z"}

The city of Dayton has requested that Maple Grove pass a resolution supporting the need and the application. \n\nStaff said, \u201cWith the number of high profile transportation projects underway the city of Maple Grove is fortunate to complete some of our highest priorities. One of our remaining projects, the extension of Hwy. 610, still seeks funding and could benefit from TED funds in the future. The Brockton Lane interchange does not appear to be in competition at this time.\u201d \n\nThere are plans for the extension of a sanitary sewer interceptor by the Metropolitan Council Environmental Services in the northwest corner of Maple Grove. This interceptor would serve the northern portion of Corcoran and the southern parts of Rogers and Dayton. \n\nThe Brockton Lane interchange would also provide a freeway access. \n\nOMNI BREWERY PATIO  \n\nAlso during the meeting, the council heard a request from OMNI Brewing Company to amend its current liquor license to include an outdoor patio area at its location at 9462 Deerwood Lane N. \n\nCity code states that an application for a proposed enlargement, alteration or extension of any premises previously licensed shall be provided to the city at least 60 days prior to the enlargement, alternation or extension taking place. \n\nSteve Hayes of OMNI Brewing said, \u201cWe thought of the idea of having a patio could wait until next year. As we near our opening day, we have been overwhelmed by the response we have received from the community and realize this \u2018wait until next year\u2019 approach isn\u2019t ideal.\u201d \n\nOMNI has food trucks scheduled to be on site every Friday and Saturday through the end of October. Hayes said a patio would help with crowd control as the interior space of OMNI would be unable to handle the excepted patrons. \n\nThe patio area would be contained by a fence. There would be signage in the patio area stating that alcohol containers are to remain in the patio area. The patio would have additional tables, seating, bathroom facilities and trash containers. \n\nThe council approved an amendment to OMNI Brewing Company to extend their current on-sale brewer\u2019s taproom\/Sunday sale and brewer off sale intoxicating- small brewer license to include alcohol service for an outdoor patio. \n\nPHOTOGRAPHY CONTEST  \n\nThe council also recognized the winners in the annual Maple Grove Moments Photography Contest. \n\nYouth Recognition category winners each received $50. Winners included: Katelyn Belden with the photo titled \u201cBeyond the Horizon,\u201d Kathryn Humnick with the entry \u201cSplashing into Summer,\u201d Brendan Kanwischer\u2019s submission \u201cSummer of Hoops,\u201d Leena Sebastin with the photo titled \u201cTree Silhouette\u201d and Brooke Willey\u2019s submission of \u201cFeed Me Momma.\u201d \n\nThe following winner were selected in each category with each first place receiving $100, second place $50 and third place $25. \n\nGoing Together included people.

{"id":"738c2ec8-5390-4c0c-b7c1-bd33389baafe","content":"DENVER (AP) \u2013 Tim Cullen smiled when he reckoned a one-day marijuana tax holiday in Colorado had probably saved him tens of thousands of dollars. \n \nCuilen, the owner of Colorado Harvest Co., a chain of marijuana dispensaries, was among the many growers and shoppers who benefited Wednesday from a quirk that required the state to suspend a 10 percent sales tax and a 15 percent wholesale excise tax for a day. \n \nWhile shoppers saved roughly $20 an ounce, or about 33 cents per joint, pot growers saved $300 a pound. \n \n\u201cI probably saved $45,000 before lunch,\u201d Cullen said. \n \nLooking over a small tangle of pot shoppers in his suburban Denver shop, Cullen said the crowds weren\u2019t huge but the tax break would be a big win anyway. \n \n\u201cThis is just gravy,\u201d Cullen said about the shoppers. \n \nRELATED STORIES: \u00a0 Marijuana Legalization Story Archive  \n \nThe odd tax waiver was triggered almost two years ago, when Colorado voters approved two taxes on recreational marijuana \u2013 a 10 percent sales tax for shoppers and a 15 percent excise tax for wholesale growers. \n \nAhead of that vote, state tax analysts miscalculated overall state revenue for 2014. The error triggered a mandatory suspension of the new pot taxes. \n \nLawmakers decided to waive the taxes only for a single day, though voters will have to return to polls in November to authorize the state to keep some $50 million in pot taxes collected in 2014. \n \nConfused? So were many shoppers Wednesday \u2013 but they loaded up on lower-cost weed anyway. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m just going to buy a little more than I normally do and hold onto it,\u201d said 41-year-old Tim Persoff. \n \n(credit: CBS) \n \nSome out-of-state visitors were shocked to see the virtually tax-free sale of weed. (It was still subject to local taxes and Colorado\u2019s basic 2.9 percent sales tax.) \n \n\u201cI saw online there was some kind of loophole on the taxes, so I had to come buy some,\u201d said David Illig of Onawa, Iowa, who was passing through on a drive to California. \n \nColorado tracks marijuana sales but doesn\u2019t make the data public, making it impossible to know if Wednesday set a single-day sales record. Several retailers said the day was akin to a busy holiday weekend. \n \nStill, shoppers and marijuana industry workers lauded the tax holiday as a needed break. \n \nIn a statewide tally made final Tuesday, Colorado reported that it collected much more in marijuana-specific taxes last fiscal year than alcohol-specific taxes. \n \n\u201cThe cannabis community has brought so much money to the state of Colorado, this is only fair,\u201d said Chad Drew, sales manager at Colorado Harvest Co. \n \n\u2013 By Kristen Wyatt, AP Writer \n \n(\u00a9 Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.

{"id":"1409d480-faed-45e9-99b4-ced536f80f1e","content":"No, the US is not Japan and the Federal Reserve is not the Bank of Japan. But when we assess the implications of what could be the first Fed rate after 7 years of zero interest rate policy in the US, there's no better reference than the BoJ.\nWhen Japan's asset bubble finally burst in 1990 and the nation was gripped in a deflationary spiral, the BoJ's easing policy took interest rates from 6.0% in 1991 to 0.50% in 1995. The central bank paused for three years as the global economy picked up and US demand powered ahead, until the Asian currency crisis hit the continent, forcing the BoJ to further slash rates, dragging the overnight rate to 0.25% in 1998 and 0% in 1999. Quantitative easing followed in 2001. 1st policy mistake In August 2000, satisfied with a modest recovery in inflation and prompted by the need to respond the global economic rebound as well as a series of Fed tightening, BoJ governor Masaru Hayami (known for his hawkishness and combative decisions against the cabinet) decided to raise rates by 25 bps. That proved to be the first policy error as the fallout from the dotcom bubble and the resulting recession in the US and in most of Europe accelerated Japan's deflationary crisis. Hayami was forced to ease again, slashing rates until they returned to 0.0% in early 2006. 2nd policy mistake. The 2nd and more publicized policy mistake occurred in late Q1 2006 as the BoJ, under governor Toshihiko Fukui, began withdrawing liquidity, which was created by raising excess reserves under the 5-year old quantitative easing policy. There were good reasons for reducing the extent of easing: Japan inflation was at 2-year highs, yen was at 3-year lows, the global economic recovery has entered its 2nd year, Fed had been raising rates for two years and even the European Central Bank had started tightening. But Fukui got carried away as the reduction of QE turned into higher rates. The overnight rate was raised back to 0.25% in July 2006 and to 0.50% in February 2007, then a nine-year high. As the global crisis imploded, the BoJ was forced to join all other central banks, dragging rates back to 0.1%. It may be disingenuous to call the BoJ's 2006 tightening a policy mistake as the dynamics prevailing at the time did justify such action. But the fact that the central bank not only quickly returned to zero rates, but also remained stuck in that phase well after other central banks partly withdrew their easing does highlight the structural deficiencies of Japan's savings\/deflation dynamics, which were only worsened by the 2006-7 rate hikes. PM Abe's 2012 decision to go for shock-&-awe policy and currency easing reflects the structural complexities of Japan's savings-deflationary deficiency. And still not much progress, with the exception of a weaker yen. Fed Hike would be another Mistake. Despite notable tightening in the US jobs market and improved state of most US balance sheets, a Fed rate hike today will be a policy mistake. Inflation continues to deviate away from the Fed's 2.0% target, lingering at a four-year low of 1.2%, from 1.4% in March and 1.7% in July 2014. This will be exacerbated by the disinflationary impact of USD strength, while inevitable depreciation of the Chinese yuan will continue to supress US inflation to the extent of shadowing declines in US jobless rate. The liquidity gaps in the US treasury market and the threat of further yields spikes at a time when the Federal government is nearing another debt ceiling deadline implies a potential break in the bond market and a blow for equity valuations, long dependent on low discount rates. Aside from China, Saudi Arabia, a key strategic partner of the US is already suffering from the combination of plunging oil prices, rising budget deficit and having its currency \u2013riyal-tied to a strong USD. The minutes of the July FOMC meeting have already revealed an admission of lower inflation and downside risks from China. Since that meeting, China devalued, oil fell further and inflation weakened (core PCE slowed to 1.24% from 1.30%). Raising rates now would be a grave error and the process of reversing it will trigger panic.","title":"Fed Must Avoid Bank Of Japan Errors","media-type":"Blog","source":"All Articles on Seeking Alpha","published":"2015-09-17T14:17:45Z"}

{"id":"70663f67-0d24-4b6b-9659-76367c3e8532","content":"By Daniel Noll \n \nEarlier this year, we collaborated with the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) on a three-part series entitled Travel as a Force for Good . In connection with its latest campaign we have been invited to explore what \u201cFreedom to Travel \u201d means to us.  As we did, we reaffirmed that the right to travel is not only important to us as individuals, but also to the communities we visit, and to the world and our shared humanity. Here\u2019s why. \n \n \n Small amidst the grandeur of the Simien Mountains, Ethiopia.   \nAfter having traveled together to over 90 countries during the last fifteen years, we are often asked,  \u201cWhat\u2019s the greatest lesson you\u2019ve learned?\u201d \n \nDeep breath. \n \nI feel as though my attempt to answer each time is never really up to the task of honoring the experience. The evidence stacks up almost too high, even for a single outing. My travels leave such deep imprints in and on me that I must on occasion deliberately take time to unpack those lessons, much as I might my luggage upon concluding a trip. \n \nNowadays, we have the opportunity to embark on journeys that were not too long ago unthinkable. The opportunities to explore the world \u2014 to feel and experience and comprehend it \u2014 are so vastly different and more broadly accessible than even just a generation or two ago. As modern transportation has placed us within a day or two of most of the world\u2019s destinations, we stand at a moment in the history of travel that speaks to a remarkable privilege \u2013 one that is almost too easy to take for granted. \n \nStill, our attention is captured, our sense of mystery engaged. Travel is thrilling. \n \nIf we look at it right, travel can be viewed as the ultimate act of appreciation. \n \nWhy? \n \nLike running one\u2019s hands through the soil of a robust garden at the harvest, travel is a vein of appreciation that seeks to know what\u2019s at the root of our existence, of our being human \u2014 together. \n Video: I Am Travel  \nA simple, yet powerful message: We should all have the right for travel freedom. What this beautiful video from WTTC that shows why. \n \n \n 24 Reasons Why the Freedom to Travel Matters  1. Enables us to better understand ourselves, our world, and our place in it.  \nNote: You can stop here if you like. The rest is \u201cthe how.\u201d \n 2. Helps transform our fears into curiosity.  \nTravel is the ideal laboratory to question and test all the assumptions that underlie your fears, so that you may emerge with new conclusions and evolve not only your thinking, but also who you believe you are. \n 3. Expands the boundaries of what you thought was possible \u2013 not only for you, but also for others.  \nTravel helps us press the edges of our perceived limitations, so that we may re-imagine them and continue to reach beyond. \n \n \n Travel. A Journey.   4. Spurs us all to be storytellers.  \nTravel provides a platform to tell your story and to hear the stories of others, then return home and tell a new story, a shared story. \n 5. Cultivates a sense of awe, curiosity, and respect.  \nIt does this in light of all the grandness and beauty, natural and man-made \u2014 around us, on the road\u2026and at home . \n \n \n Following a cheetah on his morning hunt in the Serengeti.   6. Reaffirms that in all of life\u2019s struggles, we are never alone.  \nTravel and you will realize that whatever physical, emotional, and financial challenges you face, there\u2019s someone halfway around the world that struggles similarly. \n 7. Evolves our perspective, helps us see things in a new way.  \nTravel not only shifts our thinking about the places we visit, but it can also help us carry back a spirit of innovation into our daily lives, personally and professionally. \n 8. Reveals the unexpected, if we open ourselves up for it.  \nFor as much as we all construct our itineraries, our innermost secret hope is that we will find something new, something we never could have planned. Travel often delivers. \n \n \n Clouds lift, revealing the stunning Karanfil Mountains, Albania.   9. Enables us to accumulate experiential wisdom .  \nIt\u2019s one thing to read about a place, it\u2019s another to walk its streets, eat its food, and engage with its people. Travel is among the most effective forms of experiential learning there is. \n 10. Develops humility. That is, humble-ness.  \nThe larger the world, the smaller your place in it. Fortunately, this re-sizing of self is also simultaneously paired with a sense of how great our individual impact on the lives of others can be. \n \n \n Get amongst it, New Zealand.   11. Allows us to let go , open up, and embrace uncertainty.  \nWhen everything around you is changing at pace, as it often the case on the road, sometimes the best choice \u2013 the only choice \u2014 is to accept it, to surrender to uncertainty, and simply be present amidst all that swirls around you. \n 12. Bends stereotypes to the point of breaking.  \nTravel helps unpack prevailing narratives about others and ourselves.  In TED parlance, travel can aid a departure from the \u201c single story \u201d, to many stories and multiple threads. \n \n \n Dancing breaks out at the market in Urgench, Turkmenistan.   13. Builds empathy .  \nTravel continually exposes you to people and contexts much different than your own. Listening to, understanding and connecting with the feelings, thoughts, and stories of others helps to strengthen your empathy muscle. \n 14. Helps bind us to our history, our arc.  \nThe experience of travel reinforces that although we may appear very different from one another, we often are working towards a common goal of making a life for ourselves and seeking a better life for those who will follow us long after we are gone.

Re-shapes \u201cother\u201d into \u201cus\u201d.  \nFear of another is easy, and frankly it\u2019s often understandable. Travel helps to swap that fear with memories of people you\u2019ve met in the flesh. When this happens countries are no longer shapes on a map or hotspots on the breaking news, but instead are places filled with stories of someone who invited you in for tea, wrote you a poem , guided you when you were lost, or helped you see life in a different light. \n \n \n Audrey adopted by a group of Turkmen women at a pilgrimage site.   16. Serves as a platform to explore adventure in all its dimensions.  \nWhether this is physical (e.g., climbing a mountain), emotional (doing something new that frightens you) or even psychological (re-imaging borders and barriers). \n 17. Cultivates your independence while revealing our greater interdependence.  \nWhether you travel solo, with your family or in a group, travel flexes the \u201cget out there\u201d independence muscle. At the same time, the experience of travel tells us that we need one another to get there and to enable those personal victories. \n 18.

Contributes significantly to economic growth and local job development.  \nIn 2014, the tourism industry was estimated at $  7.6 trillion (yes, you read that correctly) in annual revenue; it employed over 277 million people worldwide (Source: WTTC ). That represents almost 10% of total worldwide revenue, and 1 in 11 workers around the globe. Behind these staggering statistics, which are only expected to grow, are people : mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, all trying to make their way to better support their families. \n 21. Demonstrates that everyone has something valuable to share, something to give.  \nSometimes, it takes a visitor from the outside \u2013 wide eyes and all \u2013 to show us that what we sometimes take for granted in our daily lives is special, too.  Next time: watch someone making the local bread or tortillas. Travel can serve as a remarkable platform of cultural pride and self-esteem. \n \n \n Audrey attempts to make traditional Jordanian bread during a Zikra Initiative exchange .   22. Exposes our similarities, highlights our differences and reinforces our shared humanity.  \nTravel exposes us to others, others to us, and each of us to one another \u2013 and uncovers the diversity of being and experience that defines what it means to be human. \n 23. Catalyzes a feeling of inter-connectedness and greater community.  \nWhen we go outside our front door, we find that we are part of a local community. Similarly, when we travel, we find that we are members of a worldwide community. This awareness binds us to care and to take responsibility for our own \u2014 that is, the world\u2019s \u2014 well being. \n 24. Reinforces that the more we seek to understand each other, the less likely we are to turn on one another.  \nTravel may not ultimately deliver world peace, but it certainly can help. \n The Significance of Travel \u201cFreedom\u201d  \nSo yes, it strikes us that travel is powerful, impactful, remarkable. But what\u2019s so important about the \u201cfreedom\u201d part? \n \nNot everyone has the same freedom to travel. Audrey and I carry American passports , providing us with arguably some of the greatest flexibility of movement of any passport in the world. Without our privilege, we would not be able to do a lot of what we do, in the way that we do it. \n \nYet the freedom and right to travel can be restricted in various directions. \n \nSo what can we do? \n \nWe can act on whatever right we do have, and we can do so mindfully , pairing our freedom to travel with the responsibility to do so in a way that benefits everyone . We can help lay a foundation for others and make the case for a greater freedom to travel. \n \nTravel is the act of movement. As you take your next step, your journey moves forward, and so it will for others, and ultimately for our planet. \n \nNow it\u2019s your turn.

With thousands of treatment facilities in the country, it can be difficult to make a particular drug rehabilitation center stand out from the rest. Content marketing is \u201cthe strategy\u201d that can create critical visibility for the treatment facilities. \nWHY IS CONTENT KING? \n\nDrug and alcohol treatment is a highly personal process. Finding a treatment facility that the potential patient feels they can trust is a sensitive task. Having the right content on the treatment facility\u2019s website can help alleviate confusion and establish trust, rather than just having basic information about the facility such as location, phone number and services offered. Any facility can have a website; however, having a website that provides well-written information about treatment and addiction will give the reader insight When it comes to determining rank on search engines, Google loves to see relevant content from trusted sources drive traffic to a targeted site. \n   \nGoogle also loves to then see that traffic remain on your site. Consistently providing refreshing and relevant content will captivate a reader, not only encouraging them to go to your site but also keep them there. In the field of treatment, competition can be fierce. It is important to utilize content when demonstrating authority and pedigree in the field. In order to maintain a viable amount of patients, a treatment facility needs to have a good perception of all topics related to addiction and treatment. \n\nYour content can achieve even more authority when it is published by a highly trusted 3rd party source. Due to the fact that it can be difficult to constantly come up with new material for a website, having a professional writer create the content is most useful. Staying on top of developments in the treatment field will also make writing content easier. \n\nBlogs help make your content go viral and capture citations in the form of feedback and mentions. When the readers are actively talking about a topic, more keywords are being created, thus helping the treatment facility appear more often when those keywords are searched for. This creates more social authority and relevance for your content and ultimately boosts your website ranking. Any drug rehabilitation center can benefit from being talked about frequently. \n\nStaying fresh in reader\u2019s minds helps them to remember the facility when they decide to finally make the step towards treatment, or sending their loved one to treatment. In the end, content engages people and motivates them to act. Trusted publishing sources establishes pedigree, authority, drives traffic, and helps your website rank. Blogs will help your content go viral, capture citations, and help your page ranking. Having your name be seen continuously will only brand you and keep you relevant. \n\nDistributed by Client Initiative \n\nMedia Contact \nCompany Name: Client Initiatives \nContact Person: Stacy \nEmail:  support@clientinitiatives.com \nPhone: (888) 622-1282 \nAddress: 49690 Enterprise Cir.

Here's how we rated the individual efforts. \n \n Colin Slade 6.5  \n \nProficient positioning at the back. Joined backline when he could and produced a couple of sweet passes. Got 11 minutes at first-five at start of second half before being subbed. \n \n Nehe Milner-Skudder 8  \n \nA big step up from nervous opener against the Pumas. Two tries made him the official man of the match. Some good steps and busted first tackle every time. Sweet hands to gift Codie Taylor the last try. \n \n Malakai Fekitoa 6  \n \nA mixed effort. Couple of nice touches to keep the ball alive. Quiet night with his own running game but showed right instincts to stay on Sonny Bill Williams' shoulder for a good try. Guilty of falling off the tackle that gave Namibia their try. \n \n Sonny Bill Williams 8  \n \nCarried on where he left off with his exciting cup opener. Showed his distribution is more than just offloads with some good wide passes. But pop-pass for Fekitoa's\u00a0 try was sublime and produced a beautiful flick off the ground to keep movement alive for Skudder's second try. \n \n Julian Savea 7  \n \nConfidence-booster for the big wing who finally broke his 2015 test try drought with a brace. Wasn't given a lot of space out wide but went looking for work constantly and was a danger on the inside channel. Couple of drops under the high ball contributed to a sloppy second spell by the All Blacks. \n \n Beauden Barrett 6.5  \n \nCompetent control at No 10. Showed blistering speed and eye for gap for his try. Good line kicking but guilty of over-doing chip kicks at times. Goalkicking still a concern with five out of nine attempts. \n \n TJ Perenara 5  \n \nHad an armchair ride behind a dominant pack.

Set the tone with his opening try and his game has real momentum at the moment. \n \n Same Cane 7  \n \nHandled the captaincy well, vocal and imploring his side to keep some shape against a committed opponent who were determined to slow the game down. Plenty of continuity play. Held the leadership when Richie McCaw was introduced for final quarter. \n    \n Jerome Kaino 6.5  \n \nSolid as ever. Wasn't a night of huge tackle counts as All Blacks dominated position but Kaino made his hits count. Subbed for McCaw after 61 minutes. \n \n Sam Whitelock 6.5  \n \nGot an early lineout steal and was good at the restarts \u2013 an area of concern in the All Blacks game lately but one where they got plenty of practice. \n \n Luke Romano 7.5  \n \nStrong display with his physical approach. Asked to go the distance and was still firing at the finish. Couple of bruising runs and effective cleanout work at breakdown. \n \n Charlie Faumuina 6.5  \n \nA pleasing hour's work by the tighthead who has been short of rugby over recent months.

Those included Bridgeport, Conn.; Naples, Fla., New York; Miami, and Port St. Lucie, Fla. \n \nThe Wall Street Journal crunched Census data and came up with slightly different rankings . Still, Seattle didn\u2019t make the top 30 metropolitan areas in income inequality (nor the 30 least unequal, although Olympia did). \n \nThat doesn\u2019t mean all is well, of course. A new report from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics looks at the so-called 90-10 ratio. In other words, the ratio of the 90th percentile in income to the 10th percentile. Thus,\u00a0the best paid 10 percent of wage earners in the country (the 90th percentile) earned at least $88,330 annually, while the lowest paid 10 percent (the 10th percentile) earned less than $18,190. \n   \nThe data cover 2003 to 2013, and not surprisingly location, metro size and occupation concentration make a big difference. \n Most Read Stories Fatal crash involving stolen motorcycle snarls I-5 traffic Rare fish landed off Westport could be new state record Car strikes, kills toddler in stroller in Bellevue Seahawks 26, Bears 0: What the national media are saying Father of Marysville shooter convicted of gun charges Unlimited Digital Access.  $1 for 4 weeks. \nThe report states, \u201cLarger areas, especially in the Northeast and on the West Coast, typically have greater wage inequality, while smaller areas, many of which are in the South and Midwest, have less inequality. Metropolitan areas with high concentrations of employment in higher paying occupations also tend to have greater inequality.\u201d \n \nThe ratio for Seattle-Bellevue-Everett was 5.21 in 2013. That\u2019s significantly higher than the 4.86 for the United States as a whole. \n \nBut context matters: It\u2019s fairly modest for a tech center.

The last time I played for the Warriors, most of us were coming from off-season and that could have contributed to the jittery performance. However, I\u2019m not bitter at all that the coaches have overlooked me because I understand the coach (Callisto Pasuwa) has his plans and the guys called are capable of getting the country the much needed positive result. Hopefully, I\u2019ll be back in the national team and will continue working hard,\u201d said Nakamba. \n \nThe 21-year-old former Njube High School pupil said he would continue training at his base during the Fifa calendar weekend break. \n \nPasuwa named what appears on paper to be a strong side, but his preparations for weekend game against Guinea took off at a snail\u2019s pace as most foreign-based players are stuck at their bases waiting for Zifa to send them air tickets. \n \nMidfielders who will do duty this weekend include the South African-based trio of Willard Katsande, Khama Billiat and Kuda Mahachi. \n \nOf the three, only Mahachi, who was not registered by Mamelodi Sundowns, has not played competitive football in the last four weeks, but has only been training with the Chloorkop side. \n \nMahachi\u2019s stellar performance against South Africa last month in Pietermaritzburg during the Under-23 Caf Championships clash, could be the reason the ginger-haired midfielder was called up. \n \nDanish-based midfielder Quincy Antipas has been ruled out and replaced by Dynamos\u2019 Ronald Chitiyo. \n \nChicken Inn\u2019s captain Danny \u201cDeco\u201d Phiri is the other locally-based midfielder called up for national duty.","title":"Nakamba overlooked","media-type":"News","source":"Zimbabwe Chronicle","published":"2015-09-01T22:01:52Z"}

He wins at the time you need it the most, with four of his seven victories for Toronto coming after losses. He dominates virtually every time he steps on the mound. And he takes that ball, and hangs onto it, deep into games, year after year.\n\nPrice, with 208 1\/3 innings, has eclipsed 200 innings in five of his six full seasons, making at least 31 starts a year.\n\nThe man will be paid, more than any free-agent starter in baseball this winter, with a payday that surely will surpass $200 million.\n\nIf you\u2019re the St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees and Blue Jays, how can you not be salivating over the thought of having him in your rotation for the next seven years?\n\nConsidering the way he\u2019s dominating the American League, can you just imagine what he\u2019d do in the pitching-friendly National League with no DH and weaker lineups?\n\nPrice wisely won\u2019t divulge any preference for his next home, but considering the way he raves about the Cardinals\u2019 organization and its fan base, and living a five-hour drive away in Nashville, it\u2019s no secret that the Cardinals would have an advantage.\n\nSure, the Cardinals are leading the National League in ERA without him, but with Adam Wainwright on the DL and no real ace to carry them this postseason, they may realize just how badly they could use him in October.\n\nCan you imagine a rotation of Price, Wainwright, Michael Wacha, Lance Lynn and Carlos Martinez in 2016?\n\nOr if you\u2019re the Cubs, how about Jake Arrieta, Jon Lester and Price sitting atop the rotation? Price can also expect significant interest from San Francisco and Boston, where the Giants and Red Sox look to re-tool in modest to significant fashions.\n\nThe greatest thing that happened to all of the free-agent suitors for Price is that he was not traded in July to the Dodgers. If he gone to Los Angeles, he might have easily fallen in love with the place, just as Zack Greinke has done, giving the Dodgers the upper hand.\n\nGreinke will opt out of his contract after the season, but considering how much he enjoys everything but the traffic in Los Angeles, he\u2019s expected to return, only with a fatter bank account.\n\nIf the Dodgers want to go for the kill, they could conceivably have Clayton Kershaw, Greinke and Price all in the same rotation, giving them the most powerful starting trio since the Hall of Fame triumvirate of Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz in Atlanta.\n\nIf you already have a $307 million payroll, what\u2019s another $30 million salary on the books?\n\nPrice, widely regarded as one of baseball\u2019s ultimate teammates and role models, won\u2019t bother thinking about free agency until November.\n\nFor now, he\u2019s got a division, pennant and World Series to win, and if he keeps pitching like this, will have the world at his feet.\n\nAnd the 2015 Cy Young award in his trophy case.\n\nPrice isn\u2019t just out there pitching for stats or a paycheck, he\u2019s helping carry the Blue Jays\u2019 down the stretch, going 7-1 with a 2.17 ERA in nine starts since his arrival, all in meaningful and impactful games.\n\nIt\u2019s this continuing dominance, and Keuchel\u2019s horrid outing Wednesday night when he gave up nine earned runs and three homers in 4 2\/3 innings, with his ERA soaring 15.3% from 2.22 to 2.56, that tips the scales to Price\u2019s favor. Sure, it may be unfair, considering that Keuchel has been brilliant all year, leading the league with 17 victories (to Price\u2019s 16) and innings (211.1 to Price\u2019s 208.1), while pitching at least six innings in every start and yielding two or fewer runs in 18 starts.\n\nYet, this is September, in the middle of playoff races, when everything is magnified.\n\nAnd please, no one else should be in the AL Cy Young conversation.\n\nSonny Gray (13-7, 2.56 ERA) of the Oakland A\u2019s is having a splendid year, but not as strong as Price and Keuchel, who are pitching in pressure-packed games. Chris Archer (12-12, 2.69 ERA) of the Tampa Bay Rays, who has 241 strikeouts, is a top five Cy Young candidate, but also falls short.\n\nPrice is poised to join Kershaw, Greinke and Tim Lincecum as the only active pitchers with multiple Cy Young awards on their resumes.\n\nHe could potentially have a Cy Young award and World Series trophy in six weeks, and by the holidays, could be guaranteed at least $200 million, setting up future generations of his family.\n\nSometimes, nice guys really can finish first.\n\nGALLERY: MLB postseason matchups, as they stand","title":"Why the Cy Young Award is David Price's to lose","media-type":"News","source":"USA Today","published":"2015-09-17T15:56:16Z"}

You may have also seen the head-scratching on the part of analysts and industry-watchers, wondering why Apple would get into the automotive market, where low margins and high levels of regulation could lead to a ton of headaches for a company that's happily printing money with the iPhone.\u00a0 There's an easy possible answer here. Apple is building a car, sure. That much seems certain. But that doesn't mean it wants to get into the car business.\u00a0 By developing a car design, and then selling it to car manufacturers, Apple could push its vision for the future of cars\u00a0\u2014 while dodging much of the risk and costs associated with getting into the manufacturing business. In the manufacturing world, there's a concept called the \"reference design.\" Basically, you come up with a prototype of something, and then you either sell or otherwise give away that design for others to make.\u00a0 Google's cute little self-driving, steering-wheel-less cars, for example, are a reference design. Google has shown no interest in getting into the car manufacturing business, so it made a few prototypes in the hopes that an automaker will be willing to sink the capital to actually make the\u00a0little buggers.\u00a0 AP\nThe advantages here for Google would be twofold: First off, it means that it doesn't have to put in the considerable amounts of cash to get these built and on the road. Second off, it means that it's up to whatever brave manufacturer takes on the challenge to deal with regulatory and legal compliance matters.\u00a0 And, as a nice added benefit, it means that if, say, three companies decide to license the driverless car design from Google, it wins three times over, without any skin in the game itself. Moreover, any accidents or safety issues would be unlikely to wind up at Google's doorstep.\u00a0 Apple can play the same game. Before the Steve Jobs era at Apple, the computer company loved the concept of reference designs, even when it didn't always work out. Flickr\/nicoleleeMotorola ROKR, the first phone to support iTunes Music Store content.\nThe Apple Pippin, for example, was supposed to be a reference design for a games console running on the Macintosh platform. Ultimately, only Bandai and a smaller company called Katz Media took\u00a0Apple's idea and run with it. It was too much like a PC, and failed to catch on. Then there's the Apple Newton, a reference design for what you'd now call a personal digital assistant. These ill-fated hand-held computers could do little more than organize your contacts, read text email, and play some basic games. Still, Sharp, Motorola, and Apple itself\u00a0all made devices based on the Newton design.\u00a0 Or how about Motorola's 2005 phone, the ROKR? It licensed the iTunes technology from Apple, becoming the first-ever phone that could play music from the iTunes Music Store.\u00a0 The point here is that Apple is no stranger to licensing out its technology, even if it doesn't always seem like it. Matthew DeBord\/Business InsiderBMW i3\nAnd by giving out a design for an electric car right now, it means that car manufacturers are going to be building connected vehicles that are all but guaranteed to match Apple's design sense, while also supporting the CarPlay protocol for integrating an iPhone with the onboard systems.\u00a0 Better yet, Apple dodges all of those manufacturing costs, sticky regulatory issues, and investor uncertainty. Word is that Apple's already talked to BMW about using the i3 as a baseline for a car.\u00a0 Think of it as a preemptive strike: Right now, not every car supports Apple CarPlay. But in 2019, when we see the Apple Car, it could actually be a line of different models of Apple Car, from different manufacturers, all of them with \"Powered by Apple\" branding. They could all offer a sleek look, an efficient electric engine, and, crucially, support for\u00a0all of Apple's other technology, too.\u00a0 It would be a feat that would be hard for Google to top, with its experimental driverless cars. \u00a0 SEE ALSO: The Apple Car is coming in 2019 NOW WATCH: APPLE BREACH: Apps infected with malicious code found in the App Store","title":"How Apple could make a car without actually building a car","media-type":"Blog","source":"Tech","published":"2015-09-22T23:10:55Z"}

This included husbands and wives whose spouses died.\u00a0 \n\nThe redress is expected to run into millions of euros for those hit. According to estimates by specialist solicitors Spanish Legal Reclaims after analysing government data, around 30,000 paid tax in the three-year period. \n   \nUnfair tax: Those who faced an IHT bill on their Spanish holiday home during 2011-14 are entitled to compensation. Pictured, Andalucia in southern Spain \n\nThe tax charge was in many cases up to a third of the property's value and it varied between regions. \n\nIt can only be reclaimed by EU citizens after the Spanish government hastily changed its IHT law after the European Court of Justice ruled the legislation - which exempted residents from the charge - was discriminatory. \n\nThe ruling was made last September but it is believed thousands still haven't got the ball rolling with compensation - despite there being a five year limit to put a claim in.\u00a0 \n \nClaims typically take between six to eight months to process once they've been filed and the first glut of compensation is now being paid out. \n\nUnder the law, between 2011 and 2014 Spanish residents were exempt from up to 99 per cent of the tax charge depending on region, while homeowners with a property there had to pay the full amount within six months of inheriting. \n\nWith more Britons owning holiday homes in the sun in Spain than any other nationality, UK citizens were disproportionately affected. \n\nThey include Joan Ridsdale, a 62-year-old payroll administrator from County Durham who was hit with a \u20ac16,000 tax bill when her husband Gordon died. The couple owned a two-bedroom bungalow in the coastal resort of Almeria. \n\nMrs Ridsdale was forced to cash in her life savings to pay the charge and has since sold the property. \n\nThe Spanish authorities are now being forced to repay the inheritance tax paid by non-residents like Mrs Ridsdale. \n\nShe was one of the first to receive compensation from the Government earlier in the year. \n\nThe average repayment is \u20ac25,000, according to Spanish Legal Reclaims, a Barcelona-based law firm which specialises in helping non-residents to reclaim overpaid tax. \n   \nEU ruling: Last year, EU said the Spanish Government had acted unfairly - and people can claim redress \n\nLuis Cuervo, chief executive of Spanish Legal Reclaims, said: 'Losing a loved one is hard enough, but to then receive an unfair tax bill rubs salt in the wound. Yet for years this is what happened to thousands of Britons inheriting holiday homes in Spain. \n\n'Spain's authorities have agreed that non-residents who inherited a Spanish property during the past four-and-a-half years can claim back the tax they paid \u2013 but doing so is a complex and daunting task, as there is no single form to fill in. \n\n'Inheritors can only claim once, so it's essential they seek expert legal advice to ensure they get it right first time. \n\n'Spanish Legal Reclaims is representing 1,000 families from across the EU who find themselves in this position, and since the ECJ's landmark ruling our firm has had a 100 per cent success rate, securing a full refund of tax in every case.' \n\nBritons account for a substantial part of the law firm's business, it says.\u00a0 \n\nThe largest refund it secured for a British client was \u20ac94,000, the smallest \u20ac4,400. \n\nHowever, it takes a large 35 per cent chunk of any compensation on a 'no win, no fee' basis. \n\nMrs Ridsdale used the firm to handle her case \u2013 it secured a full refund of her \u20ac16,000 tax bill, plus \u20ac700 in back interest from the Spanish taxman.\u00a0 \n\nBut, with the fees, she was left with just under \u20ac11,000. \n\nThe firm says it is possible for British holiday homeowners to reclaim the tax themselves, but it is 'fiendishly difficult'. \n\nThey need to work out whether they can claim and then the process involves filling in multiple forms and making your case in court, which is all in Spanish.\u00a0 \n\nHomeowners only get one attempt to lodge a compensation bid. \n\n\u00a0","title":"Up to 30,000 Britons are eligible to claim compensation after Spanish government was forced to change 'unfair' inheritance tax laws on holiday homes","media-type":"News","source":"Mail Online UK","published":"2015-09-08T07:43:44Z"}
{"id":"37018d13-cbf8-428b-974c-b2e27177b224","content":"US spy chiefs can be blocked from accessing online data of European citizens, a court has ruled. \n \nIn what is being billed as a landmark decision, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) issued its opinion after Austrian campaigner Max Schrems challenged Facebook over the transfer of his personal information to American intelligence agencies. \n \nThe Luxembourg court found the Safe Harbor agreement between the US and Europe, which gives spies access to huge banks of data , does not stop watchdogs from investigating complaints or bar them from  suspending the transfers. \n \nThe arrangement allows the National Security Agency (NSA) to use the Prism surveillance system exposed by whistleblower Edward Snowden to wade through billions of bits of personal data, communication and information held by nine internet giants . \n \nMr Schrems said the ruling could have  major implications for EU-US data flows and US internet companies operating in Europe. \n \n\"After an initial review of the advocate general's opinion of more than 40 pages it seems like years of work could pay off. Now we just have to hope that the judges of the Court of Justice will follow the advocate general's opinion in principle,\" he said. \n \nIn his opinion, which the ECJ said is not binding, Advocate General Yves Bot found that data transfers are an important and necessary element of the transatlantic relationship between the US and Europe. \n   Promoted stories   \nBut he warned that the European rules which govern it are invalid. \n \nIn one of the most damning findings, the ECJ said the access US spies have to European data interferes with the right to respect  for private life and protection of personal data. \n \nIt said internet users in Europe have no effective judicial protection while the large scale data transfers are happening. \n \nThe ECJ branded the US spying as \"mass, indiscriminate surveillance\". \n \nMr Schrems said that while his case was specific to Facebook it  may also apply to other tech giants like Apple, Google, Yahoo and Microsoft. \n \nIn the 44-page opinion Mr Bot found: \"The access of the United States intelligence services to the data transferred covers, in a comprehensive manner, all persons using electronic communications services, without any requirement that the persons concerned represent a threat to national security. \n \n\"Such mass, indiscriminate surveillance is inherently disproportionate and constitutes an unwarranted interference with the rights guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter (of Fundamental Rights of the European Union).\" \n \nThe final ruling by the ECJ's 15 judges is expected later this year and while Mr Bot's opinion is not binding the court's final decision normally follows his initial assessment. \n \nMr Schrems, a Facebook user since 2008, first took his opposition to the Safe Harbor arrangement to the Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) in Ireland - famously based in the unlikely setting of offices above a corner shop in the town of Portarlington. \n \nEveryone on the social network in the EU signs a contract with Facebook Ireland, audited by the DPC, and under the US-EU data transfer all their details can be accessed by the NSA. \n \nMr Schrems's challenge to seek an investigation into what data of his was sent to US spies will come back to the High Court in Dublin after the ECJ issues its final ruling. \n \nHis action was sparked by the Snowden revelations. \n \nThe former NSA contractor triggered a wave of controversy when he leaked tens of thousands of documents about surveillance programmes run by the US intelligence services and foreign counterparts, including Britain's GCHQ, in 2013. \n   \n Share article  \n   \nHe fled to Hong Kong where he met journalists to co-ordinate a series of articles that exposed mass surveillance programmes such as the NSA's Prism and GCHQ's Tempora, which involve \"hoovering up\" vast volumes of private communications. \n \nOnce Snowden's identity was revealed, he fled to Russia, and he remains wanted by the US authorities.","title":"US spies can be blocked from accessing Europeans' online data - court","media-type":"News","source":"Telegraph and Argus","published":"2015-09-23T10:08:48Z"}

IT had been the beating heart of Nelson Bay for more than 50 years, a place some gathered for a hit and others flocked to for after-dark shenanigans. And even as the smoke continued to billow out of Nelson Bay Golf Club on Sunday, its current custodians vowed to return bigger and better.\n\n\u2018\u2018This is more than a golf club, it is a huge part of the community,\u2019\u2019 president Max Pride said.\n\n\u2018\u2018It is the hub of a lot of people\u2019s lives. It is devastating but we will get through it.\u2019\u2019\n\nAn early morning fire, believed to have started in the roof cavity, quickly spread to destroy the majority of the club. A huge verandah and the club\u2019s pro-shop underneath may remain standing, but most of the building will need to be levelled and rebuilt.\n\nThe club\u2019s 35 employees, as well as possibly a couple of dozen who work in the restaurant Blue Water Grill, are now without work.\n\nRestaurant proprietor Will Semmens said the place was booked out for Father\u2019s Day lunches and dinners.\n\nWedding receptions, sporting club presentation nights and other functions have also been affected.\n\nThe golf course was not damaged, and Mr Pride said it may reopen within days once a portable clubhouse is organised.\n\n\u2018\u2018There is no impact on the golf course itself except for the fact that we can\u2019t process green fees and the like,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe club was originally built in 1963, with multiple additions as the Tomaree peninsula grew and took the club with it.\n\nIt has about 3500 current members, including about 1500 playing members.\n\nSocial media was inundated with messages of sympathy.\n\nFire crews were first called about 12.30am but it was too late to save the club.\n\nFirefighters were forced to withdraw from inside the club as the flames shot through the roof cavity, collapsing large sections onto what was once the club\u2019s bar, auditorium, office and poker machine areas.\n\nCrews remained at the scene for most of Sunday to help extinguish spot fires which flared up.\n\nSome golfers who turned up for a spring round had been unaware of the fire and were turned away.\n\nFire investigators were looking into the source of the blaze, although early indications were that it began in the roof and quickly spread.
