Georgia Insurance Advisors has assured the public that all funds raised through this charity drive will be channeled towards supporting the young girl's family as they navigate this challenging time.","Bogart, GA (PRWEB) Georgia Insurance Advisors, a locally owned insurance firm serving Bogart and the surrounding communities, is launching a charity effort to provide for the family of Grace, a young local girl battling restrictive cardiomyopathy. Commonly referred to as an enlarged heart, restrictive cardiomyopathy often leads to diastolic dysfunction – the inability to adequately move blood through the circulatory system. Without surgery and treatment, restrictive cardiomyopathy can lead to heart failure. Grace Cantrell was diagnosed with restrictive cardiomyopathy at three years old and promptly began receiving treatment at Children's healthcare of Atlanta. Though doctors warned the Cantrells that they would likely outlive their daughter, Grace was saved by a donor heart that she received in a transplant on her fourth birthday. While the good news is that Grace is healthy and healing, her family is still struggling to manage the significant medical costs associated with her life-saving treatment. “We are all extremely thankful that Grace is alive and well,” says Mack McClung, owner and manager of Georgia Insurance Advisors. “With the money they spent on Grace’s treatment, the Cantrell family needs everyone in our community to pitch in and help make sure Grace is well cared for in the years to come.” Mobilizing a network of professional and personal contacts, the Georgia Insurance team is making inroads with friends, neighbors, and business associates alike as they raise awareness about Grace’s condition and seek donations that will be used to assist her family in paying off her med '/""/"

2,"In the digital age, social media has increasingly become a powerful communication tool for government agencies to connect with their residents. While some municipalities have embraced the idea of establishing official accounts on various social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, others still hesitate to jump on the bandwagon due to concerns about privacy, security, and other issues. Recently, the Lower Makefield Supervisors, a governing body for a township located in southeastern Pennsylvania, faced a similar dilemma when considering whether to create an official Facebook page for the township. After much deliberation, the Supervisors ultimately decided to abandon the idea of setting up a Facebook account and instead explore the possibility of using Twitter to communicate with township residents. This decision was not taken lightly, as the Supervisors acknowledged the popularity and influence of Facebook as a widely-used social networking site. However, concerns about Facebook's data privacy policies and potential security breaches cast doubt on the viability of establishing an official township account. ""The issue of privacy and data security is something that has been weighing heavily on us,"" said John Lewis, the chairman of the Lower Makefield Supervisors, in an interview with the New Hope Gazette. ""We want to ensure that any communication we have with our residents on social media is secure and safeguarded."" In addition to data security concerns, the Supervisors also discussed the potential risks of exposing the township to online trolling or abusive comments on Facebook, which is known to have a sometimes-toxic user community. By contrast, Twitter tends to have a more professional and less divisive tone, which may be more suitable for official township communication. ""We don't want to be in a position where we have to constantly monitor and moderate online discussions on our Facebook page,"" said Lewis. ""This would be an unnecessary burden for our staff and distract us from our main responsibilities of governing the township."" However, some residents of Lower Makefield expressed disappointed about the decision, as they believe that Facebook is a more convenient and accessible platform for them to interact with the township. ""I think it's a shame that the Supervisors are not willing to embrace Facebook as a way to connect with residents,"" said Jill Green, a long-time resident of Lower Makefield. ""Many of us use Facebook regularly and it would be so much easier to communicate with the township through this channel."" Despite the criticisms, the Lower Makefield Supervisors are committed to exploring alternative ways of engaging with residents online, and Twitter seems to be a promising option for them. By limiting the township's online presence to one social media platform, the Supervisors hope to streamline their communication strategy and ensure that important information is disseminated quickly and efficiently. ""We believe that Twitter can offer us the benefits of social media communication without the significant privacy and security risks associated with Facebook,"" said Lewis. ""We will be closely monitoring our activity on Twitter and evaluating its effectiveness in reaching our residents."" Overall, the decision of the Lower Makefield Supervisors to opt for Twitter rather than Facebook as the official social media channel for the township highlights the complex considerations that government agencies face when entering into the digital public sphere. As social media continues to evolve and mature, it is likely that these considerations will become even more significant, and municipalities will need to be proactive and adaptive in their communication strategies to meet the needs and expectations of their residents.","By D.E. Schlatter Digital First Media LOWER MAKEFIELD >> While neighboring municipalities such as Yardley Borough and Falls Township have jumped into the 21st Century and set up official Facebook pages, Lower Makefield’s board of supervisors are cautious about taking the plunge, at least on Facebook. At the July 15 supervisors’ meeting, the Electronic Media Advisory Board (EMAB) presented its recommendations that Lower Makefield should supplement its township website with Facebook and Twitter. But several of the supervisors balked at the suggestion, stating that if the township set up an official Facebook page, some of the postings in the comment section could be hostile and inflammatory. “I like the idea of a page, but then you bring in Captain Courageous on a keyboard and it can get out of hand,” declared Supervisor Dan McLaughlin. “I’m worried about a rogue person getting us on the national news,” he added. “Saying something about the police or safety at the pool.” But EMAB Chairman Zachary Rubin said that for Lower Makefield to use Facebook and Twitter is the best way to keep in touch with residents, especially if there is an emergency and information must be quickly dispatched. “It’s the best way of people communicating with the township,” Rubin said, noting that social media helps direct individuals to the township Web page where more updated information can be posted. Fellow EMAB member Jill Laurinaitis said that according to a recent Pew Foundation study, 71 percent of adults in the U.S. are on Facebook and 18 percent use Twitter, numbers which are much higher in the younger population. In an attempt to quell the supervisors’ fear of inappropriate comments, Laurinaitis explained, “People’s behavior is better on these pages.” Although she acknowledged that “you have to have somebody monitoring it.” According to Laurinaitis, other local governments with Facebook identities often have a staffer dedicated to reading the comments, and removing them if they do not fit into the page’s guidelines. Continued... “You have an editor,” said EMAB member Frederick Young. But Supervisor Chairman Kristin Tyler worried that if a Facebook page is set up the township would have to have an employee monitor all the comments, which could be both time-consuming and costly. Not all board members scoffed at the establishing a Facebook identity. Supervisor Ron Smith, who is the board’s liaison with the EMAB, said that Lower Makefield having a Facebook identity is “a great idea. “You can’t ignore the 21st Century,” Smith attested. “If it’s working elsewhere than it’s something we should aspire to.” Smith pointed out that nine years ago several Lower Makefield officials opposed televising the supervisors’ meeting, arguing that it would attract unruly individuals who would co-opt the meetings with hostile public comments. But that has not occurred, and he said the same fears appear to be aimed at using Facebook. Meanwhile, township solicitor Jeff Garton, who also represents Doylestown Township which has a Facebook page, said that so far the comment section there has been “pretty tame.” While the majority of supervisors for now were seemingly unreceptive to diving into the Facebook pool, setting up an official Twitter account received a better reception. Currently, the Lower Makefield Police Department is using Twitter to send messages and alerts to residents, and Chief Ken Coluzzi says it’s working very well. Continued... But Twitter is different than Facebook, according to the chief, “We don’t take comments.” Township manager Terry Fedorchak said that he would start working on whether the township should set up an official Twitter account. “The Twitter approach is more appealing to me than going on Facebook,” he maintained. The Electronic Media Advisory Board also recommended that the township update it somewhat antiquated website and make mobile apps available for smartphones so the Web page can be better accessed. This way, according to EMAB Chairman Rubin, Lower Makefield can interact more efficiently with its residents, as well as contact them during emergencies. Rubin and the police chief also noted that Bucks County has a new emergency notification system in place called BucksAlertPA, which replaces ReadyNotifyPA. Coluzzi advised residents who signed up for the old system to reapply to BucksAlertPA, so that they can receive updates and alerts through their smartphones, e-mails, and house phones.

3,"The Hever Castle Triathlon is one of the most highly-anticipated events on the UK triathlon calendar, offering a challenging yet picturesque course and attracting some of the best athletes in the country. This year's edition, set to take place on September 27th and 28th, promises to be just as exciting as in previous years, with a host of competitive races and family-friendly activities. The event, now in its seventh year, takes place on the stunning grounds of Hever Castle in Kent, a historic castle that dates back to the 13th century. The castle and its surrounding gardens provide a stunning backdrop for the triathlon, which includes a variety of race distances and formats to cater to athletes of all levels and abilities. The main event of the weekend is the Olympic Distance Triathlon, which consists of a 1.5km swim, 40km bike ride, and 10km run. This race is open to individuals and relay teams, with cash prizes for the top finishers. The course includes a swim in the castle lake, a challenging bike ride through the Kent countryside, and a run through the castle grounds and surrounding village. For those looking for a slightly less daunting challenge, there is the Sprint Distance Triathlon, which includes a 750m swim, 20km bike ride, and 5km run. This race is a great option for beginners or those who are looking to improve their times on a shorter course. In addition to the adult races, the Hever Castle Triathlon also includes a number of children's races, making it a great event for families. There are races for children aged eight and over, as well as a Mini Triathlon for younger children. The kids' courses take place within the castle grounds, where parents can cheer their little ones on from the sidelines. One of the unique features of the Hever Castle Triathlon is the Castle Swim, an open water swim that takes place on the Friday before the main races. This event allows swimmers to take on the challenge of swimming in the historic castle moat, with distances ranging from 200m to 2.5km. In addition to the races, there are a number of activities and attractions on offer throughout the weekend. There is a sports expo featuring leading brands and retailers, as well as a range of food and drink vendors to keep spectators and athletes fuelled up throughout the day.

The Hever Castle Triathlon attracts some of the top triathletes in the country, as well as a range of amateur athletes and beginners. In previous years, the event has been won by the likes of the Brownlee brothers and Joe Skipper, showcasing the high level of competition on offer. One athlete who will be looking to make her mark at this year's event is Lucy Charles-Barclay, who won the Ironman Lanzarote earlier this year. Charles-Barclay, who is based in Essex, is a rising star in the world of triathlon and will be looking to add the Hever Castle Triathlon title to her growing list of accomplishments. Overall, the Hever Castle Triathlon promises to be a fantastic weekend of racing and family fun. With a range of distances on offer, as well as a number of activities and attractions, there is something for everyone at this picturesque event. Whether you are a seasoned triathlete or a first-timer looking to take on a new challenge, the Hever Castle Triathlon is an event not to be missed.","Ultimate triathlon extravaganza set for Hever Castle Triathlon It is the final flagship race of the Castle Triathlon Series and a jam-packed, televised weekend with competitors of all ages and abilities signed up to take part in one of the biggest multisport events in the UK. Triathlon returns for the seventh annual Hever Castle Triathlon weekend over the 26th and 27th September, ready to write another historic chapter at the former home of King Henry VIII. Fittingly for its seventh edition, the number seven features prominently throughout the event – starting with a record breaking number of entries currently standing at 7,000. The youngest competitor lining up in the world's biggest kids race is seven, whilst the oldest competitor is 77. The stunning venue, located in the heart of Kent, welcomes competitors from across the UK and internationally in a series of distances and challenges (including the biggest children's triathlon in the world). Its position at the end of the busy triathlon calendar and the final stop on the Castle Triathlon Series means that there is a party-like festival atmosphere as triathletes sign off their season with PB's, new distances achieved or sporting success shared with their friends of families. The atmosphere is boosted by 500 camping through the weekend and lots of entertainment including bands, climbing walls, archery, trade stands, fun fair and pleasure rides. The event attracts some of the best triathletes in Britain who are set to race hard and fast for their share of the trophies and prize money. Up for grabs this year is a prize fund of £8,000 that stands at £2,000 for the Standard Distance race, whilst those triumphing in the toughest challenge of the day, the half-iron Gauntlet race, will also take home their share of £2,000. Further prizes are given for Series winners. Favourites for The Gauntlet 2015 titles The Gauntlet at Hever Castle is the biggest test in the Castle Triathlon Series. The half-iron distance triathlon takes competitors into the rolling hills of the Kent Weald and through an ‘area of outstanding beauty'. Triathletes who took on the 1.9km swim, 90km bike and 21km run last year unequivocally reviewed it as one of the ‘must-do' events in the UK and attracted to the challenge, the field has grown once again this year from 200 in 2013 to now over 850 – making it one of the most popular in the country. Spearheading the men's field will be the intriguing re-match between Darren Jenkins (Bastion 2015 champion) and Karl Alexander (Hever Castle Gauntlet 2013 champion). These two had an awesome battle at Hever Castle earlier this year over the iron-distance Bastion Triathlon in July, with Jenkins emerging on top with his fearsome run proving the decisive factor. Now set to battle it out again over the middle distance, will Jenkins once again have the upper hand, or will the shorter distance suit Alexander who will have less run course to cover before the finish line comes? These questions and more will all be answered over the race. Jenkins and Alexander won't have it all their own way as there is talent throughout the field, not least in the form of XTERRA professional Matt Dewis, Irish Middle Distance champion Kevin Thornton and talented racer Will Cowan – who can all challenge for the podium and have the class to win. British and Scottish Middle Distance Champion Nikki Bartlett is in the field and is the clear favourite for the women's title at Hever Castle Gauntlet Triathlon. Also in the field is Pete Dyson, Andy Dyson, Max Hazell, Ben Matthews, Colin Norris, Ben Pritchard and Neil Tandy. The women's race will feature Bex Milnes and Kim Morrison. Olympic distance speedsters Whilst the Gauntlet represents a test of speed over distance at Hever Castle Triathlon, the speed kings and queens will take on the Olympic distance triathlon, which comprises of the shorter (but no less testing), distances of 1.5km swim, 40km bike and 10km run. Competing for these titles will be elite athletes including Liam Lloyd, Phil Edgley, James Fearn, Calum Johnson, William Kirk and Scott Thompson. The women's race looks particularly exciting, with Catherine Jameson headlining the field. Jameson is a fearsome competitor on the Castle Triathlon Series circuit and has picked up wins at Chateau du Chantilly, Castle Howard and Cholmondeley already this year. Jameson is such a fan of the Hever Castle Triathlon that she has published her top ten reasons to do the race HERE . Hever Castle would complete the set. However, a challenge will come from another former Hever Castle Champion, Vicky Johnston and also from the reigning European Aquathlon Champion Hannah Kitchen. Hever Castle – the ‘must-do British race' In just six years the Hever Castle Triathlon has swiftly established itself as an essential destination for British and international triathletes, garnering plaudits and mainstream media attention for its picture postcard venue, elite action, age-group choice and festival atmosphere. There are no fewer than 14 race choices on offer making it one of the biggest events in the UK. To cement the race's title as the world's largest children's triathlon, over 1,600 junior athletes are expected to take part. The races will begin with an amended and unique open-water swim in the spectacular 38 acre Hever Castle Lake and River Eden. This creates an incredible spectacle that is rewarding for both the athletes and the spectators who can see one of the most exciting parts of the race up-close. Competitors in The Gauntlet will take on a single 1.9km lap whilst those racing in the Olympic distance will take on (for the first time), a single 1.5km lap. Those taking part will then transition onto the undulating cycle that takes athletes around a 20km circuit through the High Weald of Kent, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, with one lap for the Sprint and two laps for the Olympic-distance racers. Those on The Gauntlet will be on a specially designed two-lap course. The largely off-road run circumnavigates the estate and award-winning castle grounds before making the dash to the tree-lined finishing chute beside the lake. Fun for spectators too This year there is even more planned for friends, family and all the supporters at the Hever Castle Triathlon Triathlon, with a variety of live music, family games and of course a brilliant atmosphere for all.

4,"As the use of drones becomes increasingly popular, security measures at public events are also evolving. One of the major challenges faced by security personnel is detecting drones flying over stadiums, which can pose a significant risk to public safety. While these drones are easy to spot, stopping them is another matter entirely. In recent years, there have been numerous incidents of unauthorized drones flying over stadiums during sports events, causing disruption and posing a significant threat to public safety. Drones could potentially carry or drop explosives or other harmful materials, which could harm large numbers of people. This has prompted many stadiums to implement more robust security measures to detect and respond to drone incursions. One popular method is to use counter-drone technology. These systems can detect and track drones in the airspace around the stadium and, in some cases, disable them. However, counter-drone technology can be expensive and is not always effective. Some drones are small and difficult to detect at a distance, while others can operate at altitudes and speeds that make them hard to track. Moreover, the unauthorized use of drones is still a relatively new phenomenon, and the technologies to counter them are also still evolving. As a result, stadium security personnel must continually update their counter-drone measures to keep up with the latest trends in drone technology. One approach that has been successful is to use trained birds of prey to capture drones. Eagles and other large birds are trained to recognize drones as prey and swoop down to capture them mid-flight. This method is a natural and reliable way to neutralize unauthorized drones flying over stadiums. Another approach to counter unauthorized drones is to use trained drone pilots to intercept them. This involves flying a manned drone close to an unauthorized drone and neutralizing it by various means, such as catching it with a net or shooting it down with a laser. The use of manned drones in this manner is still in its infancy, but it shows promise as a cost-effective and efficient countermeasure to drone incursion. There are, however, legal and regulatory hurdles to using manned drones in this way. In some cases, the law prohibits the use of drones, whether manned or unmanned, to interfere with other drones. Safety is also a concern, and crashes between manned and unmanned aircraft could have disastrous consequences. Even so, the use of drones for security and surveillance purposes is becoming increasingly popular across the world. Drones can be used to provide real-time situational awareness to security personnel, to monitor crowds for signs of unrest or suspicious behavior, and to track and detrain troublemakers. However, drones can also be used by malicious actors to gather intelligence or carry out attacks. For example, in 2018, two drones loaded with explosives were used to attack the president of Venezuela during a public event. As the number of drones in use continues to grow, so too will the need for effective counter-measures. The problem of detecting and stopping unauthorized drones is not going away, and security personnel must remain vigilant in their efforts to keep the public safe. In the meantime, stadium-goers can rest assured that security personnel are doing their utmost to ensure their safety while enjoying the game.","Whether they're crashing into the bleachers or simply hovering above stadiums to get a cool picture of the action down below, drones have become semi-regular guests at the ballparks these days. That has put the federal government, local police forces and security think tanks on alert, trying to catch up to the technology and figure out how to prevent the hard-to-stop devices from doing major damage. ""It's scary for all of us,"" said Lou Marciani, the director of the National Center for Spectator Sports Safety and Security. ""A crash, even without a payload, has the potential to injure several people. And if they carry a payload, it could be anything from a weapon to anthrax to something worse than that."" Drone crashes, two days apart, at the U.S. Open in New York and before a Kentucky football game, made news earlier this month. But over the past two years, more than 50 unmanned aircrafts have flown over Major League Baseball and NFL stadiums, coming and going quietly — usually controlled by a hobbyist who either lost control of the device or wanted a picture of their favorite team in action. No harm done. But the prospect of the drones doing something worse has security experts looking for answers, and quickly. Last October, the Federal Aviation Administration issued notice that it's illegal to fly drones near Major League Baseball, NFL and NCAA Division I college football games and major auto races. Other sporting events can put their own bans in place. But the penalties for violating a ban — and who hands out those sentences — is still murky. In the Kentucky case, campus police brought wanton endangerment charges against the owner of the wayward drone; at the U.S. Open, New York police brought similar charges against a high school science teacher who lost control of his drone. The FAA issued a ""law enforcement guidance"" paper to help local jurisdictions figure out this new problem. It lists its own enforcement tools — including warning notices, letters of correction and civil penalties — but suggests state and local police do most of the work to detect the drones and enforce the penalties. In its notice about temporary flight restrictions at sporting events, the FAA lists reckless endangerment, operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence, trespassing and assault as possible criminal charges for unsanctioned drone use. Much of this, experts say, is the result of seat-of-the-pants law- and rule-making to combat a new and very fluid problem. And none of it addresses the most important issue: How to prevent a drone from coming into a stadium in the first place. ""So much of this is unknown and so much of it raises so many questions,"" said Derek Catsam of University of Texas of the Permian Basin, who studies stadium security issue. ""It's a case of where the technology is so far ahead of our ability to come to grips with it."" There are around 2,500 Major League Baseball games a year, so 31 drone sightings last year and nine so far this season does not constitute a major crisis, said John Skinner, the director of security for MLB. Still, baseball took part in a government project called ""Operation Foul Ball"" last year at the All-Star Game in Minneapolis to try to detect drones. Skinner said Minneapolis police worked with the Department of Homeland Security on a system that could identify the radio frequencies of drones before they took off. ""In essence, it worked,"" he said. But it didn't necessarily protect against the drones taking off; one found its way to the stadium during the home run derby. Also, there are private companies that can provide the same service using similar technology, and some of the teams have been approached about working with those companies. Among the dozens of uses for drones at sports facilities is attaching cameras to get before-impossible angles for the TV broadcasts. In January, ESPN cleared numerous regulatory hurdles so it could have drones with cameras follow skiers and snowboarders down the hill for the Winter X Games. ESPN got approval only by ensuring it would not fly the drones over spectators or in the air space of planes flying in and out of a nearby airport. Chris Calcinari, who spearheaded the approvals process for ESPN, called it a big opportunity because ""I don't think there are many events that would actually allow us to fly a drone."" Another application: For security. It's possible that drones themselves could be used to keep renegade drones away from fans. And a drone can hover over a stadium to look for weapons, fights and other disruptions. The idea of ""good"" drones and ""bad"" drones flying over the same stadium may seem like stuff of the future. But it's an idea that's not too farfetched. ""We're in that infant stage of, what does this all mean and where is it going?"" Marciani said. ""It's too early to know. You're crawling. You're not even standing up yet."""
5,"In a recent opinion piece on Austinnews.net, it was noted that some conservative critics of former Republican House Speaker John Boehner may be following “false prophets with empty promises.” The piece argues that those who attack Boehner as not conservative enough are buying into a false narrative that ignores his record of fiscal responsibility and conservative values. The article suggests that some conservative activists are more interested in scoring political points than actually advancing conservative principles. In the end, the article calls on conservatives to unite behind leaders like Boehner who have a proven track record of conservative leadership.","Washington Examiner Monday 28th September, 2015 Speaker of the House John Boehner, R-Ohio, skewered conservative groups and lawmakers, saying they are following ""false prophets"" whose messages ""whip people into a frenzy.""

6,"Residents and visitors of Ramsbottom were treated to a special bell-ringing ceremony at St. Paul's Church in honour of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II. The bells at St. Paul's Church in Ramsbottom echoed throughout the town as the congregation paid their respects to the Queen on the occasion of her 95th birthday. The ceremony was held on June 21st and was attended by members of the church as well as local residents. The bells first rang out at 12 pm, signalling the start of the ceremony. The ringing continued for 30 minutes, with the sound of the bells filling the air and drawing crowds from nearby streets. The ceremony was a fitting tribute to the Queen, who has been an integral part of British history for over 70 years. The bells of St. Paul's Church, which date back to 1870, have been rung on several important occasions throughout history, including the end of World War II and the Queen's Golden Jubilee. Reverend Julian Heaton, who led the ceremony, said: ""The Queen has served her country with grace and dignity for over 70 years, and we are honoured to ring our bells in her honour."" The bell-ringing ceremony drew praise from locals, who described it as a beautiful tribute to the Queen. Many also commented on the calming, meditative effect of the sound of the bells on a busy Monday afternoon. The bell-ringing ceremony at St. Paul's Church in Ramsbottom was a touching tribute to a much-loved figure, and a reminder of the importance of tradition and history in our modern world.","A GROUP of bell ringers gave a right royal welcome to church visitors last week. St Paul's Church in Maple Grove, Ramsbottom , hosted a jigsaw fair last week and welcomed several hundred visitors, including the Mayor of Bury, Cllr Stella Smith. As she arrived to open the fair on September 9, the church's bell ringers performed to mark the Queen's special day as she became the longest serving monarch in Britain. The ringers' group was set up in 2008 and there are currently 14 members, with three others learning the art form of ringing traditional church bells. According to St Paul's bell ringer Colin Willsea, it takes on average 16 hours to learn the basics of the discipline, but many more years to master. ""I know a chap who has been doing it for 40 years and he considers himself to be intermediate level,"" said Mr Willsea, aged 45, of Ramsbottom. He added: ""It is a lot of fun, but it can become a little bit of an obsession as there is always something new to learn. Share article ""I really enjoyed performing for so many people to mark the Queen's special day. It's the first time I have ever performed at a special event and I started the hobby 18 months ago.

7,"Global private equity firm Warburg Pincus has taken the lead in a $60 million investment in Civitas Learning, a US-based ""big data"" firm focused on analyzing student performance in higher education. The funding round includes contributions from existing investors and is expected to help Civitas expand its platform and pursue further acquisitions. Civitas' software platform uses data analytics to provide academic institutions with insights into student performance and helps them track progress throughout the academic journey. The platform can help institutions track students' learning habits and offer personalized recommendations to improve their academic performance. Warburg Pincus partner Jeffrey Herlyn, who will join Civitas' board of directors, praised the firm's cutting-edge technology and stated that their investment would support the expansion of the company's platform to new regions across the globe. ""We were impressed by the Civitas team's unwavering focus on digital innovation and their commitment to using technology to support student success,"" Herlyn said in a statement. The investment comes at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated demand for remote learning and education technologies. The online learning market was already growing at a rapid pace before the pandemic, but the health crisis has forced many institutions to shift entirely to online learning, making digital tools and technologies even more essential for academic success. Civitas CEO and co-founder Charles Thornburgh said the company is dedicated to helping institutions support student success in any environment. ""With this investment, Civitas will be able to build on our proven track record of driving student success outcomes and expanding into new markets, both geographically and across segments,"" Thornburgh stated. Civitas' platform is already used by hundreds of institutions worldwide, including Arizona State University, the University of Michigan, and the University of South Carolina. The company plans to use the new funding to further expand its footprint in the higher education sector and support continued growth. The latest funding round is the latest in a series of high-profile investments in education technology firms this year, as investors seek to capitalize on the growing demand for digital learning solutions. Recent investments include Knewton's $25 million funding round and Coursera's $130 million series F funding round.","(Reuters) - Private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC [WP.UL] said on Monday it has agreed to lead a $60 million investment round in Civitas Learning, an Austin, Texas-based startup that uses data analytics to help universities improve graduation rates. Education software and services companies have drawn record levels of investment this year, as many institutions are seeking to upgrade their learning tools to become more competitive in attracting and educating students. This was the largest funding round to date for Civitas, which was founded in 2011 by former Kaplan education executive Charles Thornburgh and an educator and administrator, Mark David Milliron. Universities and colleges that use Civitas give the company access to information from its student population such as grades, course loads, and financial aid packages. The company then analyzes the data and creates a system of predictive analytics to help universities figure out who might be at risk of dropping out. It also builds applications on top of its data platform that can help students pick majors, and analyzes for university administrators the effectiveness of courses. Civitas generates revenue by selling software subscriptions. About 850 campuses use its services, including the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Arizona, according to its website. Adarsh Sarma, managing director at Warburg Pincus, in a statement said Civitas was ""a pioneer in the field of using applied data analytics to improve student outcomes."" As state- and federal-funded universities face performance-based funding requirements in which graduation rates are increasingly tied to their budgets, companies like Civitas can be brought in to seek improved results. ""With this investment, we are going to be able to improve and accelerate both learning and student outcomes for our partner institutions,"" said Thornburgh, Civitas' chief executive. The company will use the money for research and development as well as potential mergers and acquisitions. Besides Warburg Pincus, the fundraising round includes previous investors including Emergence Capital Partners, Austin Ventures, Rethink Education, SJF Ventures and Gera Venture Capital. Warburg has a history of making money from investments in education technology. For example, it sold iParadigms LLC which makes ""Turnitin"" plagiarism software, for $752 million, including debt, to Insight Venture Partners last year. (Reporting by Liana B.

8,"The Common Admission Test (CAT) and the Management Aptitude Test (MAT) have long been known as the gateway to a successful career in management. However, the trend is now shifting and students are exploring alternative paths to reach their desired career goals. With the emergence of new specializations, students can now pursue courses that were unheard of a few years ago. Fields like data science, digital marketing, and cybersecurity are rapidly gaining popularity among students. One of the biggest advantages of pursuing these specializations is their multidisciplinary nature. Students from diverse backgrounds can pursue these courses, thereby increasing their chances of employability in a range of industries. Digital marketing, for instance, has created an unprecedented demand for professionals who can understand the nuances of branding and marketing on various digital platforms. Similarly, data science has opened up new avenues for students with an aptitude for mathematics and statistics. Apart from the traditional MBA programs, sector-specific executive programs have also gained popularity. These programs cater to professionals who want to upskill and specialize in certain industries like healthcare, energy, or finance. Apart from the academic front, many students are also exploring alternate pathways to gain practical exposure in their desired fields. Internships, freelance projects and volunteering are some of the ways to gain hands-on experience and stand out in a competitive job market. Entrepreneurship is also gaining significant traction among students who want to make a difference in the world. Several incubation centers and start-up accelerators offer resources to students who want to start their own businesses. These opportunities also offer exposure to diverse sectors, networking and learning opportunities from seasoned entrepreneurs. Gone are the days when an MBA was the only way to a successful career in management. With the rise of new specializations and unconventional career paths, students can now choose courses and career opportunities that match their strengths, interests and career goals. At the same time, the onus is on educational institutions to keep pace with these changing trends and offer courses that are relevant to the industry demands. An industry-academia dialogue is necessary to bridge the gap between what is taught in the classrooms and what the industry requires. To sum up, CAT and MAT will continue to be popular options, but students now have a plethora of alternate pathways to explore. The key is to focus on one's strengths, stay updated with the changing trends and keep an open mind to new opportunities. As they say, the world is your oyster, go out and grab it!","By admin - Tue Sep 22, 8:37 pm Edited by admin Rohan Ganeriwala Each year the number of students sitting for CAT and MAT increases. As chances of gaining admission to top institutes declines, students end up devoting years of study and preparation without realistic expectation of success. However, there are other options for students out there! If you want to be judged holistically, if you are a smart individual but bad test-taker, or if you are simply hankering for global exposure, applying abroad is your best route forward. Applying to top institutes overseas requires a combination of factors. The first are the exams—you may take either GRE/ GMAT as most colleges accept these tests. These tests are less comprehensive in material covered than the CAT and are only one part of your whole application. Students also need to prepare their professional CVs, speak to professors for recommendation letters, write individual essays for each college, and ready themselves for interviews. In the strongest applications, each of these components is well-rounded. Students may help themselves greatly by gaining experience in their respective field through internships and work experiences. Colleges often try to “look beyond the numbers,” for applicants—looking beyond just marks. Work experience, an understanding of one’s own caliber, and plentiful involvement with social projects and campus service all go toward strengthening the applicant’s profile It is important to receive right counseling in navigating these requirements. A good counselor can help shortlist colleges according to “fit,” i.e. through their suitability for individuals instead of blindly following rankings. Counseling can introduce you to programs like HBS 2+2 or YLP or even similar courses likes MIM, LBS etc. By working with an experienced mentor, you can maximize chances of admission by picking the right courses and the right schools. They can also help write essays showcasing yourself most positively, run through mock interviews with you, and keep your focus on the final goal—admission at a top university! A mentor can also help you apply to correct scholarships and funding sources, as expenses are a major concern for all applicants. Ensure your counselor is suggesting the best colleges for you, not their own pocket. There are many non-Indian options for higher education. If one does badly in CAT/GMAT/GRE, they can apply to Singapore/UK. Many colleges do not even require GMAT scores and only require undergraduate marks. However, you must be careful as both countries have several sub-standard institutions that are moneyspinners, not educational enterprises. But colleges like Bath, CASS, LSE, LBS, NUS, SMU, and NTU have tremendous value. For CAT you must prepare all year, and be judged on one exam. Since there is only one round a year, risks are high and students eventually have fewer choices. Applying to the US/UK’s top MBA programs allows for much more autonomy in the process. At the same time, you will be exposed to world-leading resources, cutting-edge facilities, global networking opportunities, and an international peer group. While it might seem scary, with the right guidance you can achieve admission to top MBA programs worldwide.

According to a recent report by the Guardian's Daniel Taylor, players who are trying to fight off relegation or win a promotion are most likely to take such risks. The report highlights several incidents of drug use in football, including the case of a player from the English Football League who admitted to taking cocaine to cope with the pressure of the game. The player in question was later banned for two years. Experts warn that the use of performance-enhancing drugs not only damages the reputation of the sport but also poses a serious risk to the health of the players.

The $2.1 billion, Briarwood, N.Y.-based Melrose Credit Union is giving rave reviews of its experience with the Raleigh, N.C.-based Sageworks’ new Electronic Tax Return Reader, which the credit union said helps improve underwriting efficiency. Sageworks introduced the Electronic Tax Return Reader as a major time-saving enhancement to its suite of credit risk management solutions for financial institutions. The complimentary upgrade automatically imports data from borrowers’ tax returns. “I am ecstatic with this product so far,” Steven Krauser, senior vice president of retail operations for Melrose CU, told CU Times . He explained that because the credit union's lending portfolio is so diverse, systematizing the evaluation of its underwriting process was a priority. Based on the NCUA's requirements, the credit union needed to provide the matrix for evaluating a loan in a standardized manner across all product lines. Krauser, who joined Melrose CU about a year ago, explained one of his goals was to study what the credit union could do better and began researching software that would allow him to do that. “We started in business in 1922 in taxi medallion financing,” Krauser said. “We have a significant portfolio in that. That is one reason we wanted to get involved in this.” The credit union also desired the ability to flag any problems in advance by adjusting and stress testing its portfolio, and to quantify and maintain its methodology. Melrose CU, which has an open charter and one branch, investigated which lending modules would integrate with its core system's existing data as well as standardize underwriting within its departments. The Sageworks suite, Krauser explained, allows the credit union to stress test its portfolio based on numerous factors such as loan to value, debt service coverage ratio changes and interest rate increases. The credit union started fully underwriting with the system on Aug. 4, 2015. “The quality of the underwriting analysis has increased dramatically,” Krauser pointed out, adding that the timesaving benefit will come later on. “The reason it is not there yet is that it is new and we’re still learning what to do, so there still is a learning curve.” Libby Berman, an analyst for Sageworks, said, “Our bread and butter at Sageworks has always been commercial loans and business lending, so the tax packages we support are mostly those commercial properties that accounting firms used for their businesses. We supply our financial institution clients with products that help them comply with regulations and improve their efficiency.” The Electronic Tax Return Reader works by optically “reading” electronic tax returns produced by many common tax packages, allowing for the creation of digital returns in the Sageworks system, where other financial information is also imported and stored. The program also benefits credit departments that analyze commercial real estate borrower information, as it also automatically populates Schedule E financial information for real estate properties. Sageworks said the enhancement allows credit unions to save a significant amount of time. “Our users are spending about 30 minutes per return on average, and obviously, some tax returns are much more complex with many real estate properties,” Berman pointed out. Through this program and its technology, that time can be pared down to two to three minutes, he said. “I don't know that a lot of our clients even knew this technology was feasible,” Berman added. “It has just been a recurring theme since we got into the credit analysis business, making sure that data was accurate and entered quickly. It is something people kind of expected. This will proactively solve most of those problems.” In addition to saving users time, the Electronic Tax Return Reader aims to reduce errors that can occur during the manual data entry process, and ensure consistency and accuracy during the production of commercial borrower spreads within the Sageworks Credit Analysis tool. For applicable tax returns, the technology ensures different analysts across an institution are inputting data the same way, which helps give credit unions a strong defense during exams. Berman said Sageworks also helps clients maintain consistency. “In the past, maybe there were multiple people entering data, and it is very easy to transpose numbers or enter something on the wrong line,” he explained. “The auto import helps eliminate inconsistencies and errors. The system also allows the financial institution the capability to go back in and make adjustments.” Melrose CU implemented Sageworks’ entire suite of cloud-based products about three and a half months ago, Krauser said. “Within that time, we were able to learn it, train our people, create a test site, play with it and then map our fields from our core system into the Sageworks system,” he noted. Krauser said Sageworks performs all calculations for Melrose CU. “It gives us the debt to service coverage ratio, loan to value and matrix on individual loans that we are doing, plus it gives us all the same information on global cash flow for those individuals and does it for our entire portfolio on that individual. So if you have a loan here and you are asking for a car loan, we can do the analysis on that car loan to see if it makes [financial] sense.” Currently, Melrose CU uses Sageworks’ tools for its commercial real estate department, taxi medallion lending area and business services unit. Krauser explained the credit union will eventually introduce Sageworks into its personal lending area as well, but first, it wants to gain full confidence using the tools for the largest portion of its lending business. “We have a real robust program here, and we want to make sure we have all the pieces and understand the full breadth and depth of it before we introduce it into other aspects,” Krauser said. “It is really a great automation of the process.” Scott Ogle, CEO for Sageworks, noted, “Sageworks offers solutions that simplify the complex processes that financial institutions handle every day. A key objective when developing or enhancing our solutions is to maximize time and efficiency. With our customer needs in mind, we developed the Electronic Tax Return Reader to become an integral component of each of our banking solutions, as it will save hours of manual data entry over the life of the solution.” Sageworks Credit Analysis allows credit unions to book loans faster, and with consistency and transparency, while also managing risk, the company said. The global cash flow analysis solution presents tax return input screens that create spreads, dynamic narrative analysis and customizable credit memos. “This is also important to those credit unions that are getting into more member business lending, who may not feel they have the right staff in place,” Berman asserted. “They can use a program like this to take care of some of the more manual work and allocate time more effectively to the actual analysis.” Berman pointed out the credit analysis tool also helps credit unions prepare for exams, especially those that had trouble in the past with credit decision inconsistencies and file errors."

21,"In recent years, Washington D.C. has become a hotbed for a new health crisis. Synthetic drugs, including fentanyl and its derivatives, have inundated the city, leading to an epidemic of overdoses and deaths. In this article, we will explore the extent of the problem, the government's response, and what needs to be done to combat this growing concern. Synthetic drugs, particularly fentanyl, have rapidly spread across the United States since 2013. Washington D.C. has not been immune to this trend, and in fact, has been hit particularly hard by it. Overdose deaths in the city have risen sharply in recent years, with fentanyl playing a major role. According to data from the D.C. Department of Health, there were 291 drug overdose deaths in the city in 2019, a 19% increase from 2018, and fentanyl was found to be involved in 160 of those deaths. The government has taken notice of this issue and has been implementing measures to address it. In March 2020, the D.C. Mayor's Office announced a new plan to combat opioid overdoses that included the distribution of fentanyl test strips and increased access to naloxone, a medication used to reverse opioid overdoses. Additionally, the D.C. Police Department has cracked down on drug dealers through undercover operations and seizures of large quantities of synthetic drugs. While these efforts are commendable, they still fall short of addressing the root of the problem. Synthetic drugs are often produced overseas and smuggled into the country through illegal means, making it difficult for law enforcement to intercept them. Furthermore, the demand for these drugs continues to grow, fueled in part by the rise of social media and online marketplaces that make it easier for people to purchase them. The solution to the synthetic drug crisis in D.C. requires a multifaceted approach. First and foremost, the federal government must increase funding for research on these drugs, including their production and distribution patterns. This will enable law enforcement to better target the source of the problem and prevent these drugs from being smuggled into the country. Secondly, there must be a greater focus on prevention and education. Many individuals who become addicted to synthetic drugs do so unwittingly, often believing that the substances they are taking are safe or even legal. Better education campaigns are needed to dispel these misconceptions and warn people about the dangers associated with these drugs. Thirdly, there must be an increased focus on treatment for those suffering from addiction. This includes access to medication-assisted treatment, counseling, and support groups. Individuals who become addicted to synthetic drugs often require specialized care, and there is a critical need for an expansion in the availability of such services. In conclusion, D.C. is facing a health crisis due to the prevalence of synthetic drugs in the city. While the government's efforts to tackle this issue are commendable, it is clear that a more comprehensive approach is needed. By increasing funding for research, focusing on prevention and education, and expanding treatment options, we can work towards a solution to this growing concern. The health and wellbeing of D.C. residents depend on it.","The emergent problem of the dangerous drugs known as synthetics has been featured in several recent media accounts. Their use has grown strikingly, and because of their association with violent behavior, so has law enforcement concern. The rising trend was shown in reports of emergency episodes attributed to “synthetic cannabinoids” by the District of Columbia Fire and EMS departments. Episodes had been stable at fewer than fifty cases a month from August, 2012, until roughly November of that year, when they spiked to over a hundred. That number subsided until approximately January of 2015, when they began an unprecedented, and persisting, climb. By June of 2014, the last data point captured, they reached 439 cases, an apparent increase of nearly 800 percent since the end of the year. Our attention has been triggered by some horrendous episodes involving consumption of synthetics, including an alleged stabbing death that has the city, already known for far greater use of the synthetic hallucinogen PCP among arrestees than other major cities, on edge. Has some underlying factor driven synthetic cannabinoid use in the nation’s Capital, as shown by these emergency episodes? What has changed that could affect either drug availability, or the acceptability of increased use, of this dangerous set of compounds? There is a correlation found in the timing. In November of 2014, District voters made news by approving legal “natural” cannabinoid use in the city – that is, marijuana. Then, in January of this year, the legalization took effect, with an increase in public consumption, while police backed away. Both developments seem to be echoed in the data. We must confront a disturbing question: by allowing “natural” marijuana to increase in acceptance, could the District have sowed the wind of the synthetic cannabis whirlwind? Advocates for drug legalization recognize that connection, but their response is the predictable resort of pro-marijuana advocates. Legalizers explain the increased use of synthetics as a consequence of the prohibition on “natural cannabis.” But that had ended just before the epidemic began. So how could prohibition be forcing the problem? The response from legalizers is revealing, as it discloses their next target in District policies: workplace drug testing. Since many synthetic users believe that they are not readily detected by potential employers, they must be substituting them for the “natural” marijuana product. So for legalizers, it is still the “punitive criminal justice system” that somehow incentivizes use of dangerous synthetic toxins. As they perennially argue, it is our crack-down on marijuana that drives consumers to more dangerous drugs. For advocates, the problem with marijuana legalization in the District is not that it led to a disturbing shift in the attitudes and norms of drugs use. It’s that it didn’t go far enough. We didn’t legalize sales, as well as use. And employers (like the Federal Government) still insist on drug-testing applicants. And because drug users want jobs, they have to use synthetics. Oddly, before November when “natural marijuana” was prohibited, this argument failed; there was then no spike in synthetic use, even though marijuana users were still, as now, subjected to drug tests. The legalizer solution? Legalize marijuana sales, but most importantly, eliminate workplace testing. That will surely end the demand for synthetics. It’s possible that the cause of the current epidemic is, as legalizers argue, this complicated incentive effect. But isn’t it simpler, and more faithful to the data, to posit that the District made a huge, predictable mistake when it opened the flood gates to legalized marijuana, and thereby shifted the entire drug using landscape towards an epidemic? The argument is not far-fetched. Perceptions and norms of disapproval matter for those contemplating drug use, and survey data are clear that for youth, there is a strong correlation between one prior behavior and use of synthetic drugs. Data from a study overseen by the National Institute of Drug Abuse showed that the use of “natural” marijuana is, in fact, a “gateway” for synthetic use. In fact, the use of synthetics by those who hadn’t previously used marijuana is 0.5 percent; that is, almost never. The true common sense understanding of the tragedy happening right before us is that the District of Columbia, by legalizing marijuana, produced a completely predictable effect. It made drug use more acceptable, and rendered police control more difficult. Sadly, as drugs of all sorts begin to flood the streets, the District is experiencing a rapidly-unfolding train wreck, of its own devising."
22,"The disappearance of William Tyrrell, the three-year-old boy who vanished from his grandmother's home in Kendall, NSW in 2014 has left Australians heartbroken and determined to find answers. In a show of solidarity with the missing boy's family, locals on the Fraser Coast have come together to organize a fundraising event with the goal of bringing young William home. The event, dubbed 'Stepping out to bring young William Tyrrell home', will see participants complete a 5-kilometer walk or run on Sunday, September 12, with all proceeds donated to the Where's William? Campaign, which was set up to assist with the search for the missing boy. The campaign has already gained significant traction throughout Australia, with many high-profile individuals throwing their support behind it. This latest initiative on the Fraser Coast aims to further raise awareness of the issue in the local community while raising much-needed funds to help with ongoing search efforts. Event organizer, Sarah Thompson, spoke about the importance of the fundraiser, stating, ""William's disappearance is something that touches all of us, regardless of where we live. We want to let his family know that they are not alone in their search for answers and that we, as a community, support them."" The event has already attracted a significant amount of interest, with over 150 individuals signing up to participate in the walk or run. Participants include people of all ages, from children as young as three to adults in their seventies. All are united in their desire to help bring William home. The event will take place at the picturesque Scarness Park on the Hervey Bay foreshore, with participants encouraged to wear something blue in honor of William's favorite color. The journey will be a family-friendly affair, with activities planned for children both before and after the walk. While the event is primarily focused on raising funds for the Where's William? Campaign, it is also aimed at raising awareness of the issue in the community, helping to keep William's story at the forefront of people's minds. ""All of us here on the Fraser Coast want to do our part to help bring William home,"" Thompson affirmed. ""We want to show his family that we will never forget him and will continue to do whatever we can to help find him."" The fundraiser is just one example of how Australia continues to rally behind the search for William Tyrrell. Let's hope that, with the ongoing support of Australians around the country, the answers his family seeks will be found, and he will finally be brought home where he belongs.","MUMS, dads and children at locations across the Sunshine Coast set off on a walk with one common mission: to bring William Tyrrell home. Similar events were also held across Australia at the same time, 10.30am yesterday. Exactly a year earlier, three-year-old boy William Tyrrell (pictured) was taken from his grandmother's home in Kendall, on the New South Wales mid-north coast. While there have been reports of sightings, the little boy, who disappeared wearing his favourite Spiderman costume, has not yet been found. He would now be four. A group of Coolum locals organised their own Walk for William, starting at Tickle Park and walking along the beachside cliffs to Point Perry. Despite the grey weather at least 150 walkers participated yesterday. Christina and Riley Clifford. Walkers wore red and blue in recognition of William's favourite superhero, and many kids - as well as organiser Angela Gray - donned full-length Spiderman suits. Ms Gray said the Walk for William idea was intended to ""make the community take note"". ""We will not sweep him under the carpet,"" she said to the crowd. ""We will keep onto this until he is brought home or until somebody is brought to justice. ""He is a little boy, like all of the kids here. He should be at home with his parents. ""Ours is a simple one in Coolum but it is in respect for William."" Organiser Angie Dunbavan said she hoped the various walks would jog someone's memory about the disappearance, or compel those with information to come forward. She said it also represented a chance for parents to start a conversation about safety with their children. ""It's a really good opportunity to raise community awareness around stranger danger,"" she said. ""About how to protect yourself as a child, and what parents can do to be more vigilant."" Yaroomba mum Christina Clifford attended the event with her son Riley, who turned three last week, the same age William was when he disappeared. Mrs Clifford said William's disappearance had hit her ""straight to the heart"". ""I just cried and cried,"" she said. ""Australia should be a safe environment to just let kids be kids, and taking advantage of a little three-year-old, it makes me sick in my guts, basically."" She said she was trying to talk to Riley about William during the walk. ""I'm trying now to explain to him what we're doing here, but it's not easy to explain to a three-year-old,"" she said. ""He keeps saying 'where is William, we have to try and find William'."""

25,"A new recycling technology that promises to be a “game changer” has received a $24 million cash injection from a group of investors. The process, developed by Canadian startup Carbicrete, aims to reduce the amount of concrete waste that ends up in landfills by upcycling it into a valuable product. Traditional concrete production releases large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, but Carbicrete’s technology creates a carbon-negative process by using steel slag and other industrial byproducts as an alternative to traditional cement. The injection from investors including the Quartz Opportunity Fund and GreenSoil Investments will help Carbicrete commercialize its technology on a larger scale, with plans to open a series of plants across North America. According to the company, the process involves using carbon dioxide to cure the concrete rather than water, making it stronger and more durable than traditional concrete. The company also claims that the carbon-negative process can offset up to 90% of the emissions associated with traditional concrete production. The investment in Carbicrete comes as the world’s population booms and cities expand, putting pressure on the construction industry to reduce its carbon footprint. “Carbicrete’s technology has the potential to be a complete game changer in the building materials industry,” said Brian Ostroff, managing director of the Quartz Opportunity Fund. “With the demand for concrete continuing to rise, and the associated carbon footprint that comes with it, we are excited to play a role in bringing a solution like Carbicrete to market.” Carbicrete is not the only company exploring sustainable alternatives to traditional concrete. Last year, Dutch company Green Minerals announced plans to use waste from steelmaking as a replacement for traditional cement. The company launched a pilot project in May involving the construction of a bike path made of its sustainable concrete. The path is expected to be more durable and require less maintenance than traditional concrete. As concerns about the environmental impact of traditional building materials grow, companies are increasingly turning to sustainable alternatives to cement and other materials. The $24 million funding round for Carbicrete shows that investors are starting to recognize the huge potential of this emerging industry. With its innovative technology and plans for expansion, Carbicrete could be at the forefront of a major shift towards sustainable construction in the years to come.","A major plastics recycling plant that will recycle the #3-#7 hard–to–recycle plastics such as yogurt containers and lawn furniture is slated to come online in October, servicing much of the US East Coast, thanks to a multi-million investment by the Closed Loop Fund. The fund has amassed millions of dollars from leading companies — including 3M, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, Goldman Sachs, Johnson & Johnson Family of Consumer Companies, Keurig Green Mountain, PepsiCo and the PepsiCo Foundation, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation — and plans to invest more than $500 million in US recycling projects over the next five years. The to cities and low interest loans to recycling companies. The first three recycling investments total $24 million. Closed Loop Fund’s first investee is a joint venture between QRS and Canusa-Hershman (CHR) to create a one-of-a-kind plastic recovery facility (PRF) in Baltimore, Maryland. Currently, 70 percent of communities across the US are not able to collect and recycle #3-#7 plastics, like yogurt containers and take out packaging or large rigid plastics such as crates, buckets, baskets and lawn furniture. The Closed Loop Fund says tor the first time ever, QRS and CHS will combine technology that can both separate these products and turn them back into raw materials for new products and packaging. The facility is able to process 4,500 tons of materials every month — double the capacity of what’s presently possible in the US. Beginning in October, QRS-CHR will service the majority of the East Coast, from Maine to South Carolina, increasing recycling rates and finally providing a recycling solution for #3-#7 plastics. The fund expects the opening of the facility to help divert 440,000 tons from landfills and reduce 555,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions. Closed Loop Fund’s two other investments are in Quad Cities, Iowa, and Portage County, Ohio, both important Midwest markets for recycling. These investments will allow the two communities to convert from dual-stream recycling systems to single-stream, making it easier for citizens to recycle. These communities are similar to hundreds across the south and Midwest with citizens who want to recycle, but without a convenient option. The fund says over the next 10 years, in Portage County alone, 37,000 tons will be diverted from landfills with a reduction of 110,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions. It expects Quad Cities to see 86,000 tons diverted from landfills and 250,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions reduced. Lack of infrastructure is a major barriers to more recycling in the US. In 2013, lack of recycling infrastructure caused US cities to collectively spend over $5 billion dollars to landfill over $11 billion worth of commodities that could have been recycled, according to the Closed Loop Fund.

27,"Agenda 2030 is a crucial roadmap for the future of the Asia-Pacific region, providing a blueprint for sustainable development that will benefit both current and future generations. With less than a decade left to implement this ambitious agenda, it is essential that countries in the region work together to ensure its success. The United Nations adopted Agenda 2030 in 2015, setting out 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030. The SDGs cover a wide range of issues, including poverty, inequality, climate change, and sustainable economic growth. In the Asia-Pacific region, the SDGs are particularly important. The region is home to more than half of the world's population and accounts for nearly two-thirds of global economic growth. However, it also faces significant challenges, including widespread poverty, environmental degradation, and inequality. To address these challenges, countries in the region must work together to implement the SDGs. This will require cooperation across borders as well as between government, civil society, and the private sector. One of the key challenges facing the Asia-Pacific region is poverty. Despite significant progress in recent decades, many people in the region still live in extreme poverty. The SDGs aim to eradicate poverty in all its forms and ensure that no one is left behind. Achieving this goal will require a concerted effort by governments, civil society, and the private sector. It will require investments in education, healthcare, and infrastructure, as well as measures to promote inclusive economic growth and reduce inequality. Another major challenge facing the region is environmental degradation. The Asia-Pacific region is home to some of the world's most significant biodiversity hotspots, as well as major rivers and seas. However, rapid economic growth and urbanization have taken a toll on the region's environment, leading to air and water pollution, deforestation, and loss of wildlife habitat. The SDGs include several targets aimed at preserving the region's natural resources and promoting sustainable development. These include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the use of renewable energy, protecting biodiversity, and reducing waste. Finally, the SDGs also aim to promote sustainable economic growth in the region. This will require a shift away from the traditional growth model, which has relied heavily on fossil fuels and natural resources. Instead, the region must embrace new, more sustainable forms of economic development that prioritize environmental sustainability and social equity. Achieving this goal will require significant investments in research and development, as well as policy measures to promote innovation and entrepreneurship. It will also require cooperation across borders and between sectors, as well as engagement with the private sector. In conclusion, Agenda 2030 is vital to the future of the Asia-Pacific region. It provides a roadmap for sustainable development that offers a better future for all. However, achieving these ambitious goals will require a concerted effort from governments, civil society, and the private sector in the region. We must work together to ensure that the Asia-Pacific region becomes a model for sustainable development, leading the way towards a better, more equitable future for all.","The resounding endorsement by global leaders last week in New York of the groundbreaking and transformational 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, more than two years in the making, sparks new hope and optimism for multilateralism. The 2030 Agenda, based on 17 goals and 169 targets, may seem overly ambitious to some, but poverty eradication cannot be sustained without comprehensive progress in economic growth, social justice and ecological sustainability. This is a bold and inspirational new roadmap that will guide us to more sustainable growth, which is resource-efficient and respects planetary boundaries－meeting our present needs without mortgaging the wellbeing of future generations. This change is urgently needed in the countries of Asia and the Pacific. Although our region has an impressive track record of economic growth and poverty reduction, more than 1.4 billion people still live in poverty, social disparities are widening and growth remains inefficient and wasteful. Our region has a shared responsibility to lead, which is why mainstreaming the 2030 Agenda in development plans and budgets, and backing them with strong oversight will be critical for successful implementation. Five conditions must be met to pave the way for Asia-Pacific governments to make this happen: First, sufficient financial resources are needed. The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) estimates that the Asia-Pacific region will need to invest between $2.1 trillion and $2.5 trillion per year to fund a comprehensive agenda for sustainable development. These resources are available: regional national savings total nearly $8.9 trillion, financial assets of the wealthiest regional individuals are estimated to be about $35 trillion, and foreign exchange reserves account for more than $7 trillion. Most of these sources of savings are currently adding to liquidity, held dormant in deposits or financing third-party country deficits. We need instead to effectively harness them along with unwavering political commitment to exploit domestic resources for development. Developing economies of our region have, on an average, among the lowest tax-to-GDP ratios in the world. Leveraging the potential of strengthened tax regimes is key; public interest must override the vested interests so that governments can remove tax exemptions and tackle tax evasion practices which are obstacles to investment in better access to basic services. Second, good governance and inclusion has to be embedded in policy execution and implementation. The capacities of governments to engage multiple interest groups with widely varying perspectives, to effectively regulate excesses, monitor policy impacts and adjust policy responses are now critical. Governments must also become more adept at dealing with the unexpected and unpredictable events－and enabling all groups in society to respond positively to environmental, economic or social shocks. Third, innovations, new technologies and associated know-how must drive sustainable development across the region, yet innovation gaps in Asia and the Pacific remain very large. Only five Asia-Pacific countries are featured in the top 20 of the 2014 Global Innovation Index. Effective alignment and reinforcement of science, technology and innovation, through the right policies and regulatory frameworks as well as partnerships to facilitate technology transfer, will be mission-critical for successful sustainability. Fourth, we need to pair innovation with resources, enabling countries to find and adapt the best policy options for sustainability. Partnerships and stronger, more diversified regional platforms for South-South cooperation, such as those provided by ESCAP and its Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development, provide great opportunities for our region to lead the way in ending poverty, transforming lives and protecting the planet. Fifth, climate action must be integrated across all areas of policy and governance－social, environmental and economic. While emissions must be reduced through a focus on low-carbon energy, transportation and buildings and through energy efficiency, we must also build more resilient societies, prepared for frequent and extreme weather events and their impacts, such as changes in food production systems and migration.

28,"As the leaves begin to turn and the air gets a little crisper, we all know what that means: pumpkin spice season is officially here. But has the craze gone too far? Here are six ways in which we might have crossed the line into pumpkin spice overload. 1. Everything Is Pumpkin Spice-Flavored It seems like every year, more and more products jump on the pumpkin spice bandwagon. From coffee and tea to cereal and oatmeal, it's hard to find a food or drink that doesn't have a pumpkin spice version. 2. Pumpkin Spice-Flavored Alcohols While pumpkin spice lattes have been around for a while, now there are pumpkin spice-flavored beers, liquors, and even vodka. It's easy to get carried away with the seasonal flavor. 3. Pumpkin Spice In Non-Food Items Pumpkin spice is no longer just a flavor for food and drink. Now there are pumpkin spice candles, air fresheners, and even car deodorizers. It's a bit too much. 4. Pumpkin Spice-Flavored Toothpaste Believe it or not, there is pumpkin spice toothpaste on the market. This is a flavor that should stay far away from our toothbrushes. 5. Pumpkin Spice-Flavored Meat Yes, you read that right. There are now pumpkin spice-flavored sausages and meatballs. This is a flavor that has no place in savory dishes. 6. Pumpkin Spice-Flavored Lip Balm Finally, we have pumpkin spice lip balm. While it might be okay for a quick seasonal fix, do we really need our lips smelling like cinnamon and nutmeg all day? In conclusion, while pumpkin spice is a delicious seasonal flavor, companies have gone a bit overboard with it. It's time to scale back and let the flavor return to its natural habitat - a good old-fashioned pumpkin pie.","Ah, it’s that time of the year… Chilly weather, sweaters, Halloween costumes, pumpkin spice everything and… No, wait, it’s barely September. I’m sitting here at my desk wearing a sundress and sandals. It’s Fall doesn’t officially start for about three more weeks. This pumpkin spice mania has got to stop, people. Especially so early in the year. While we can get behind pumpkin spice lattes (and pumpkin spice ales) every now and again (and are glad to hear Starbucks will actually be using pumpkin in its recipe this year ), pumpkin just doesn’t need to be an ingredient in every item we eat this fall. (We’re glad to hear that that Pumpkin Spice Four Loko was all a hoax.) Here are some products we think go a bit too far: Pumpkin Spice Pop Rocks So a liberal dose of sugar with a sprinkling of nutmeg? (Photo: Mike Mozart , Flickr.) Pumpkin Spice M&Ms While M&Ms are certainly delicious in the natural state (peanut butter, plain and crispy are all fine by us), we’ve been a bit less taken by seasonal M&M flavors, and pumpkin spice is no exception. (Photo: Mike Mozart , Flickr.) Pumpkin Pie Spice Pringles Even Pringles must have realized they’d gone too far… They’re no longer selling their pumpkin spice-flavored potato chips this year. (Photo: Joel Kramer , Flickr.) Pumpkin Spice Jell-O Pudding Why does this exist? Isn’t it just as quick to grab a can of pumpkin filling if you’re planning on making a pie? What would the consistency be like? So many questions. Then again, the reviews we read about it tend to be pretty positive. (Photo: Mike Mozart , Flickr.) Page 2 of 2 - Pumpkin Pie Peanut Butter Pumpkin spice? Delicious. Peanut butter? Doubly delicious. Together, in whipped form? Not so much. Leave our peanut butter alone, JIF. (Photo: Mike Mozart, Flickr .) Pumpkin Spice Gum Nooooo. Why, Wrigley’s? Why, Trident? (Photo: Mike Mozart , Flickr.) Are you a pumpkin spice fan? Or do you prefer other fall flavors?"
29,"President Donald Trump has promised ""major tax relief"" for most Americans as part of his plan to overhaul the tax code. Speaking at a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on April 29, the president outlined his vision for a simpler, fairer tax system that would benefit middle-class families and small businesses. ""We're going to massively lower taxes on the middle class, reduce the tax burden on American businesses, and make our tax code more simple and fair,"" Trump told the cheering crowd. ""We want to make it so that you can file your taxes on a postcard. That's how simple it's going to be."" The president's plan includes cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, eliminating the estate tax (also known as the ""death tax""), and doubling the standard deduction for individuals and families. He also wants to reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three, with rates of 10 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent. The top rate would apply to those earning more than $500,000 a year. Trump argues that these changes would stimulate economic growth, create jobs, and put more money in the pockets of hardworking Americans. ""The current tax code is a disaster,"" he said. ""It's complicated, it's unfair, and it's just plain wrong. It punishes success and rewards failure. We can do better than this, and we will."" Critics, however, say that the president's plan would largely benefit the wealthy and add trillions of dollars to the national debt. They point out that the estate tax only applies to estates worth more than $5.49 million for individuals or $10.98 million for married couples, meaning that only the super-rich would benefit from its elimination. They also argue that cutting the corporate tax rate would primarily benefit shareholders and executives, rather than workers or consumers. ""There's no doubt that the wealthy will benefit the most from this plan,"" said John Podesta, former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton and chair of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. ""It's a massive giveaway to the top 1 percent, and it will lead to deeper inequality and a weaker economy."" Trump's proposal has already faced criticism from some members of his own party, who worry about the impact on the deficit and the potential loss of revenue. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, a Republican and a member of the Senate Budget Committee, has called the plan ""a massive tax cut for the rich disguised as a reform,"" and said that he would oppose it unless it was revenue-neutral. Despite the opposition, the president remains optimistic about the prospects for his tax plan. He has promised to work with Congress to iron out the details and pass a bill by the end of the year. ""We're going to pass the biggest tax cut in history,"" he declared in Pennsylvania. ""And it's going to be a great thing for our country."" For many Americans, the promise of lower taxes is a welcome one. The Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank, estimates that the average family would see a tax cut of $1,600 under Trump's plan, while the top 1 percent of earners would see an average cut of $270,000. Whether the president's plan will be enough to boost the economy and improve the lives of ordinary Americans remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: the debate over tax reform is just beginning, and it promises to be a contentious one.","""It will provide major tax relief for middle income and for most other Americans. There will be a major tax reduction,"" Trump said Monday at a press conference at Trump Tower in New York as he unveiled his plan to revamp the tax code. ""It'll simplify the tax code, it'll grow the American economy at a level that it hasn't seen for decades."" The highly anticipated tax plan comes as Trump is being pressed to provide more details about how his administration would govern. One of the biggest beneficiaries appears to be families that draw the smallest paychecks. Individuals that make less than $25,000 (and $50,000 for married couples) would pay no income taxes under Trump's plan. However, the proposal would also be a boon for the wealthiest Americans like Trump -- the top bracket includes individuals making $150,001 and more and couples making $300,001 and more -- who would pay an income tax rate of 25%. That's a dramatic cut from the current top rate of close to 40%. The tax cuts for top earners could open Trump up to charges of hypocrisy. The real estate magnate has surged to the top of the polls by touting a populist tone, lamenting that wealthy people like himself should pay more. Asked at Monday's press conference how his proposal would affect his own tax rate, Trump dodged the question, saying: ""We're reducing taxes, but believe me, there will be people in the very upper echelon that won't be thrilled with this."" He also declined to say how much taxes he currently pays, only saying, ""I fight like hell to pay as little as possible."" Perhaps the most pressing question that Trump must answer is how he would raise enough revenue to offset his plan's deep tax cuts, though he insisted Monday that his proposal would not add to the country's debt or deficit. The candidate says he would make up for the difference in a number of ways: killing certain deductions for the rich and creating incentives for U.S. companies to bring back cash currently held overseas, thereby boosting growth at home. Trump's tax plan broadly mirrors that of one of his main rivals: Jeb Bush. Bush's proposal released this month also reduces the number of income tax brackets -- to three from the current seven. The highest tax bracket under the former Florida governor's plan is 28%, and the lowest is 10%. Bush also proposed lowering the corporate tax rate from 25% to 20% -- another popular idea among conservatives. Trump would go even further, lowering the rate to 15%. Like Bush, one loophole Trump would target is the preferential treatment for carried interest, which is a share of profits paid to investment managers. Since launching his White House campaign in June, Trump has made sweeping attacks on hedge fund managers who are paid in carried interest. Trump, who claims that his personal assets are valued at more than $10 billion, frequently makes the distinction between investors who work in real estate and those on Wall Street. Hedge fund managers, he often says, fall in the category of special interests backing some of his well-connected and best-funded rivals. ""I know them. They all are supporting Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton,"" Trump told CNN at a campaign stop in Nashville, Tennessee, last month. ""They make a lot of money and a lot of it is luck. They pick a stock and all of a sudden they make a lot of money. I want the hedge fund guys to pay more taxes."" Still, the plan might not be too tough on Wall Street. Since Trump's proposal would slash the income tax rate across the board, taxing carried interest as regular income under Trump's plan would mean investors still pay far less than what they would if the carried interest loophole were done away with under the current tax code. The tax rate of hedge fund managers is a favorite political target for the 2016 presidential candidates. ""We will treat all noninvestment income the same, so unless you stake capital in an investment, you won't be able to claim the capital-gains tax rate on your market gains,"" Bush's tax proposal said. It's also popular rallying cry for the Democratic candidates. Former Secretary of Hillary Clinton has been hitting Wall Street tax breaks since the first days of her campaign, as she's faced pressure from progressive Democrats to embrace a more populist agenda. Antagonism towards Wall Street is a central message of Clinton's rivals like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley."

32,"Residents of Teignmouth were treated to an impromptu performance by the Pied Busker on Friday, as he led the town to its annual charity festival. The Pied Busker, real name Peter Marshall, is a well-known local figure who has been performing on the streets of Teignmouth for over 20 years. His distinctive style, which incorporates a range of instruments including guitar, violin, and harmonica, has earned him a loyal following in the town. On Friday afternoon, the Pied Busker took to the streets once again, leading a procession of local musicians and artists to the Teignmouth Community Centre for the town's annual charity festival. The event, which raises much-needed funds for local charities and community projects, attracted a large crowd, with visitors enjoying a range of live music, food, and entertainment throughout the day. Marshall, who has been performing at the charity festival for many years, was keen to show his support for the event by leading the procession. ""I'm always happy to lend my support to such a worthy cause,"" he commented. ""It's great to see the whole town coming together to support our local community."" The event was a huge success, with organisers reporting record-breaking attendance figures and a substantial amount of money raised for charity. ""We're absolutely thrilled with the turnout,"" said organiser Tom Robinson. ""It's fantastic to see so many people showing their support for our local community, and we're grateful to the Pied Busker for helping us lead the way."" The Pied Busker's performance and involvement in the charity festival once again highlights the important role that local artists and musicians play in bringing communities together and supporting important causes. Teignmouth can certainly count the Pied Busker among its most beloved and community-minded residents.","Comments (0) TO GEAR up for their first Oxjam Takeover, the Pied Busker of Teignmouth was drumming up support this weekend. The Pied Busker of Teignmouth, with a few other local musicians, walked the streets of Teignmouth entertaining shoppers for charity on Saturday. The procession started outside the Oxfam shop and then walked to significant places to stop and busk ahead of the main Teignmouth Takeover event next month. The group continued to Finley Browns Cafe where they had equipment set up to continue the music and do an intimate gig. Lee Hall, from band Datura, performed a solo set, as well as Tom Hayes and Robert Johnson, from band Alpha Tide. There were bucket shakers outside the door to attract more of an audience and let them know what was going on. Oxjam organiser Georgie Hellier said: ""Our fundraiser, the Pied Busker of Teignmouth, went amazingly well. ""Our musicians were so talented and the busker had a great cheeky personality to really embrace the slightly unconventional event, get fully involved and attract the public's attention. ""All the members of the public who we saw were genuinely intrigued with what we were doing, and so generous when they knew what we were raising money for. We are really happy with the amount we raised for Oxfam. ""Finley Browns Cafe was the perfect little venue to host the second part of our fundraising event. The owners, Martin and Faye, were so accommodating and really keen to get involved and help Oxjam Teignmouth.""

35,"In a marked sign of weakness in the US economy, durable goods orders have taken a major plunge, causing a significant drop in the stock market. On Thursday, the US Department of Commerce announced that durable goods orders fell by 1.2% in October, the largest drop seen in three months. This news sent investors into a frenzy, causing widespread declines in the stock market. According to the Commerce Department's report, the decline is primarily due to a decrease in orders for transportation equipment, particularly commercial aircraft and motor vehicles. Additionally, orders for primary metals and fabricated metal products saw decreases as well. The drop in durable goods orders is concerning as it is a key indicator of the overall health of the US economy. Durable goods, which are products that are expected to last at least three years, are typically more expensive and are directly tied to consumer and business confidence. The news of the drop in durable goods orders has caused significant panic among investors, resulting in large sell-offs across a wide range of sectors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by nearly 500 points, or 1.7%, while the S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite both fell by over 1%. As the US economy faces increasing headwinds, investors will likely remain cautious, causing more volatility in the stock market in the coming weeks.","Durable goods orders dropped 2% in August sending the markets tumbling to a sharply lower open with the Dow crashing 242 points to 16,037.

38,"Newark's downtown area is set to gain a new hotel after a local developer announced plans to transform a long-vacant building into a modern hotel establishment. The building, which has been unused for several years, will be renovated into a stylish hotel that promises to enhance the city's hospitality options. According to the developer, the new hotel will feature state-of-the-art amenities and an upscale design that reflects the growing demand for stylish and modern accommodations in Newark. The hotel will be situated in the heart of downtown, and is set to be a key destination for travelers and tourists seeking easy access to the city's many attractions. The announcement of the new hotel comes amid a wave of revitalization projects in Newark, as the city continues to experience a major economic and cultural resurgence. The new hotel is expected to be a major boon for the city, helping to attract more visitors and drive economic growth. Speaking about the project, Mayor Ras Baraka expressed his excitement for the new hotel, saying ""This development will be a tremendous addition to our downtown area, helping to build on the many successes we've already seen in recent years. I'm pleased to see developers investing in our city and helping to bring new life to these vacant buildings."" The new hotel is expected to create dozens of new jobs in the city, providing opportunities for local residents to work in the growing hospitality industry. The developer has committed to working with the city and local community to ensure that the new hotel is a positive addition to Newark's downtown landscape. Construction on the new hotel is set to begin later this year, with an expected completion date of 2022. As Newark continues to grow and thrive, this new hotel will undoubtedly be a key part of the city's ongoing renaissance, further enhancing its reputation as a dynamic and exciting destination for visitors from around the world.","NEWARK – The city's downtown may soon be home to another new hotel. Hari Newark Urban Renewal LLC has filed plans with the city to convert the former Catholic Charities building at 1136-1166 Raymond Boulevard into a Homewood Suites Hotel by Hilton extended-stay hotel. The Edison-based developer is also seeking a 20-year tax abatement from the city, which the Municipal Council could approve at its regular meeting Wednesday night. The 12-story building across from Military Park is currently vacant. It is bordered by a parking garage to the east, and Commerce Court to the west. PLUS: Newark alters regulations to pave way for potential downtown casino Hilton spokeswoman Tiffany Wilson said she had no information on when the hotel might open or any agreement with Hari Newark Urban Renewal. Public records indicate that the Edison-based development company is owned by Mehendra Patel, who could not be reached for comment. The new hotel would be one of several planned to open around Newark in the coming years, after the city went nearly four decades without a single new one. That streak ended in 2012, when the Courtyard Marriott opened near the Prudential Center arena downtown , and others have followed, including the boutique Hotel Indigo on Broad Street. Last year, officials approved plans for a Carvi Hotel at the intersection of Lafayette and Monroe streets – the first to be built in the city's Ironbound section . Hilton also has plans for a 108-room Home2 Suites hotel on Haynes Avenue in the South Ward, close to the site of a proposed new train station along a new leg of the PATH rail line to Newark Liberty International Airport.

40,"Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest brewer, announced on Tuesday its plan to acquire a craft brewer in an effort to expand its portfolio of high-quality artisanal beers. The acquisition will give Anheuser-Busch access to a growing segment of the beer market, as it continues to diversify its offerings. The craft beer industry has experienced exponential growth in recent years, with consumers looking for unique, locally produced beers with varied and complex flavor profiles. Anheuser-Busch has recognized this trend and sees the acquisition as a strategic move to capitalize on the craft beer market's steady growth. While the name of the craft brewer has not yet been disclosed, Anheuser-Busch has confirmed that the brand will retain its identity and remain independent in terms of production and distribution. The company has also stated that there will be no job losses at the acquired brewery, and all employees will be retained. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the next few months, subject to regulatory approval. Once the deal is closed, Anheuser-Busch will begin to distribute the new craft beer through its vast distribution network. This acquisition marks Anheuser-Busch's latest foray into the craft beer market. In recent years, the company has acquired several smaller craft breweries, including Goose Island, 10 Barrel Brewing, and Wicked Weed. These acquisitions have allowed Anheuser-Busch to tap into the craft beer trend while enabling them to scale production and distribution to meet growing demand. Anheuser-Busch's CEO, Carlos Brito, stated, ""We continue to see strong growth in the craft beer market and are committed to meeting consumer demand for high-quality, artisanal beers. This acquisition is another step in our strategy to build a diverse and balanced portfolio of beers that meet the evolving tastes of consumers."" The craft beer industry's growth shows no signs of slowing down, with sales projected to increase by double-digits over the next few years. Anheuser-Busch's continued investment in the craft beer market puts it in a strong position to capitalize on this trend and remain at the forefront of the beer industry. In conclusion, Anheuser-Busch's latest acquisition is a strategic move to position itself as a leader in the craft beer market. The acquisition will provide the company with access to a growing segment of the beer market, while allowing the craft brewer to retain its identity and independence. As the craft beer industry continues to grow, Anheuser-Busch's investment in this space positions it to capitalize on the trend and remain competitive in the ever-evolving beer market.","Anheuser-Busch InBev NV said Wednesday that it is buying Los Angeles-based brewery Golden Road Brewing, the beer giant's latest effort to tap into the growing demand for craft beers. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed. AB InBev, the world's largest beer company with brands like Budweiser and Bud Light, has made a concerted push over the last several years to catch up with American consumers, who increasingly are trading mild-flavored lagers like Bud Light for more flavorful India Pale Ales and porters made by craft breweries. Golden Road road is the largest craft brewery in Los Angeles. Its beers include Point the Way IPA, Wolf Among Weeds IPA, Golden Road Hefeweizen and a collection of seasonal brews. The company, which sells both canned and draft beers, expects to sell 45,000 barrels of beer this year. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of the year. The deal is AB InBev's fifth craft-brewery acquisition since 2011. AB InBev bought its first craft brewer in 2011, paying $38.8 million for Chicago-based Goose Island. It has also picked up Patchogue, N.Y.-based Blue Point Brewing Co., Bend, Ore.-based 10 Barrel, and Seattle-based Elysian Brewing Co. The Golden Road acquisition will give AB InBev a foothold in the growing Los Angeles craft beer market. Golden Road sold approximately 45,000 barrels of beer in 2015. Recent brewery acquisitions have priced craft brewers at more than $1,000 a barrel. Craft's share of the U.S. beer market has more than doubled over the past decade to 9%, while share for mainstream beers like Budweiser and Miller Lite have fallen to 77% from 86%, according to industry tracker Beer Marketer's Insights. Imported beer makes up the rest of the market. The Golden Road deal is the third craft deal this month. MillerCoors LLC, a joint venture between SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Co., recently announced a deal for San Diego-based Saint Archer. Dutch Brewer Heineken NV said earlier this month it took a 50% stake in Lagunitas Brewing, the sixth-largest independent brewer in the U.S. The deal comes as AB InBev pursues beverage-maker SABMiller PLC, a bold move that, if successful, would create a brewing giant that would dominate much of the global beer market. A deal would allow the new beer behemoth to take big mainstream brands like Budweiser and Stella Artois, which have been languishing in key markets, into new corners of the globe. The deal could also help the two brewers resist the growing popularity of craft beers. SABMiller has said that its board ""will review and respond as appropriate to any proposal which might be made.""

44,"A new report has found that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from landfills in the United States have been underestimated. According to the report, the current estimation of methane emissions from landfills in the United States is only a fraction of what is actually being emitted. The report, which was commissioned by the Environmental Defense Fund, found that current estimates of methane emissions from landfills in the United States are underestimating by 90 percent. Methane is a potent GHG, with a global warming potential that is 28 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 100-year time frame. The study used advanced monitoring techniques, including drone technology and satellite remote sensing, to measure methane emissions from landfills across the country. It found that emissions from landfills were significantly higher than previously thought, with some landfills emitting up to six times more methane than estimated. Landfills are one of the largest sources of methane emissions in the United States, accounting for around 15 percent of all methane emissions. Methane is generated in landfills as organic waste decomposes in the absence of oxygen. This process, known as anaerobic digestion, produces methane as a byproduct, which is then released into the atmosphere. The report highlights the urgent need to reduce methane emissions from landfills in the United States. Methane emissions from landfills are a major contributor to climate change, and reducing these emissions is crucial if we are to meet our climate targets. There are several ways to reduce methane emissions from landfills. One approach is to increase the capture and use of landfill gas, which is generated when methane is produced in landfills. Capturing and using landfill gas as a fuel source can reduce methane emissions and generate renewable energy. Another approach is to reduce the amount of waste that is sent to landfills. This can be achieved through increased recycling and the promotion of waste reduction strategies, such as composting and source reduction. The report also calls for greater transparency and monitoring of methane emissions from landfills. Many landfills are not required to report their methane emissions, which makes it difficult to accurately quantify the scale of the problem. In conclusion, the findings of this report are a wake-up call for policymakers and waste management companies. It is clear that we need to take urgent action to reduce methane emissions from landfills if we are to address the urgent challenges of climate change. By increasing the capture and use of landfill gas, promoting waste reduction strategies, and improving transparency and monitoring, we can reduce methane emissions from landfills and build a more sustainable future.","Boston News.Net Monday 21st September, 2015 WASHINGTON - Landfill disposal rates in the US at 262 million tonnes a year in 2012 is more than double what has been estimated by the federal Environmental Protection Agency, according to a study by three US environmental scientists. The study report published Monday in Nature Climate Change, states that the volume of waste in landfills, a major source of the potent greenhouse gas methane, was grossly underestimated in the United States in 2012. Landfill disposal of municipal solid waste represents one of the largest anthropogenic global methane emission sources. Recent policy approaches have targeted significant reduction of these emissions to combat climate change in the US. The study found that as against 122 million tons of garbage estimated to have been dumped in 2012 by the EPA, there was around 262 million tons of garbage dumped in landfills that year, the environmental scientists wrote. ""This suggested that methane emissions, from the decomposition of municipal waste at these dumps, was also undercounted,"" the report states. The scientists claimed to have used a different methodology which was the ""most accurate for the US so far"" than the EPA. The efficacy of active gas collection systems in the US was also examined by the scientists by analyzing performance data, including fire occurrence, from more than 850 landfills. The study's primary goal was to learn more about the efficiency of methane capture systems at landfills, which are more effective after a landfill stops accepting new waste, said study co-author Jon T. Powell, a Yale doctoral student. ""When a landfill reaches the end of its life, an engineered cap or barrier system is installed to seal off the waste material from the environment,"" Powell said. ""Open landfills typically have some areas that are 'closed' in this manner, but also have areas that do not have permanent caps, and it is more difficult to extract methane and other gases that are generated in these areas."" The study found that gas collection systems at closed landfills were significantly more efficient and on average 17 percentage points more efficient than those at open landfills, but open landfills were found to represent 91 percent of all landfill methane emissions. ""These results demonstrate the clear need to target open landfills to achieve significant near-term methane emission reductions,"" states the report. Landfills represent the third-largest, man-made source of methane in the United States -- about 18 percent of domestic emissions, according to the report. Methane lives for a shorter time in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), the most abundant greenhouse gas (GHG), but traps far more of the heat radiated from Earth's surface. The scientists calculated that the average rate of landfill waste disposal was increasing at a rate of about 0.3 percent per year. The underestimation of the waste disposal and the emission in the United States has raised the spectre of similar miscalculations in the rest of the world. ""A high reliance on land filling has been observed in the EU (European Union) and in developing nations, similar to the US,"" wrote the researchers. ""Improving the collection of LFG at open landfills, must be a target for policymakers, researchers and practitioners to achieve near-term GHG emission reductions in the waste sector."""
45,"The Department of Human Services (DHS) appears to be locked in a war of words with the Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) ahead of their upcoming wage poll. With both sides clashing on various issues, the department is now trying its best to win over the hearts and minds of its employees amidst the heated debate. A spokesperson for DHS recently stated that the current wage offer of 2% per annum over three years is ""better than nothing"", a message that has been met with mixed reactions amongst its workforce. Many employees are dissatisfied with the offer, with the CPSU claiming that it doesn't match up to the increasing cost of living. The department's spokesperson, however, is standing by their statement. ""The government has made it clear that they can't afford to meet the CPSU's demands,"" the spokesperson stated. ""We believe our offer is fair, and we hope to convince our employees that it's the best deal they're going to get."" Meanwhile, the CPSU remains adamant about its demands for a better wage offer. According to the union, DHS employees have been suffering from inadequate pay for quite some time, and the 2% proposal isn't enough to cover the rising costs of living in Australia. The union is also calling for the removal of clauses related to cuts in penalty rates, which they believe will only further harm employees. ""At the end of the day, our union is all about fighting for fair wages and working conditions for our members,"" said CPSU National Secretary, Nadine Flood. ""We want DHS employees to know that they have the power to demand more, and we're here to support them every step of the way."" As the wage debate rages on, DHS is relying on its ""better than nothing"" message to win over its employees. The department has been sending out regular communications to its staff members, outlining the benefits of the proposed deal and encouraging them to accept it. In a recent internal memo, DHS stated, ""We know that times are tough, and we understand the concerns that our employees have. However, we believe that the government's offer is the best one on the table, and we hope that our employees will join us in supporting it."" With the wage poll just around the corner, it remains to be seen which side will emerge victorious. However, the DHS is certainly putting up a strong fight, battling for the hearts and minds of its workforce with a clear message of ""better than nothing"". Only time will tell whether this message will resonate with employees, or whether the CPSU's demands for better pay and working conditions will ultimately prevail.","The APS's largest department is battling to win hearts and minds. With very simple mathematics. More public service newsDHS wage showdown loomsTax Office offers front-loaded pay deal The federal government's largest department, Human Services, is battling to win the hearts and minds of its 34,000 public servants before they begin voting Friday on a new wage offer. Workers at the giant department are being told that 1.5 per cent pay offer is better than a 0.00 per cent pay offer as management hammers its message with a ""get the facts"" poster blitz. Public servants at DHS sites around Australia arrived at work on Thursday to be confronted with ""Vote-Yes"" screensavers on their computers as management pull out all the stops ahead of the poll. Meantime at the Australian Taxation Office, bosses are battling just to get a ballot up and running as unions take their grievances with the process to the industrial umpire. Campaigning at DHS is reaching fever pitch with the department's senior management and their adversaries in the Community and Public Sector Union blitzing Centrelink, Medicare and Child Support Agency workplaces around the nation with their campaign posters. Better than nothing? tell us what you think at ps@canberratimes.com.au Senior management at the department want to see an end to the troubled bargaining process which has been dogging the department since early 2014 but are up against a determined CPSU effort in the most heavily unionised federal department. The boss's message urges public servants to ""get the facts"", arguing their offer of 1.5 per cent over three years is the ""best pay offer around"". ""1.5% is better than 00.0%, that's a fact!"" the poster declares. ""Low pay offer? It's the best pay offer around and that's a fact too!"" In its response, the CPSU is using the image of public service minister Eric Abetz who the union believes is one of its best assets as it works for the large no-vote it needs to maintain the momentum for its campaign against the Abbott government's public sector wage policies. One poster depicts the minister pushing down on rights, conditions, wages and jobs while another highlights the improvements to the offer that have already been made in the face of the wholesale rejection of earlier proposals. Voting begins on Friday and ends on Thursday, September 10. Meantime at the Australian Taxation Office, unions have applied to the Fair Work Commission for ""bargaining orders"" forcing Tax Office bosses to disclose more information before a vote on their wage offer is held. Senior management are keen to hold a ballot of their 18,000 public servants . But the Australian Services Union, backed by the CPSU, says it needs to know more about Commissioner Jordan's plans for productivity improvements and cost savings between this financial year and 2018-2019. But the ATO's human resources boss Geoff Leeper say he wants to go to a ballot as soon as possible. ""We think that is fair and reasonable after more than 12 months of negotiations,"" Mr Leeper told workers on Wednesday. The ATO is seeking a fast-tracked resolution to the dispute from the FWC. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald."

47,"In 2011, a group of Iowans attempted to draft New Jersey Governor Chris Christie into the presidential race. Although he ultimately decided against running in 2012, that effort has not gone unnoticed by the governor. As Christie prepares for his own 2016 campaign, those same Iowans are now offering him their support. The group, known as Iowans for Christie, was formed in 2011 by a group of Republican activists who believed that Christie would make a strong presidential candidate. The effort gained momentum quickly, with over 4,000 Facebook followers and fundraising efforts that raised several thousand dollars. Despite the support from Iowans and others, Christie ultimately announced that he would not be running in the 2012 campaign. He cited his commitment to his job in New Jersey as the main reason for his decision. But the support of Iowans for Christie did not fade away. In fact, many of the same activists who were involved in the 2011 effort are now offering their support for Christie's 2016 campaign. One of those activists is Tamara Scott, a member of the Republican National Committee from Iowa. She was a driving force behind the 2011 draft effort and is now serving as chair of Iowans for Christie. ""Governor Christie has been a great friend to Iowa over the years, and we think he would make an excellent president,"" Scott said in a recent interview. ""We're excited to support him and help him win the nomination."" Another member of the group, Jeff Jorgensen, said that Christie's leadership was what initially drew him to the governor. Jorgensen is now serving as a co-chair of Iowans for Christie. ""Governor Christie is someone who knows how to get things done, and that's what we need in a president,"" Jorgensen said. ""He's been a leader on issues like education reform and fiscal responsibility, and we think he would be a great president."" Christie has already made several trips to Iowa in recent months, including a speech at the Iowa Freedom Summit in January. Although he has not officially announced his candidacy for president, many believe that he is laying the groundwork for a campaign. Christie's popularity in Iowa could be key to his success in the 2016 campaign. The state is considered a crucial early contest in the presidential race, and winning its caucuses can provide a boost to a candidate's momentum. For Iowans for Christie, supporting the governor's campaign is a way to continue the work they started in 2011. ""We believe in Chris Christie and his vision for America,"" said Scott. ""We're going to work hard to make sure he's the next president of the United States.""","DES MOINES, Iowa — He's behind in the polls and has spent little time in Iowa of late, but Chris Christie is set to get a major bump in the leadoff caucus state with endorsements from nearly all of the local Republican heavyweights who tried to recruit him to run four years ago. Six of the seven big-money donors and activists who flew to New Jersey to urge the Republican governor to run in the 2012 race plan to formally endorse Christie in Des Moines Tuesday. The news was first reported by The Des Moines Register. ""What we've looked at and come around to is similar thoughts as in 2011,"" said Bruce Rastetter, a major GOP donor who made his fortune in the pork and ethanol industries. ""We need blunt, bold leadership. We need somebody that can actually govern."" Of the seven who hopped aboard the private plane to the East coast in 2011, two have long been vocal supporters and one has said he would not endorse because he works for an elected official. Getting the majority to publicly endorse Christie is a boon for his campaign. He has struggled to compete in a crowded field that includes attention-grabbing front-runner Donald Trump. ""Whatever he needs, we're going to be behind him,"" said real estate developer Gary Kirke, who said the group wanted to stick together. His backers think his chances are improving after strong debate performances and with two governors — Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry —now out of the race. Now Rastetter said he hopes the endorsements will send a message to Iowa Republicans, that they should ""give him another look."" Christie held a town hall meeting with Rastetter Monday night, telling the crowd gathered in a cavernous barn that ""you'll always know how hard I'm willing to fight for you."" He declined to talk about the endorsements in advance of the Tuesday press conference. The trip this week marks his ninth to the leadoff caucus state this year. Christie, who has focused more heavily on New Hampshire, has spent less time here than many other contenders, though he put in a marathon day at the Iowa State Fair in August and has a well-regarded team, with respected operatives Phil Valenziano and Jeffrey Boeyink. Campaign aides said Christie will be ramping up his visits to the state in the fall. Mikel Derby, who works for the state's transportation department and who was part of the Christie recruitment effort in 2011, said there is still time for Christie to do well. ""History is littered with the Bachmanns and Walkers who are superstars real early. There's no purpose in peaking in August and September,"" said Derby, who has been with Christie all along. Still, while these endorsements matter, most agree Christie will still have to invest more time in Iowa. Republican State Rep. Chip Baltimore, who has not endorsed a candidate, said there was no substitute for retail politicking. ""If he is not here, he will not do well,"" Baltimore said. ""Gov. Christie, when he talks to people and meets people, is very persuasive. People walk away from that generally feeling positive toward him."""

50,"The Volkswagen scandal, which saw the German car manufacturer using illegal software to cheat in emissions tests sparking the biggest crisis in its 78-year history, will have personnel consequences, according to the German State Economy Minister, Martin Dulig. ""The company culture has to change, and for that you need people who embody and lead that culture,"" Dulig told the German newspaper, Handelsblatt. ""I expect personnel consequences."" As previously reported, Volkswagen has created a new unit, headed by Audi's head of development, Stefan Knirsch, aimed at coordinating work on engine development across the group's twelve automotive brands. The move is part of Volkswagen's effort to overcome the scandal. However, it remains to be seen whether the creation of this new unit will be enough to satisfy the authorities, given mounting reports that the emissions scandal was more widespread than initially thought.","FRANKFURT: Heads are certain to roll at Volkswagen once it becomes clear who at the German carmaker was responsible for the falsification of emissions tests of diesel-powered vehicles in the United States, a German politician and VW supervisory board member said on Tuesday. ""I am sure that there will be personnel consequences in the end, there is no question about it,"" the German state of Lower Saxony's Economy Minister Olaf Lies told German radio station Deutschlandfunk in an interview. But he said a thorough investigation would first have to identify the person or people who were involved in the issue. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said on Friday that Volkswagen used software that deceived regulators measuring toxic emissions and could face penalties of up to $18 billion. The news had sent the company's stock down by nearly 20 percent on Monday."

52,"As the world becomes more conscious of the impact that our daily activities have on the environment, energy regulations continue to evolve. The latest wave of new rules has left many residents wondering how they will be impacted by them. While some are applauding these measures, others are concerned that they will leave people in the dark - both literally and metaphorically. In a recent meeting of local officials, differing opinions were expressed about how to move forward with these new regulations. Some proposed more stringent revisions, while others proposed softer guidelines. As the discussion continued, it became clear that the debate requires a balanced approach that considers the needs of both the environment and the people who rely on energy for their daily needs. A key issue that came up repeatedly in the meeting was the potential impact on residents. Many feel that they are already struggling to make ends meet, and that additional costs associated with new energy regulations will make it difficult for them to afford basic necessities like food and housing. The proposed regulations include a variety of measures aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions, which many see as a necessity in the face of climate change. These include reducing the use of fossil fuels, promoting renewable energy sources like wind and solar, and improving energy efficiency in buildings. While these measures are undoubtedly positive steps towards a sustainable future, some residents are worried about the potential impact on their wallets. Many feel that they simply cannot afford to switch to renewable energy sources or invest in energy-efficient appliances and home improvements. Another concern expressed by some residents is the potential for disruptions to energy supply. While the new regulations may ultimately lead to a more stable and reliable energy grid, the transition period could be rocky - and many worry about being left without power in the interim. Of course, there are also those who are fully supportive of the new regulations. They see them as necessary steps towards a cleaner and more sustainable future, and are willing to make the necessary investments to help bring this about. One proposal put forward at the meeting was a system of incentives to encourage residents to switch to more energy-efficient practices. This could include tax breaks for companies that invest in renewable energy, subsidies for homeowners who purchase energy-efficient appliances, and other measures designed to make the transition easier for everyone. While this proposal has some merit, there are concerns that it may not be enough to sway residents who are already struggling from the effects of COVID-19 and the economic downturn it has caused. Many feel that the government should be doing more to support them during this difficult time, rather than imposing additional regulations that could make life even more challenging. Ultimately, the decision on how to move forward with new energy regulations will require a careful balancing of multiple factors. While it is important to continue progressing towards a cleaner, more sustainable future, it is equally important to ensure that residents are not left behind in the process. As the conversation continues, it is crucial that officials and residents work together to find a way forward that takes everyone's needs into account. Only by doing so can we truly create a brighter and more sustainable future for all.","When new federal regulations kick in this year to reduce power plant emissions, a statewide energy crisis could loom.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is calling for a 32 percent reduction by 2030. In order to get there, several coal plants across Michigan will begin to close this year.In all, nine plants are expected to close over the next two years, with nothing currently planned to replace the energy they produce.Two units at the Trenton Channel Power Plant are among those that will close, along with two more south of the Downriver area at the J.R. Whiting plant near Luna Pier.DTE spokeswoman Randi Berris told The News-Herald Newspapers last year that the decision to close the units was a direct result of the new EPA regulations.“The decision was made because of new federal emissions' regulations taking effect in the next few years, and because of DTE’s focus on reducing customers' rates and maintaining competitive electric rates in the future,"" Berris said.The Wyandotte Municipal Power Plant uses a combination of ways to generate power, coal burning among them. The plant wasn’t on a shutdown list provided by the state of Michigan.No one from the plant was available to talk by press time for this report.Seven of the plants are owned by Consumers Energy and generate more than 950 megawatts of electricity. Overall, more than 1.3 daily gigawatts of power will need to be replaced after the plants all close.That amount would be enough to run Detroit, Grand Rapids and Lansing each day.Consumers Energy officials said they're doing their best to stretch resources to provide electricity to the state’s residents. Those efforts include reopening a Dearborn power plant and the $155 million purchase of the Juniper power plant in Jackson.""You can't store electricity, so it's important to try and have a surplus of it,"" John Russell, president and CEO of Jackson-based Consumers Energy, said in a statement. ""When customers hit the switch, they're either going to have it or they're not.""Both political parties in the state have ideas on how to change regulations to help figure out the looming crisis.The GOP plan recently was released by Sen. Mike Nofs (R-Battle Creek), who chairs the state Senate Energy and Technology Committee.“This legislation represents hundreds of hours’ worth of research, discussion and input from numerous individuals, groups and organizations, including the governor, committee members and the 37-member workgroup I appointed last year,” Nofs said. “These bills represent a starting point for a thorough committee process that will ultimately help us craft the best policy to respond to a rapidly changing landscape for energy.”The Democrats' side is spearheaded by state Rep. Bill Lavoy (D-Monroe) and state Sen. Hoon-Young Hopgood (D-Taylor).“Through 2014, renewable energy projects have brought nearly $3 billion in investment to Michigan, and utilities are on track to meet the 10 percent goal required in current law,” LaVoy said. “As long as renewable energy remains economically viable, the percentage of power generation should increase. Additionally, increasing Michigan-based generation keeps jobs and investment in Michigan.”State Sen. David Knezek (D-Dearborn Heights) and state Rep. Julie Plawecki (D-Dearborn Heights) also are working on the Democratic side of the aisle.The two plans are quite different.Nofs' plan calls for revamping the current integrated resource planning process to change the way utility companies are evaluated. The Republican plan hasn’t been well publicized since it officially was unveiled July 1.The Democratic plan has been on display and talked about since early March. It calls for an increase in support for clean energy-type businesses, with more focus on wind and solar energy companies.“We want to encourage companies to spend here in Michigan,” Knezek said. “Right now, there isn’t anything that restricts out- of-state buying of power. We don’t want that to remain unregulated.”Plawecki echoed those thoughts. She said if Michigan encourages companies to produce energy within the state, it will increase jobs and ultimately help the local economy.Since Michigan passed a renewable energy bill in 2008, more than $5 billion a year have been pumped into the state economy. About $3 billion of that has been invested by private-sector firms.Small-business owners claim the GOP plan for energy production moving forward will put a stop to much of that growth.“The Nofs' plan slams the brakes on Michigan’s clean energy sector, which has been a huge success, supporting 20,500 jobs and $5 billion in annual economic activity,” Mark Cryderman, business development/education manager of the Green Panel, said in a statement. “Polling consistently shows overwhelming support for increasing Michigan’s use of clean energy and the Michigan Legislature should be increasing our clean energy standards, not repealing them.”The Green Panel is a Brighton-based solar company that employs 30 people.State Rep. Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Twp.), who co-authored much of the GOP plan, is against the changes at the federal level, but said he believes its plan is the best bet for the state.“The mandate that is being forced upon Michigan and the rest of the states by the federal government is an unprecedented overreach that will hinder job growth and raise energy rates on hardworking taxpayers,"" Nesbitt said in a statement. “We need an energy plan for the future that ensures reliability and efficiency, while being cost-effective for Michigan families.“The energy proposal I unveiled earlier this year is structured to take an ‘all of the above’ approach that considers each of those elements, rather than a narrow, cookie-cutter approach that picks winners and losers.”Hopgood believes the Democrats' plan is the way to go, both for clean energy and economic growth in the state.“This plan is pro-business, pro-consumer and pro-environment,"" he said. ""Michigan has the potential to be a leader in renewable energy and create thousands of jobs for hardworking men and women across the state. That’s why it’s crucial that we act this year. With these energy principles, my Democratic colleagues and I are ready to get to work.”There is overwhelming public support for increasing renewable energy and energy efficiency, according to a poll conducted by the Michigan Conservative Energy Forum in late 2013. Among the findings, the poll showed that more than 75 percent strongly support an increased renewable portfolio standard and 84 percent support more energy efficiency programs. The support extended to self-identified conservative voters.“With such strong public support from both ends of the political spectrum, it’s clear that this plan is the right way forward for Michigan’s energy sector and our economy,” LaVoy said. “I look forward to working with my Republican colleagues to put these guidelines into action and create jobs while saving residents' money.”According to a report from The Hill Group, a renewable portfolio standard increase would generate as much as $6 billion in economic activity and create tens of thousands of jobs. The Michigan Public Service Commission noted that in 2012 every dollar utilities spent on energy efficiency saved consumers an estimated $3.83 in reduced energy costs."
53,"The Department of Transportation (DOT) is set to test an experimental program that would allow trucks to make overnight deliveries in select cities across the country. The goal of the program is to reduce congestion and improve efficiency on our nation's highways. Starting on September 29th, the program will launch in three cities: New York, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. Trucks participating in the program will be allowed to make deliveries between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., a time when traffic is much lighter. The program is known as the Off-Hours Delivery (OHD) program and is being run by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The FHWA hopes the program will reduce delivery times and lower transportation costs for companies that choose to participate. In addition, the program is expected to reduce pollution and improve quality of life for residents in the cities where it is being tested. While overnight deliveries are not a new concept, the OHD program is unique in that it requires companies to work with local officials to develop a plan for delivering goods during off-hours. Companies will need to work with local officials to determine the best times and routes for deliveries, as well as how to minimize disruptions to residents and businesses. “This is a great example of how the public and private sectors can work together to develop innovative solutions that benefit everyone,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. The OHD program is voluntary, but companies that choose to participate will be required to report their results to the FHWA. The agency will then use this information to evaluate the success of the program and determine if it should be expanded to other cities. Trucking companies and industry groups have been pushing for initiatives like the OHD program for some time. They argue that by allowing trucks to make deliveries during off-hours, they can reduce the number of trucks on the road during peak traffic hours, which in turn can reduce congestion and improve the overall safety of our highways. The FHWA hopes that the OHD program will be a success and that it will lay the groundwork for more effective transportation policies in the future.","Here are five things worth knowing today: 1. New York City and Pensacola, FL, will test overnight truck deliveries in a new U.S. Department of Transportation pilot program to help reduce congestion on city streets. DOT believes that lighter commuter traffic and more available parking overnight will make delivery easier for truck drivers. DOT plans to use grants totaling $200,000 to test its theories in the two pilot cities. If the pilot is successful, DOT said it believes a similar approach could be adopted in other areas of the country. 2. Paul Trombino III, Iowa DOT director, has been elected president of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the association announced. AASHTO also elected David Bernhardt, commission of Maine’s DOT, as its vice president. According to AASHTO, Trombino plans to continue pursuing the association’s policy priorities, including Congressional action on a new transportation bill. Trombino said his primary focus will be ensuring the association is well positioned to serve its member departments. 3. USA Truck has appointed Martin Tewari as its president of trucking , Market Watch reports. Tewari will be responsible for the company’s trucking operations, pricing and sales. He will report to the company’s president and CEO Tom Glaser. According to the report, Tewari has more than 25 years of experience in the transportation industry and he joins USA Truck from Con-way Truckload, where he served as vice president of operations. 4. According to a report in the American Journal of Transportation, Absolute Worldwide Logistics announced that it has acquired online trucking portal Shipmymachinery.com. The report states that the online portal provides transportation lead generation services relating to capital equipment and machinery to the transportation industry throughout North America. 5. A group of rest stops in Indiana will be demolished and closed under The Indiana Toll Road’s new plan for its 10 rest stops , according to NWI Times. According to the report, under a $30 million plan to upgrade rest stops, the easternmost stops in Steuben County will be eliminated and those in Rolling Prairie and Howe will be demolished and rebuilt into full-service travel plazas with gas stations, convenience stores and restaurants.

56,"Scotland Rugby World Cup preview: Lamont’s desire still burning strong Veteran Scotland winger Sean Lamont has declared his intention to retire after the upcoming Rugby World Cup. But before he hangs up his boots, the 35-year-old has one last burning desire: to make an impact on the biggest stage of them all. Lamont is one of the most experienced players in the Scotland squad, having made his debut way back in 2004. He has played in three World Cups already and is hoping to add to his 107 caps this year in Japan. Speaking to the London Evening Standard, Lamont said: “I’ve always said that I’ll retire on my own terms, and this is right for me. But before that, I want to give it everything I’ve got at the World Cup. “It’s always been a dream of mine to play in a World Cup and I’m lucky enough to be going to my fourth one. I know this is my last shot at it, and that’s why my desire is burning stronger than ever.” Scotland start their World Cup campaign against Ireland on 22 September before facing Samoa, Russia and Japan in their remaining Pool A fixtures. Despite finishing third in last year’s Six Nations, they will have their work cut out to progress to the knockout stages. Lamont, however, is confident that Scotland can make an impact. “We’ve got a good mix of youth and experience in our squad,” he said. “There’s a real sense of excitement and energy, and everyone’s looking forward to getting out there and playing. “We’ve got a tough pool, but we’re not afraid of anyone. We’ve played some of the best teams in the world over the last few years and we’ve shown that we can compete at that level. “There’s no reason why we can’t go out there and really make a statement.” One of the key factors in Scotland’s success will be the form of their captain, Stuart McInally. The hooker has been in fine form for club and country over the past 12 months and will be crucial to Scotland’s set piece and breakdown play. Lamont also singled out the exciting young backline as another reason for optimism. “We’ve got some fantastic talent in our backline,” he said. “Players like Finn Russell, Huw Jones and Stuart Hogg can really light up a game and create something out of nothing. “If we can give those guys a platform to play off, then we could be a real force in this tournament.” As for his own contribution, Lamont is focusing on being a positive influence on the younger members of the squad. “I’ve been in this game a long time and I’ve seen pretty much everything there is to see,” he said. “Hopefully, I can use that experience to help some of the younger guys in the squad. Whether that’s on the field or off it, I want to be a positive influence and help them to perform at their best.” With the World Cup just around the corner, Lamont’s desire to make an impact is clear for all to see. Whether Scotland can progress beyond the pool stages remains to be seen, but with the experienced winger in their ranks, they will be a team no one will want to face.","With almost a century of caps to his name, Sean Lamont is the old dog of Scottish rugby who believes he has learned enough tricks to keep on barking. But the Glasgow Warrior insists he will be worried if he is not chased out of the side by one of the Dark Blues' young pups. The 34-year-old made his 96th appearance for his country in Saturday's Test against Italy, scoring two tries in the 48-7 Murrayfield rout. It was one step closer to that elusive third figure that will make him just the second Scot after Chris Paterson to have collected 100 caps. But while some may view this year's World Cup in England as a perfect opportunity for Lamont to bow out on a high - especially coming just four months after lifting the first major honour of a 15-year professional career with Glasgow's Guinness PRO12 triumph - the Perth-born back insists he is not interested in exit strategies. In fact, he even wryly joked about the prospect of playing on until the next tournament in Japan in four years' time. But that is only if he is not hounded out by the young pretenders. ""I will never retire,"" said Lamont. ""I've got a contract with Glasgow for next year, but I think I'll ask to go again once it ends. ""The desire is still there, the body is holding out and, provided I'm wanted, I will keep going. Five classic Rugby World Cup Matches ""So I have no plans to call it a day after this World Cup. Could I keep going until the next one in 2019? Well if I was still playing by then I'd be worried. ""I'd be asking myself, 'Where the hell are all the young wingers?' ""I'd be over the moon if I was still around this team by 2019, but I hope to God there is someone coming along to take my place. ""We've got the likes of Damien Hoyland, Rory Hughes and Dougie Fife coming through, so there are plenty of boys about. ""But I won't retire. Someone will retire me, but it won't be my decision."" Lamont has been to the last two World Cups but, while the tournament is the pinnacle for many, his memories are only filled with regret. In 2007 the Scots looked set for a semi-final slot until Argentina robbed them of the chance. The Pumas then roared louder again four years later as Andy Robinson's side failed to even make it out of their group. The Scots are now gearing up for crucial clashes with Japan, America, South Africa and Samoa in Pool B, and Lamont wants his team to learn from the mistakes of the past. He said: ""Both my previous World Cup experiences were a bit of a disappointment, if I'm being frankly honest. ""I loved going and it was great to be part of it. But in 2007 we blew the chance to make a semi-final, which would have been incredible. ""We should have beat Argentina in the quarters. We played all the rugby but didn't see out the win. That's why it was such a pain in the bum. ""Then last time around we didn't even make it out the group, which was disgraceful. ""The alarm bells were ringing in the first two games against Romania and Georgia when we struggled against both. We then had the Argentina game all but wrapped up and a 30-second lapse of concentration cost us the game. ""That left us having to beat a tough England side by 14 points, which was a big ask at any time, never mind in a World Cup. ""So I'm acutely aware of the fact that every pool game we play has got to be top notch. ""We can't just focus on South Africa in the third game as the important one. We're not that good. We're good, but just look at the defeat to Tonga in Aberdeen a couple of years ago. That could happen again if we don't go in with the right attitude."""

The exciting winger, who is rated at £25 million, has been on the radar of several top European clubs, but he has now confirmed that Chelsea is his preferred destination. Brandt, who currently plays for Borussia Dortmund in the German Bundesliga, has had a strong season, recording 4 goals and 10 assists in the league.

The German was signed by Mourinho in 2013 from Bayer Leverkusen but he failed to make an impact under the Special one and was ultimately sold. Now he has claimed the Portuguese manager never fully trusted him. “I had a good time at Chelsea and was accepted in the team, so it’s difficult to explain why I left,” he said. “I don’t know why Mourinho didn’t trust me. It all felt a bit weird to me. I started a few games, was on the bench for a few, then started some more. “It was up and down the whole time.

59,"The Ghanaian government has issued a stern warning to all assemblies across the country to reduce their expenditure or face the possibility of serious consequences. The warning comes amidst reports of widespread financial mismanagement across the various assemblies in the country. In a statement released by the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, the government expressed its concern over the unsustainable financial practices being carried out by many assemblies in the country. The statement noted that many assemblies were spending beyond their means and were accumulating huge debts that would be difficult to pay off. The Ministry further pointed out that this reckless spending was having serious consequences on the delivery of essential services to the people. The Ministry cited cases of unpaid salaries, delayed projects, and inadequate provision of basic services such as water, health, and education in many parts of the country. The government has therefore directed all assemblies to review their budgets and cut down on expenses that are not essential to their operations. The Ministry has also directed all assemblies to step up efforts to generate revenue internally to supplement the funding they receive from the central government. In addition, the government has warned that it will not hesitate to take action against any assemblies that continue to spend recklessly and accumulate debts that they cannot pay. The government has indicated that this could include sanctions such as the suspension of funding or even the removal of officials found to be responsible for the financial mismanagement. The warning by the government has been welcomed by many Ghanaians who have long been concerned about the state of financial management in the various assemblies. Many have called for greater transparency and accountability in the use of public funds, and for strong action to be taken against those who break the law. However, some have also raised concerns about the potential impact of the government's warning on the delivery of essential services. They have pointed out that many assemblies are already struggling to provide basic services due to a lack of funding and resources, and that any further cuts could exacerbate the situation. The government has acknowledged these concerns but has reiterated its commitment to ensuring that essential services are delivered to the people. The Ministry has indicated that the government is working on a comprehensive plan to address the funding challenges facing many assemblies and to ensure that essential services are not compromised. In conclusion, the warning by the government to assemblies to reduce their expenditure is a welcome development that should help to promote greater accountability in the use of public funds. However, it is important that the government works closely with the assemblies to ensure that this does not lead to further cuts in essential services or other unintended consequences. Ultimately, the goal should be to promote sustainable financial practices that ensure the effective delivery of services to the people of Ghana.","Government has issued a directive to Municipal and Districts Assemblies (MDAs) to be circumspect in their spending as it makes adjustment to expected revenue from the export of crude oil. Finance Minister Seth Tekpeh The directive means that most of the country’s MDAs who rely on government for funding would have to alter their expenditure pattern or devise legitimate means of generating internal fund to supplement their operations. Issuing the directive, Finance Minister Mr. Seth Terkper cautioned local government heads not to engage in unplanned expenditures to help maintain the medium term fiscal consolidation objectives of the government. “In this regard, MDAs that are funded from the Annual Budget Funding Amount (ABFA) are to control their expenditure within the Budget allotments provided by the Ministry of Finance”, he said. Earlier this year, government reviewed expected revenue from the export of crude oil from 95 US dollars per barrel to 57 US dollars per barrel. However, the fast fall in the price of oil to US 45.70 dollars per barrel means that Ghana’s external source of income will decrease, putting pressure on the national purse. Fiscal deficit reduction Ghana’s 2015 budget aims at reducing the fiscal deficit from 10.2 percent of GDP in 2014 to 7.3 percent of GDP in 2015. There has been two adjustments of the budget deficit mainly on account of crude oil price developments. Preliminary data for the first half of the year indicate that, total revenue and grants was higher than the target for the period. At the same time, total expenditure including the clearance of arrears was lower than target. As a result the cash fiscal deficit for the period was 2.3 percent of GDP against a target of 3.4 percent. This compares to a deficit of 4.3 percent of GDP for the same period in 2014. The total revenue and grants for the period was 11.2 percent of GDP, against a target of 10.6 percent of GDP. In nominal terms, the outturn was 5.4 percent higher than target and 32.9 percent higher than the outturn for the same period in 2014. Ghana’s good performance in total revenue and grants was mainly due to a strong growth in domestic revenue. Tax income Tax revenue amounted to GH¢11,403.9 million, 8.4 percent higher than the Budget target of GH¢10,516.3 million. In nominal terms tax revenue was 32.1 percent higher than the outturn recorded for the same period in 2014. The strong performance in tax revenue was mainly due to the good performance of petroleum taxes, VAT and trade taxes resulting from the imposition of the Special Petroleum Tax and exchange rate depreciation as well as improved revenue administration and efficiency. GDP estimates for first half of 2015 Total expenditure, including payments for the clearance of arrears for the first half of 2015 amounted to GH¢18,068.5 million (13.5 percent of GDP) against a target of GH¢18,805.7 million (equivalent to 14.0 percent of GDP). The outturn was 3.9 percent lower than the budget target but 14.1 percent higher than the outturn for the same period in 2014. The growth in expenditure was mainly due to higher spending on goods and services and foreign financed capital expenditure. The cash fiscal deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP for the period under review was financed mainly from domestic sources, resulting in a Net Domestic Financing (NDF) of the budget of GH¢1. 875.4 million (1.4 percent of GDP). The NDF for the period was 57.3 percent lower than the budget target of GH¢4,395.1 million and 48.6 percent lower than the outturn for the same period in 2014. Foreign Financing of the budget was GH¢1,218.0 million representing 39.4 percent of total financing, against a target of GH¢206.1 million. Thus domestic financing constituted about 60.6 percent of the total financing of the deficit for the first six months of the year."
