0,"The Ghanaian government has issued a stern warning to all assemblies across the country to reduce their expenditure or face the possibility of serious consequences. The warning comes amidst reports of widespread financial mismanagement across the various assemblies in the country. In a statement released by the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, the government expressed its concern over the unsustainable financial practices being carried out by many assemblies in the country. The statement noted that many assemblies were spending beyond their means and were accumulating huge debts that would be difficult to pay off. The Ministry further pointed out that this reckless spending was having serious consequences on the delivery of essential services to the people. The Ministry cited cases of unpaid salaries, delayed projects, and inadequate provision of basic services such as water, health, and education in many parts of the country. The government has therefore directed all assemblies to review their budgets and cut down on expenses that are not essential to their operations. The Ministry has also directed all assemblies to step up efforts to generate revenue internally to supplement the funding they receive from the central government. In addition, the government has warned that it will not hesitate to take action against any assemblies that continue to spend recklessly and accumulate debts that they cannot pay. The government has indicated that this could include sanctions such as the suspension of funding or even the removal of officials found to be responsible for the financial mismanagement. The warning by the government has been welcomed by many Ghanaians who have long been concerned about the state of financial management in the various assemblies. Many have called for greater transparency and accountability in the use of public funds, and for strong action to be taken against those who break the law. However, some have also raised concerns about the potential impact of the government's warning on the delivery of essential services. They have pointed out that many assemblies are already struggling to provide basic services due to a lack of funding and resources, and that any further cuts could exacerbate the situation. The government has acknowledged these concerns but has reiterated its commitment to ensuring that essential services are delivered to the people. The Ministry has indicated that the government is working on a comprehensive plan to address the funding challenges facing many assemblies and to ensure that essential services are not compromised. In conclusion, the warning by the government to assemblies to reduce their expenditure is a welcome development that should help to promote greater accountability in the use of public funds. However, it is important that the government works closely with the assemblies to ensure that this does not lead to further cuts in essential services or other unintended consequences. Ultimately, the goal should be to promote sustainable financial practices that ensure the effective delivery of services to the people of Ghana.","Government has issued a directive to Municipal and Districts Assemblies (MDAs) to be circumspect in their spending as it makes adjustment to expected revenue from the export of crude oil. Finance Minister Seth Tekpeh The directive means that most of the country’s MDAs who rely on government for funding would have to alter their expenditure pattern or devise legitimate means of generating internal fund to supplement their operations. Issuing the directive, Finance Minister Mr. Seth Terkper cautioned local government heads not to engage in unplanned expenditures to help maintain the medium term fiscal consolidation objectives of the government. “In this regard, MDAs that are funded from the Annual Budget Funding Amount (ABFA) are to control their expenditure within the Budget allotments provided by the Ministry of Finance”, he said. Earlier this year, government reviewed expected revenue from the export of crude oil from 95 US dollars per barrel to 57 US dollars per barrel. However, the fast fall in the price of oil to US 45.70 dollars per barrel means that Ghana’s external source of income will decrease, putting pressure on the national purse. Fiscal deficit reduction Ghana’s 2015 budget aims at reducing the fiscal deficit from 10.2 percent of GDP in 2014 to 7.3 percent of GDP in 2015. There has been two adjustments of the budget deficit mainly on account of crude oil price developments. Preliminary data for the first half of the year indicate that, total revenue and grants was higher than the target for the period. At the same time, total expenditure including the clearance of arrears was lower than target. As a result the cash fiscal deficit for the period was 2.3 percent of GDP against a target of 3.4 percent. This compares to a deficit of 4.3 percent of GDP for the same period in 2014. The total revenue and grants for the period was 11.2 percent of GDP, against a target of 10.6 percent of GDP. In nominal terms, the outturn was 5.4 percent higher than target and 32.9 percent higher than the outturn for the same period in 2014. Ghana’s good performance in total revenue and grants was mainly due to a strong growth in domestic revenue. Tax income Tax revenue amounted to GH¢11,403.9 million, 8.4 percent higher than the Budget target of GH¢10,516.3 million. In nominal terms tax revenue was 32.1 percent higher than the outturn recorded for the same period in 2014. The strong performance in tax revenue was mainly due to the good performance of petroleum taxes, VAT and trade taxes resulting from the imposition of the Special Petroleum Tax and exchange rate depreciation as well as improved revenue administration and efficiency. GDP estimates for first half of 2015 Total expenditure, including payments for the clearance of arrears for the first half of 2015 amounted to GH¢18,068.5 million (13.5 percent of GDP) against a target of GH¢18,805.7 million (equivalent to 14.0 percent of GDP). The outturn was 3.9 percent lower than the budget target but 14.1 percent higher than the outturn for the same period in 2014. The growth in expenditure was mainly due to higher spending on goods and services and foreign financed capital expenditure. The cash fiscal deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP for the period under review was financed mainly from domestic sources, resulting in a Net Domestic Financing (NDF) of the budget of GH¢1. 875.4 million (1.4 percent of GDP). The NDF for the period was 57.3 percent lower than the budget target of GH¢4,395.1 million and 48.6 percent lower than the outturn for the same period in 2014. Foreign Financing of the budget was GH¢1,218.0 million representing 39.4 percent of total financing, against a target of GH¢206.1 million. Thus domestic financing constituted about 60.6 percent of the total financing of the deficit for the first six months of the year."

5,"A new recycling technology that promises to be a “game changer” has received a $24 million cash injection from a group of investors. The process, developed by Canadian startup Carbicrete, aims to reduce the amount of concrete waste that ends up in landfills by upcycling it into a valuable product. Traditional concrete production releases large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, but Carbicrete’s technology creates a carbon-negative process by using steel slag and other industrial byproducts as an alternative to traditional cement. The injection from investors including the Quartz Opportunity Fund and GreenSoil Investments will help Carbicrete commercialize its technology on a larger scale, with plans to open a series of plants across North America. According to the company, the process involves using carbon dioxide to cure the concrete rather than water, making it stronger and more durable than traditional concrete. The company also claims that the carbon-negative process can offset up to 90% of the emissions associated with traditional concrete production. The investment in Carbicrete comes as the world’s population booms and cities expand, putting pressure on the construction industry to reduce its carbon footprint. “Carbicrete’s technology has the potential to be a complete game changer in the building materials industry,” said Brian Ostroff, managing director of the Quartz Opportunity Fund. “With the demand for concrete continuing to rise, and the associated carbon footprint that comes with it, we are excited to play a role in bringing a solution like Carbicrete to market.” Carbicrete is not the only company exploring sustainable alternatives to traditional concrete. Last year, Dutch company Green Minerals announced plans to use waste from steelmaking as a replacement for traditional cement. The company launched a pilot project in May involving the construction of a bike path made of its sustainable concrete. The path is expected to be more durable and require less maintenance than traditional concrete. As concerns about the environmental impact of traditional building materials grow, companies are increasingly turning to sustainable alternatives to cement and other materials. The $24 million funding round for Carbicrete shows that investors are starting to recognize the huge potential of this emerging industry. With its innovative technology and plans for expansion, Carbicrete could be at the forefront of a major shift towards sustainable construction in the years to come.","A major plastics recycling plant that will recycle the #3-#7 hard–to–recycle plastics such as yogurt containers and lawn furniture is slated to come online in October, servicing much of the US East Coast, thanks to a multi-million investment by the Closed Loop Fund. The fund has amassed millions of dollars from leading companies — including 3M, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, Goldman Sachs, Johnson & Johnson Family of Consumer Companies, Keurig Green Mountain, PepsiCo and the PepsiCo Foundation, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation — and plans to invest more than $500 million in US recycling projects over the next five years. The to cities and low interest loans to recycling companies. The first three recycling investments total $24 million. Closed Loop Fund’s first investee is a joint venture between QRS and Canusa-Hershman (CHR) to create a one-of-a-kind plastic recovery facility (PRF) in Baltimore, Maryland. Currently, 70 percent of communities across the US are not able to collect and recycle #3-#7 plastics, like yogurt containers and take out packaging or large rigid plastics such as crates, buckets, baskets and lawn furniture. The Closed Loop Fund says tor the first time ever, QRS and CHS will combine technology that can both separate these products and turn them back into raw materials for new products and packaging. The facility is able to process 4,500 tons of materials every month — double the capacity of what’s presently possible in the US. Beginning in October, QRS-CHR will service the majority of the East Coast, from Maine to South Carolina, increasing recycling rates and finally providing a recycling solution for #3-#7 plastics. The fund expects the opening of the facility to help divert 440,000 tons from landfills and reduce 555,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions. Closed Loop Fund’s two other investments are in Quad Cities, Iowa, and Portage County, Ohio, both important Midwest markets for recycling. These investments will allow the two communities to convert from dual-stream recycling systems to single-stream, making it easier for citizens to recycle. These communities are similar to hundreds across the south and Midwest with citizens who want to recycle, but without a convenient option. The fund says over the next 10 years, in Portage County alone, 37,000 tons will be diverted from landfills with a reduction of 110,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions. It expects Quad Cities to see 86,000 tons diverted from landfills and 250,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions reduced. Lack of infrastructure is a major barriers to more recycling in the US. In 2013, lack of recycling infrastructure caused US cities to collectively spend over $5 billion dollars to landfill over $11 billion worth of commodities that could have been recycled, according to the Closed Loop Fund.

6,"President Donald Trump has promised ""major tax relief"" for most Americans as part of his plan to overhaul the tax code. Speaking at a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on April 29, the president outlined his vision for a simpler, fairer tax system that would benefit middle-class families and small businesses. ""We're going to massively lower taxes on the middle class, reduce the tax burden on American businesses, and make our tax code more simple and fair,"" Trump told the cheering crowd. ""We want to make it so that you can file your taxes on a postcard. That's how simple it's going to be."" The president's plan includes cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, eliminating the estate tax (also known as the ""death tax""), and doubling the standard deduction for individuals and families. He also wants to reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three, with rates of 10 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent. The top rate would apply to those earning more than $500,000 a year. Trump argues that these changes would stimulate economic growth, create jobs, and put more money in the pockets of hardworking Americans. ""The current tax code is a disaster,"" he said. ""It's complicated, it's unfair, and it's just plain wrong. It punishes success and rewards failure. We can do better than this, and we will."" Critics, however, say that the president's plan would largely benefit the wealthy and add trillions of dollars to the national debt. They point out that the estate tax only applies to estates worth more than $5.49 million for individuals or $10.98 million for married couples, meaning that only the super-rich would benefit from its elimination. They also argue that cutting the corporate tax rate would primarily benefit shareholders and executives, rather than workers or consumers. ""There's no doubt that the wealthy will benefit the most from this plan,"" said John Podesta, former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton and chair of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. ""It's a massive giveaway to the top 1 percent, and it will lead to deeper inequality and a weaker economy."" Trump's proposal has already faced criticism from some members of his own party, who worry about the impact on the deficit and the potential loss of revenue. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, a Republican and a member of the Senate Budget Committee, has called the plan ""a massive tax cut for the rich disguised as a reform,"" and said that he would oppose it unless it was revenue-neutral. Despite the opposition, the president remains optimistic about the prospects for his tax plan. He has promised to work with Congress to iron out the details and pass a bill by the end of the year. ""We're going to pass the biggest tax cut in history,"" he declared in Pennsylvania. ""And it's going to be a great thing for our country."" For many Americans, the promise of lower taxes is a welcome one. The Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank, estimates that the average family would see a tax cut of $1,600 under Trump's plan, while the top 1 percent of earners would see an average cut of $270,000. Whether the president's plan will be enough to boost the economy and improve the lives of ordinary Americans remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: the debate over tax reform is just beginning, and it promises to be a contentious one.","""It will provide major tax relief for middle income and for most other Americans. There will be a major tax reduction,"" Trump said Monday at a press conference at Trump Tower in New York as he unveiled his plan to revamp the tax code. ""It'll simplify the tax code, it'll grow the American economy at a level that it hasn't seen for decades."" The highly anticipated tax plan comes as Trump is being pressed to provide more details about how his administration would govern. One of the biggest beneficiaries appears to be families that draw the smallest paychecks. Individuals that make less than $25,000 (and $50,000 for married couples) would pay no income taxes under Trump's plan. However, the proposal would also be a boon for the wealthiest Americans like Trump -- the top bracket includes individuals making $150,001 and more and couples making $300,001 and more -- who would pay an income tax rate of 25%. That's a dramatic cut from the current top rate of close to 40%. The tax cuts for top earners could open Trump up to charges of hypocrisy. The real estate magnate has surged to the top of the polls by touting a populist tone, lamenting that wealthy people like himself should pay more. Asked at Monday's press conference how his proposal would affect his own tax rate, Trump dodged the question, saying: ""We're reducing taxes, but believe me, there will be people in the very upper echelon that won't be thrilled with this."" He also declined to say how much taxes he currently pays, only saying, ""I fight like hell to pay as little as possible."" Perhaps the most pressing question that Trump must answer is how he would raise enough revenue to offset his plan's deep tax cuts, though he insisted Monday that his proposal would not add to the country's debt or deficit. The candidate says he would make up for the difference in a number of ways: killing certain deductions for the rich and creating incentives for U.S. companies to bring back cash currently held overseas, thereby boosting growth at home. Trump's tax plan broadly mirrors that of one of his main rivals: Jeb Bush. Bush's proposal released this month also reduces the number of income tax brackets -- to three from the current seven. The highest tax bracket under the former Florida governor's plan is 28%, and the lowest is 10%. Bush also proposed lowering the corporate tax rate from 25% to 20% -- another popular idea among conservatives. Trump would go even further, lowering the rate to 15%. Like Bush, one loophole Trump would target is the preferential treatment for carried interest, which is a share of profits paid to investment managers. Since launching his White House campaign in June, Trump has made sweeping attacks on hedge fund managers who are paid in carried interest. Trump, who claims that his personal assets are valued at more than $10 billion, frequently makes the distinction between investors who work in real estate and those on Wall Street. Hedge fund managers, he often says, fall in the category of special interests backing some of his well-connected and best-funded rivals. ""I know them. They all are supporting Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton,"" Trump told CNN at a campaign stop in Nashville, Tennessee, last month. ""They make a lot of money and a lot of it is luck. They pick a stock and all of a sudden they make a lot of money. I want the hedge fund guys to pay more taxes."" Still, the plan might not be too tough on Wall Street. Since Trump's proposal would slash the income tax rate across the board, taxing carried interest as regular income under Trump's plan would mean investors still pay far less than what they would if the carried interest loophole were done away with under the current tax code. The tax rate of hedge fund managers is a favorite political target for the 2016 presidential candidates. ""We will treat all noninvestment income the same, so unless you stake capital in an investment, you won't be able to claim the capital-gains tax rate on your market gains,"" Bush's tax proposal said. It's also popular rallying cry for the Democratic candidates. Former Secretary of Hillary Clinton has been hitting Wall Street tax breaks since the first days of her campaign, as she's faced pressure from progressive Democrats to embrace a more populist agenda. Antagonism towards Wall Street is a central message of Clinton's rivals like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley."

10,"In 2011, a group of Iowans attempted to draft New Jersey Governor Chris Christie into the presidential race. Although he ultimately decided against running in 2012, that effort has not gone unnoticed by the governor. As Christie prepares for his own 2016 campaign, those same Iowans are now offering him their support. The group, known as Iowans for Christie, was formed in 2011 by a group of Republican activists who believed that Christie would make a strong presidential candidate. The effort gained momentum quickly, with over 4,000 Facebook followers and fundraising efforts that raised several thousand dollars. Despite the support from Iowans and others, Christie ultimately announced that he would not be running in the 2012 campaign. He cited his commitment to his job in New Jersey as the main reason for his decision. But the support of Iowans for Christie did not fade away. In fact, many of the same activists who were involved in the 2011 effort are now offering their support for Christie's 2016 campaign. One of those activists is Tamara Scott, a member of the Republican National Committee from Iowa. She was a driving force behind the 2011 draft effort and is now serving as chair of Iowans for Christie. ""Governor Christie has been a great friend to Iowa over the years, and we think he would make an excellent president,"" Scott said in a recent interview. ""We're excited to support him and help him win the nomination."" Another member of the group, Jeff Jorgensen, said that Christie's leadership was what initially drew him to the governor. Jorgensen is now serving as a co-chair of Iowans for Christie. ""Governor Christie is someone who knows how to get things done, and that's what we need in a president,"" Jorgensen said. ""He's been a leader on issues like education reform and fiscal responsibility, and we think he would be a great president."" Christie has already made several trips to Iowa in recent months, including a speech at the Iowa Freedom Summit in January. Although he has not officially announced his candidacy for president, many believe that he is laying the groundwork for a campaign. Christie's popularity in Iowa could be key to his success in the 2016 campaign. The state is considered a crucial early contest in the presidential race, and winning its caucuses can provide a boost to a candidate's momentum. For Iowans for Christie, supporting the governor's campaign is a way to continue the work they started in 2011. ""We believe in Chris Christie and his vision for America,"" said Scott. ""We're going to work hard to make sure he's the next president of the United States.""","DES MOINES, Iowa — He's behind in the polls and has spent little time in Iowa of late, but Chris Christie is set to get a major bump in the leadoff caucus state with endorsements from nearly all of the local Republican heavyweights who tried to recruit him to run four years ago. Six of the seven big-money donors and activists who flew to New Jersey to urge the Republican governor to run in the 2012 race plan to formally endorse Christie in Des Moines Tuesday. The news was first reported by The Des Moines Register. ""What we've looked at and come around to is similar thoughts as in 2011,"" said Bruce Rastetter, a major GOP donor who made his fortune in the pork and ethanol industries. ""We need blunt, bold leadership. We need somebody that can actually govern."" Of the seven who hopped aboard the private plane to the East coast in 2011, two have long been vocal supporters and one has said he would not endorse because he works for an elected official. Getting the majority to publicly endorse Christie is a boon for his campaign. He has struggled to compete in a crowded field that includes attention-grabbing front-runner Donald Trump. ""Whatever he needs, we're going to be behind him,"" said real estate developer Gary Kirke, who said the group wanted to stick together. His backers think his chances are improving after strong debate performances and with two governors — Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry —now out of the race. Now Rastetter said he hopes the endorsements will send a message to Iowa Republicans, that they should ""give him another look."" Christie held a town hall meeting with Rastetter Monday night, telling the crowd gathered in a cavernous barn that ""you'll always know how hard I'm willing to fight for you."" He declined to talk about the endorsements in advance of the Tuesday press conference. The trip this week marks his ninth to the leadoff caucus state this year. Christie, who has focused more heavily on New Hampshire, has spent less time here than many other contenders, though he put in a marathon day at the Iowa State Fair in August and has a well-regarded team, with respected operatives Phil Valenziano and Jeffrey Boeyink. Campaign aides said Christie will be ramping up his visits to the state in the fall. Mikel Derby, who works for the state's transportation department and who was part of the Christie recruitment effort in 2011, said there is still time for Christie to do well. ""History is littered with the Bachmanns and Walkers who are superstars real early. There's no purpose in peaking in August and September,"" said Derby, who has been with Christie all along. Still, while these endorsements matter, most agree Christie will still have to invest more time in Iowa. Republican State Rep. Chip Baltimore, who has not endorsed a candidate, said there was no substitute for retail politicking. ""If he is not here, he will not do well,"" Baltimore said. ""Gov. Christie, when he talks to people and meets people, is very persuasive. People walk away from that generally feeling positive toward him."""

13,"The Volkswagen scandal, which saw the German car manufacturer using illegal software to cheat in emissions tests sparking the biggest crisis in its 78-year history, will have personnel consequences, according to the German State Economy Minister, Martin Dulig. ""The company culture has to change, and for that you need people who embody and lead that culture,"" Dulig told the German newspaper, Handelsblatt. ""I expect personnel consequences."" As previously reported, Volkswagen has created a new unit, headed by Audi's head of development, Stefan Knirsch, aimed at coordinating work on engine development across the group's twelve automotive brands. The move is part of Volkswagen's effort to overcome the scandal. However, it remains to be seen whether the creation of this new unit will be enough to satisfy the authorities, given mounting reports that the emissions scandal was more widespread than initially thought.","FRANKFURT: Heads are certain to roll at Volkswagen once it becomes clear who at the German carmaker was responsible for the falsification of emissions tests of diesel-powered vehicles in the United States, a German politician and VW supervisory board member said on Tuesday. ""I am sure that there will be personnel consequences in the end, there is no question about it,"" the German state of Lower Saxony's Economy Minister Olaf Lies told German radio station Deutschlandfunk in an interview. But he said a thorough investigation would first have to identify the person or people who were involved in the issue. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said on Friday that Volkswagen used software that deceived regulators measuring toxic emissions and could face penalties of up to $18 billion. The news had sent the company's stock down by nearly 20 percent on Monday."
14,"St. Petersburg, Russia - The second annual ACEX Conference saw logistics companies from around the globe converge in historic St. Petersburg, known locally as the ""Venice of the North."" The event spanned two days and drew in executives from over 30 countries to exchange industry knowledge, establish connections, and map out business strategies.

15,"As the world becomes more conscious of the impact that our daily activities have on the environment, energy regulations continue to evolve. The latest wave of new rules has left many residents wondering how they will be impacted by them. While some are applauding these measures, others are concerned that they will leave people in the dark - both literally and metaphorically. In a recent meeting of local officials, differing opinions were expressed about how to move forward with these new regulations. Some proposed more stringent revisions, while others proposed softer guidelines. As the discussion continued, it became clear that the debate requires a balanced approach that considers the needs of both the environment and the people who rely on energy for their daily needs. A key issue that came up repeatedly in the meeting was the potential impact on residents. Many feel that they are already struggling to make ends meet, and that additional costs associated with new energy regulations will make it difficult for them to afford basic necessities like food and housing. The proposed regulations include a variety of measures aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions, which many see as a necessity in the face of climate change. These include reducing the use of fossil fuels, promoting renewable energy sources like wind and solar, and improving energy efficiency in buildings. While these measures are undoubtedly positive steps towards a sustainable future, some residents are worried about the potential impact on their wallets. Many feel that they simply cannot afford to switch to renewable energy sources or invest in energy-efficient appliances and home improvements. Another concern expressed by some residents is the potential for disruptions to energy supply. While the new regulations may ultimately lead to a more stable and reliable energy grid, the transition period could be rocky - and many worry about being left without power in the interim. Of course, there are also those who are fully supportive of the new regulations. They see them as necessary steps towards a cleaner and more sustainable future, and are willing to make the necessary investments to help bring this about. One proposal put forward at the meeting was a system of incentives to encourage residents to switch to more energy-efficient practices. This could include tax breaks for companies that invest in renewable energy, subsidies for homeowners who purchase energy-efficient appliances, and other measures designed to make the transition easier for everyone. While this proposal has some merit, there are concerns that it may not be enough to sway residents who are already struggling from the effects of COVID-19 and the economic downturn it has caused. Many feel that the government should be doing more to support them during this difficult time, rather than imposing additional regulations that could make life even more challenging. Ultimately, the decision on how to move forward with new energy regulations will require a careful balancing of multiple factors. While it is important to continue progressing towards a cleaner, more sustainable future, it is equally important to ensure that residents are not left behind in the process. As the conversation continues, it is crucial that officials and residents work together to find a way forward that takes everyone's needs into account. Only by doing so can we truly create a brighter and more sustainable future for all.","When new federal regulations kick in this year to reduce power plant emissions, a statewide energy crisis could loom.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is calling for a 32 percent reduction by 2030. In order to get there, several coal plants across Michigan will begin to close this year.In all, nine plants are expected to close over the next two years, with nothing currently planned to replace the energy they produce.Two units at the Trenton Channel Power Plant are among those that will close, along with two more south of the Downriver area at the J.R. Whiting plant near Luna Pier.DTE spokeswoman Randi Berris told The News-Herald Newspapers last year that the decision to close the units was a direct result of the new EPA regulations.“The decision was made because of new federal emissions' regulations taking effect in the next few years, and because of DTE’s focus on reducing customers' rates and maintaining competitive electric rates in the future,"" Berris said.The Wyandotte Municipal Power Plant uses a combination of ways to generate power, coal burning among them. The plant wasn’t on a shutdown list provided by the state of Michigan.No one from the plant was available to talk by press time for this report.Seven of the plants are owned by Consumers Energy and generate more than 950 megawatts of electricity. Overall, more than 1.3 daily gigawatts of power will need to be replaced after the plants all close.That amount would be enough to run Detroit, Grand Rapids and Lansing each day.Consumers Energy officials said they're doing their best to stretch resources to provide electricity to the state’s residents. Those efforts include reopening a Dearborn power plant and the $155 million purchase of the Juniper power plant in Jackson.""You can't store electricity, so it's important to try and have a surplus of it,"" John Russell, president and CEO of Jackson-based Consumers Energy, said in a statement. ""When customers hit the switch, they're either going to have it or they're not.""Both political parties in the state have ideas on how to change regulations to help figure out the looming crisis.The GOP plan recently was released by Sen. Mike Nofs (R-Battle Creek), who chairs the state Senate Energy and Technology Committee.“This legislation represents hundreds of hours’ worth of research, discussion and input from numerous individuals, groups and organizations, including the governor, committee members and the 37-member workgroup I appointed last year,” Nofs said. “These bills represent a starting point for a thorough committee process that will ultimately help us craft the best policy to respond to a rapidly changing landscape for energy.”The Democrats' side is spearheaded by state Rep. Bill Lavoy (D-Monroe) and state Sen. Hoon-Young Hopgood (D-Taylor).“Through 2014, renewable energy projects have brought nearly $3 billion in investment to Michigan, and utilities are on track to meet the 10 percent goal required in current law,” LaVoy said. “As long as renewable energy remains economically viable, the percentage of power generation should increase. Additionally, increasing Michigan-based generation keeps jobs and investment in Michigan.”State Sen. David Knezek (D-Dearborn Heights) and state Rep. Julie Plawecki (D-Dearborn Heights) also are working on the Democratic side of the aisle.The two plans are quite different.Nofs' plan calls for revamping the current integrated resource planning process to change the way utility companies are evaluated. The Republican plan hasn’t been well publicized since it officially was unveiled July 1.The Democratic plan has been on display and talked about since early March. It calls for an increase in support for clean energy-type businesses, with more focus on wind and solar energy companies.“We want to encourage companies to spend here in Michigan,” Knezek said. “Right now, there isn’t anything that restricts out- of-state buying of power. We don’t want that to remain unregulated.”Plawecki echoed those thoughts. She said if Michigan encourages companies to produce energy within the state, it will increase jobs and ultimately help the local economy.Since Michigan passed a renewable energy bill in 2008, more than $5 billion a year have been pumped into the state economy. About $3 billion of that has been invested by private-sector firms.Small-business owners claim the GOP plan for energy production moving forward will put a stop to much of that growth.“The Nofs' plan slams the brakes on Michigan’s clean energy sector, which has been a huge success, supporting 20,500 jobs and $5 billion in annual economic activity,” Mark Cryderman, business development/education manager of the Green Panel, said in a statement. “Polling consistently shows overwhelming support for increasing Michigan’s use of clean energy and the Michigan Legislature should be increasing our clean energy standards, not repealing them.”The Green Panel is a Brighton-based solar company that employs 30 people.State Rep. Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Twp.), who co-authored much of the GOP plan, is against the changes at the federal level, but said he believes its plan is the best bet for the state.“The mandate that is being forced upon Michigan and the rest of the states by the federal government is an unprecedented overreach that will hinder job growth and raise energy rates on hardworking taxpayers,"" Nesbitt said in a statement. “We need an energy plan for the future that ensures reliability and efficiency, while being cost-effective for Michigan families.“The energy proposal I unveiled earlier this year is structured to take an ‘all of the above’ approach that considers each of those elements, rather than a narrow, cookie-cutter approach that picks winners and losers.”Hopgood believes the Democrats' plan is the way to go, both for clean energy and economic growth in the state.“This plan is pro-business, pro-consumer and pro-environment,"" he said. ""Michigan has the potential to be a leader in renewable energy and create thousands of jobs for hardworking men and women across the state. That’s why it’s crucial that we act this year. With these energy principles, my Democratic colleagues and I are ready to get to work.”There is overwhelming public support for increasing renewable energy and energy efficiency, according to a poll conducted by the Michigan Conservative Energy Forum in late 2013. Among the findings, the poll showed that more than 75 percent strongly support an increased renewable portfolio standard and 84 percent support more energy efficiency programs. The support extended to self-identified conservative voters.“With such strong public support from both ends of the political spectrum, it’s clear that this plan is the right way forward for Michigan’s energy sector and our economy,” LaVoy said. “I look forward to working with my Republican colleagues to put these guidelines into action and create jobs while saving residents' money.”According to a report from The Hill Group, a renewable portfolio standard increase would generate as much as $6 billion in economic activity and create tens of thousands of jobs. The Michigan Public Service Commission noted that in 2012 every dollar utilities spent on energy efficiency saved consumers an estimated $3.83 in reduced energy costs."
16,"The Department of Transportation (DOT) is set to test an experimental program that would allow trucks to make overnight deliveries in select cities across the country. The goal of the program is to reduce congestion and improve efficiency on our nation's highways. Starting on September 29th, the program will launch in three cities: New York, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. Trucks participating in the program will be allowed to make deliveries between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., a time when traffic is much lighter. The program is known as the Off-Hours Delivery (OHD) program and is being run by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The FHWA hopes the program will reduce delivery times and lower transportation costs for companies that choose to participate. In addition, the program is expected to reduce pollution and improve quality of life for residents in the cities where it is being tested. While overnight deliveries are not a new concept, the OHD program is unique in that it requires companies to work with local officials to develop a plan for delivering goods during off-hours. Companies will need to work with local officials to determine the best times and routes for deliveries, as well as how to minimize disruptions to residents and businesses. “This is a great example of how the public and private sectors can work together to develop innovative solutions that benefit everyone,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. The OHD program is voluntary, but companies that choose to participate will be required to report their results to the FHWA. The agency will then use this information to evaluate the success of the program and determine if it should be expanded to other cities. Trucking companies and industry groups have been pushing for initiatives like the OHD program for some time. They argue that by allowing trucks to make deliveries during off-hours, they can reduce the number of trucks on the road during peak traffic hours, which in turn can reduce congestion and improve the overall safety of our highways. The FHWA hopes that the OHD program will be a success and that it will lay the groundwork for more effective transportation policies in the future.","Here are five things worth knowing today: 1. New York City and Pensacola, FL, will test overnight truck deliveries in a new U.S. Department of Transportation pilot program to help reduce congestion on city streets. DOT believes that lighter commuter traffic and more available parking overnight will make delivery easier for truck drivers. DOT plans to use grants totaling $200,000 to test its theories in the two pilot cities.

19,"Scotland Rugby World Cup preview: Lamont’s desire still burning strong Veteran Scotland winger Sean Lamont has declared his intention to retire after the upcoming Rugby World Cup. But before he hangs up his boots, the 35-year-old has one last burning desire: to make an impact on the biggest stage of them all. Lamont is one of the most experienced players in the Scotland squad, having made his debut way back in 2004. He has played in three World Cups already and is hoping to add to his 107 caps this year in Japan. Speaking to the London Evening Standard, Lamont said: “I’ve always said that I’ll retire on my own terms, and this is right for me. But before that, I want to give it everything I’ve got at the World Cup. “It’s always been a dream of mine to play in a World Cup and I’m lucky enough to be going to my fourth one. I know this is my last shot at it, and that’s why my desire is burning stronger than ever.” Scotland start their World Cup campaign against Ireland on 22 September before facing Samoa, Russia and Japan in their remaining Pool A fixtures. Despite finishing third in last year’s Six Nations, they will have their work cut out to progress to the knockout stages. Lamont, however, is confident that Scotland can make an impact. “We’ve got a good mix of youth and experience in our squad,” he said. “There’s a real sense of excitement and energy, and everyone’s looking forward to getting out there and playing. “We’ve got a tough pool, but we’re not afraid of anyone. We’ve played some of the best teams in the world over the last few years and we’ve shown that we can compete at that level. “There’s no reason why we can’t go out there and really make a statement.” One of the key factors in Scotland’s success will be the form of their captain, Stuart McInally. The hooker has been in fine form for club and country over the past 12 months and will be crucial to Scotland’s set piece and breakdown play. Lamont also singled out the exciting young backline as another reason for optimism. “We’ve got some fantastic talent in our backline,” he said. “Players like Finn Russell, Huw Jones and Stuart Hogg can really light up a game and create something out of nothing. “If we can give those guys a platform to play off, then we could be a real force in this tournament.” As for his own contribution, Lamont is focusing on being a positive influence on the younger members of the squad. “I’ve been in this game a long time and I’ve seen pretty much everything there is to see,” he said. “Hopefully, I can use that experience to help some of the younger guys in the squad. Whether that’s on the field or off it, I want to be a positive influence and help them to perform at their best.” With the World Cup just around the corner, Lamont’s desire to make an impact is clear for all to see. Whether Scotland can progress beyond the pool stages remains to be seen, but with the experienced winger in their ranks, they will be a team no one will want to face.","With almost a century of caps to his name, Sean Lamont is the old dog of Scottish rugby who believes he has learned enough tricks to keep on barking. But the Glasgow Warrior insists he will be worried if he is not chased out of the side by one of the Dark Blues' young pups. The 34-year-old made his 96th appearance for his country in Saturday's Test against Italy, scoring two tries in the 48-7 Murrayfield rout. It was one step closer to that elusive third figure that will make him just the second Scot after Chris Paterson to have collected 100 caps. But while some may view this year's World Cup in England as a perfect opportunity for Lamont to bow out on a high - especially coming just four months after lifting the first major honour of a 15-year professional career with Glasgow's Guinness PRO12 triumph - the Perth-born back insists he is not interested in exit strategies. In fact, he even wryly joked about the prospect of playing on until the next tournament in Japan in four years' time. But that is only if he is not hounded out by the young pretenders. ""I will never retire,"" said Lamont. ""I've got a contract with Glasgow for next year, but I think I'll ask to go again once it ends. ""The desire is still there, the body is holding out and, provided I'm wanted, I will keep going. Five classic Rugby World Cup Matches ""So I have no plans to call it a day after this World Cup. Could I keep going until the next one in 2019? Well if I was still playing by then I'd be worried. ""I'd be asking myself, 'Where the hell are all the young wingers?' ""I'd be over the moon if I was still around this team by 2019, but I hope to God there is someone coming along to take my place. ""We've got the likes of Damien Hoyland, Rory Hughes and Dougie Fife coming through, so there are plenty of boys about. ""But I won't retire. Someone will retire me, but it won't be my decision."" Lamont has been to the last two World Cups but, while the tournament is the pinnacle for many, his memories are only filled with regret. In 2007 the Scots looked set for a semi-final slot until Argentina robbed them of the chance. The Pumas then roared louder again four years later as Andy Robinson's side failed to even make it out of their group. The Scots are now gearing up for crucial clashes with Japan, America, South Africa and Samoa in Pool B, and Lamont wants his team to learn from the mistakes of the past. He said: ""Both my previous World Cup experiences were a bit of a disappointment, if I'm being frankly honest. ""I loved going and it was great to be part of it. But in 2007 we blew the chance to make a semi-final, which would have been incredible. ""We should have beat Argentina in the quarters. We played all the rugby but didn't see out the win. That's why it was such a pain in the bum. ""Then last time around we didn't even make it out the group, which was disgraceful. ""The alarm bells were ringing in the first two games against Romania and Georgia when we struggled against both. We then had the Argentina game all but wrapped up and a 30-second lapse of concentration cost us the game. ""That left us having to beat a tough England side by 14 points, which was a big ask at any time, never mind in a World Cup. ""So I'm acutely aware of the fact that every pool game we play has got to be top notch. ""We can't just focus on South Africa in the third game as the important one. We're not that good. We're good, but just look at the defeat to Tonga in Aberdeen a couple of years ago. That could happen again if we don't go in with the right attitude."""

The exciting winger, who is rated at £25 million, has been on the radar of several top European clubs, but he has now confirmed that Chelsea is his preferred destination. Brandt, who currently plays for Borussia Dortmund in the German Bundesliga, has had a strong season, recording 4 goals and 10 assists in the league.

The German was signed by Mourinho in 2013 from Bayer Leverkusen but he failed to make an impact under the Special one and was ultimately sold. Now he has claimed the Portuguese manager never fully trusted him. “I had a good time at Chelsea and was accepted in the team, so it’s difficult to explain why I left,” he said. “I don’t know why Mourinho didn’t trust me. It all felt a bit weird to me. I started a few games, was on the bench for a few, then started some more. “It was up and down the whole time. I didn’t get any consistency from the manager so found it hard to produce my best.”"
22,"In a concerning turn of events, markets took a sharp downturn today as durable goods orders experienced a significant drop. According to data released by the Commerce Department, orders for durable goods fell by 0.6% in August, far below the expected 1.5% increase. This marks the worst drop in durable goods orders since April of this year. The drop in orders was mainly attributed to a decrease in demand for transportation equipment, including cars and planes. Orders for motor vehicles and parts declined by 4%, while orders for commercial aircraft fell by 17.7%. The decline in demand for transportation equipment caused a ripple effect throughout the economy, leading to a decrease in overall order numbers. This news sent shockwaves through the market, with major indices all experiencing significant losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 350 points, or 1.3%, while the S&P 500 dropped by 1.2%. The Nasdaq Composite also saw a significant decrease, falling by 1.1%. The drop in durable goods orders is a concerning sign for the economy as a whole, as it suggests a potential slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending. Experts will be closely monitoring the situation in the coming weeks to determine the extent of the damage and what actions may be needed to mitigate any further fallout.","Durable goods orders dropped 2% in August sending the markets tumbling to a sharply lower open with the Dow crashing 242 points to 16,037.

24,"Newark's downtown area is set to get a new hotel, as a developer plans to transform a long-vacant office building into a modern and stylish hotel that will cater to the city's growing tourism industry. The developer, known for his successful hotel projects in other major cities, has purchased the building on Broad Street and is now in the process of securing the necessary permits from the city. The yet-to-be-named hotel will feature approximately 150 guest rooms, meeting and conference facilities, a fitness center, a bar and restaurant, and other amenities that are essential for a modern traveler. Mayor Ras Baraka welcomed the news, saying, “This project is a tremendous boost to our efforts to revitalize downtown Newark and add to our range of offerings for visitors and residents alike. We have worked tirelessly to make our city a destination for tourism, and this hotel represents another important step forward in that effort.” The hotel is expected to bring much-needed economic activity to the area, as it will create employment opportunities for hundreds of people and generate significant revenue for local businesses. Moreover, it will contribute to the city's growing reputation as a major cultural and entertainment hub in the region. The project is also seen as a positive development for the broader community, particularly as it will help to bring investment into an area that has been neglected in recent decades. The new hotel is viewed as a catalyst for further development and regeneration in the vicinity, which would benefit residents and businesses alike. Overall, the new hotel project is a welcome addition to the vibrant city of Newark, and is expected to help boost the local economy, create jobs, and promote the city as a major tourist destination in the region. With its wide range of amenities and excellent location, the hotel is poised to become a popular choice for visitors seeking a comfortable and modern stay in the heart of Newark's downtown area.","NEWARK – The city's downtown may soon be home to another new hotel. Hari Newark Urban Renewal LLC has filed plans with the city to convert the former Catholic Charities building at 1136-1166 Raymond Boulevard into a Homewood Suites Hotel by Hilton extended-stay hotel. The Edison-based developer is also seeking a 20-year tax abatement from the city, which the Municipal Council could approve at its regular meeting Wednesday night. The 12-story building across from Military Park is currently vacant. It is bordered by a parking garage to the east, and Commerce Court to the west. PLUS: Newark alters regulations to pave way for potential downtown casino Hilton spokeswoman Tiffany Wilson said she had no information on when the hotel might open or any agreement with Hari Newark Urban Renewal. Public records indicate that the Edison-based development company is owned by Mehendra Patel, who could not be reached for comment. The new hotel would be one of several planned to open around Newark in the coming years, after the city went nearly four decades without a single new one. That streak ended in 2012, when the Courtyard Marriott opened near the Prudential Center arena downtown , and others have followed, including the boutique Hotel Indigo on Broad Street. Last year, officials approved plans for a Carvi Hotel at the intersection of Lafayette and Monroe streets – the first to be built in the city's Ironbound section . Hilton also has plans for a 108-room Home2 Suites hotel on Haynes Avenue in the South Ward, close to the site of a proposed new train station along a new leg of the PATH rail line to Newark Liberty International Airport.

26,"Anheuser-Busch, one of the largest brewing companies in the United States, announced that it will acquire a craft brewer, signaling a shift in the company's strategy. The move comes after Anheuser-Busch experienced several years of declining sales due to a saturation of the beer market. The acquisition will allow Anheuser-Busch to expand its portfolio of products beyond its traditional mass-produced beers. The company hopes to appeal to younger consumers who are looking for more unique and flavorful beer options. According to a statement released by Anheuser-Busch, the acquisition will ""create a unique and valuable combination of brands, while also driving innovation in the craft beer space."" While the specific craft brewer that Anheuser-Busch plans to acquire has not yet been announced, industry insiders speculate that it may be one of the larger independent breweries, such as Dogfish Head or Boston Beer Company. Anheuser-Busch has a history of acquiring craft brewers, having previously bought out craft beer companies including Blue Point, Elysian, and Goose Island. The acquisition has been met with criticism by some in the craft beer community, who argue that Anheuser-Busch's ownership of smaller breweries takes away from the independent and artisanal nature of craft beer. It remains to be seen how the acquisition will affect the reputation of the craft brewer and its relationship with its loyal customers. However, Anheuser-Busch has emphasized its commitment to preserving the individuality and unique character of its acquired craft breweries. In the past, Anheuser-Busch has allowed its acquired breweries to continue operating independently, while also providing support and resources to help them grow their businesses. The acquisition is part of Anheuser-Busch's broader strategy to diversify its product offerings and appeal to a wider range of consumers. In recent years, the company has focused on developing new products, such as spiked seltzers and non-alcoholic beers, in response to changing consumer preferences. Anheuser-Busch's acquisition of a craft brewer highlights the growing popularity of craft beer in the United States, which now accounts for over 25% of all beer sales. The craft beer industry has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven in part by consumers' desire for more diverse and flavorful beer options. Overall, Anheuser-Busch's decision to acquire a craft brewer signals a shift towards a more diverse and innovative product portfolio. While the move has been met with skepticism by some in the craft beer community, it remains to be seen how the acquisition will affect the industry as a whole.","Anheuser-Busch InBev NV said Wednesday that it is buying Los Angeles-based brewery Golden Road Brewing, the beer giant's latest effort to tap into the growing demand for craft beers. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed. AB InBev, the world's largest beer company with brands like Budweiser and Bud Light, has made a concerted push over the last several years to catch up with American consumers, who increasingly are trading mild-flavored lagers like Bud Light for more flavorful India Pale Ales and porters made by craft breweries. Golden Road road is the largest craft brewery in Los Angeles. Its beers include Point the Way IPA, Wolf Among Weeds IPA, Golden Road Hefeweizen and a collection of seasonal brews. The company, which sells both canned and draft beers, expects to sell 45,000 barrels of beer this year. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of the year. The deal is AB InBev's fifth craft-brewery acquisition since 2011. AB InBev bought its first craft brewer in 2011, paying $38.8 million for Chicago-based Goose Island. It has also picked up Patchogue, N.Y.-based Blue Point Brewing Co., Bend, Ore.-based 10 Barrel, and Seattle-based Elysian Brewing Co. The Golden Road acquisition will give AB InBev a foothold in the growing Los Angeles craft beer market. Golden Road sold approximately 45,000 barrels of beer in 2015. Recent brewery acquisitions have priced craft brewers at more than $1,000 a barrel. Craft's share of the U.S. beer market has more than doubled over the past decade to 9%, while share for mainstream beers like Budweiser and Miller Lite have fallen to 77% from 86%, according to industry tracker Beer Marketer's Insights. Imported beer makes up the rest of the market. The Golden Road deal is the third craft deal this month. MillerCoors LLC, a joint venture between SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Co., recently announced a deal for San Diego-based Saint Archer. Dutch Brewer Heineken NV said earlier this month it took a 50% stake in Lagunitas Brewing, the sixth-largest independent brewer in the U.S. The deal comes as AB InBev pursues beverage-maker SABMiller PLC, a bold move that, if successful, would create a brewing giant that would dominate much of the global beer market. A deal would allow the new beer behemoth to take big mainstream brands like Budweiser and Stella Artois, which have been languishing in key markets, into new corners of the globe.

30,"According to a new report, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from landfills in the United States have been significantly underestimated in the past. The findings call into question the accuracy of existing estimates and highlight the need for more accurate measurements and reporting. The report, titled ""Estimating Methane Emissions from Landfills: Peer-Reviewed Analysis,"" was published by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and research firm ICF. It analyzes data from 190 landfills across 40 states and finds that methane emissions were generally much higher than previously thought. Methane, a potent GHG, is generated by the breakdown of organic waste in landfills. It is estimated to be 28 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in terms of its warming potential. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), landfills are responsible for 5% of global methane emissions. However, the new report suggests that the EPA's current estimate of 12% of total US methane emissions from landfills may be too low. The authors estimate that the actual figure could be closer to 20%, indicating a much larger contribution to overall emissions. The report's lead author, Dr. Mark Brownstein of EDF, said in a statement, ""If the methane problem from landfills turns out to be larger than we thought, it would be a blow to overall efforts to curb greenhouse gases."" He added, ""We need to continue to refine our understanding of the methane problem in landfills to make sure that our efforts to reduce emissions are as effective as possible."" The report also highlights the need for more accurate reporting and measurement of methane emissions from landfills. Currently, most landfill operators use a method known as the Landfill Gas Monitoring Protocol (LGMP) to estimate emissions. However, the report finds that this method may not accurately reflect actual emissions and calls for more precise measurement techniques. The authors recommend using the latest technology, such as drone-mounted sensors and remote sensing, to measure emissions more accurately. They also call for better reporting practices, including regular reporting of emissions data and increased transparency around how estimates are calculated. The report comes at a critical time, as the US seeks to reduce its overall GHG emissions and fulfill its commitments under the Paris Agreement. Landfills are just one source of emissions that need to be addressed, but the report suggests that they may be a larger contributor than previously thought. As Dr. Brownstein notes, ""Reducing methane emissions from landfills is not only important for mitigating climate change, but also for improving air quality and protecting public health."" The report's findings should serve as a wake-up call for policymakers and industry leaders to take action to address this significant source of emissions.","Boston News.Net Monday 21st September, 2015 WASHINGTON - Landfill disposal rates in the US at 262 million tonnes a year in 2012 is more than double what has been estimated by the federal Environmental Protection Agency, according to a study by three US environmental scientists. The study report published Monday in Nature Climate Change, states that the volume of waste in landfills, a major source of the potent greenhouse gas methane, was grossly underestimated in the United States in 2012. Landfill disposal of municipal solid waste represents one of the largest anthropogenic global methane emission sources. Recent policy approaches have targeted significant reduction of these emissions to combat climate change in the US. The study found that as against 122 million tons of garbage estimated to have been dumped in 2012 by the EPA, there was around 262 million tons of garbage dumped in landfills that year, the environmental scientists wrote. ""This suggested that methane emissions, from the decomposition of municipal waste at these dumps, was also undercounted,"" the report states. The scientists claimed to have used a different methodology which was the ""most accurate for the US so far"" than the EPA. The efficacy of active gas collection systems in the US was also examined by the scientists by analyzing performance data, including fire occurrence, from more than 850 landfills. The study's primary goal was to learn more about the efficiency of methane capture systems at landfills, which are more effective after a landfill stops accepting new waste, said study co-author Jon T. Powell, a Yale doctoral student. ""When a landfill reaches the end of its life, an engineered cap or barrier system is installed to seal off the waste material from the environment,"" Powell said. ""Open landfills typically have some areas that are 'closed' in this manner, but also have areas that do not have permanent caps, and it is more difficult to extract methane and other gases that are generated in these areas."" The study found that gas collection systems at closed landfills were significantly more efficient and on average 17 percentage points more efficient than those at open landfills, but open landfills were found to represent 91 percent of all landfill methane emissions. ""These results demonstrate the clear need to target open landfills to achieve significant near-term methane emission reductions,"" states the report. Landfills represent the third-largest, man-made source of methane in the United States -- about 18 percent of domestic emissions, according to the report. Methane lives for a shorter time in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), the most abundant greenhouse gas (GHG), but traps far more of the heat radiated from Earth's surface. The scientists calculated that the average rate of landfill waste disposal was increasing at a rate of about 0.3 percent per year. The underestimation of the waste disposal and the emission in the United States has raised the spectre of similar miscalculations in the rest of the world. ""A high reliance on land filling has been observed in the EU (European Union) and in developing nations, similar to the US,"" wrote the researchers. ""Improving the collection of LFG at open landfills, must be a target for policymakers, researchers and practitioners to achieve near-term GHG emission reductions in the waste sector."""
31,"The Department of Human Services (DHS) is facing tough opposition from the Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) ahead of a crucial wage poll. The department has been fighting for the hearts and minds of staff members who are demanding better wages and working conditions. While the department recognizes the staff's demands, they are arguing that the offer on the table is ""better than nothing."" The offer includes a modest wage increase of 1.8% per year, plus additional leave entitlements. The CPSU is not convinced and has launched a counter-campaign to rally support from employees. They argue that DHS staff are overworked and underpaid, with many employees forced to work overtime or take on additional responsibilities without compensation. They are demanding a wage increase of at least 3% per year. The tension between DHS and CPSU has been building in recent months, with several rounds of negotiations failing to result in a satisfactory outcome. Both sides are now gearing up for a decisive vote on the latest proposal. In an effort to sway staff members, DHS has been highlighting the positive aspects of the offer. They point out that the 1.8% wage increase is in line with the current rate of inflation, meaning that staff members' purchasing power will remain stable. They also emphasize that the additional leave entitlements will provide the staff with more time to spend with their families and recharge their batteries. However, the CPSU argues that the offer is not enough to address the root causes of staff dissatisfaction. They argue that the department needs to invest in recruitment and training to alleviate the workload and improve the overall work environment. The vote is expected to be a close call, with staff members torn between accepting a moderate wage increase and rejecting an offer that they feel does not address their concerns. Many employees have voiced their frustration with the current situation, expressing a desire for a resolution that will put an end to the ongoing dispute. In the coming weeks, both DHS and CPSU will be ramping up their campaigns to sway the vote in their favor. The department will be highlighting the benefits of the current proposal, while the union will be advocating for a more substantial wage increase and meaningful changes to working conditions. Regardless of the outcome, one thing is clear – the tension between DHS and CPSU will not be resolved overnight. The ongoing dispute highlights the challenges facing modern workplaces, where employees are demanding fair compensation and better working conditions, while employers are struggling to balance the budget and deliver services.","The APS's largest department is battling to win hearts and minds. With very simple mathematics. More public service newsDHS wage showdown loomsTax Office offers front-loaded pay deal The federal government's largest department, Human Services, is battling to win the hearts and minds of its 34,000 public servants before they begin voting Friday on a new wage offer. Workers at the giant department are being told that 1.5 per cent pay offer is better than a 0.00 per cent pay offer as management hammers its message with a ""get the facts"" poster blitz. Public servants at DHS sites around Australia arrived at work on Thursday to be confronted with ""Vote-Yes"" screensavers on their computers as management pull out all the stops ahead of the poll. Meantime at the Australian Taxation Office, bosses are battling just to get a ballot up and running as unions take their grievances with the process to the industrial umpire. Campaigning at DHS is reaching fever pitch with the department's senior management and their adversaries in the Community and Public Sector Union blitzing Centrelink, Medicare and Child Support Agency workplaces around the nation with their campaign posters. Better than nothing? tell us what you think at ps@canberratimes.com.au Senior management at the department want to see an end to the troubled bargaining process which has been dogging the department since early 2014 but are up against a determined CPSU effort in the most heavily unionised federal department. The boss's message urges public servants to ""get the facts"", arguing their offer of 1.5 per cent over three years is the ""best pay offer around"". ""1.5% is better than 00.0%, that's a fact!"" the poster declares. ""Low pay offer? It's the best pay offer around and that's a fact too!"" In its response, the CPSU is using the image of public service minister Eric Abetz who the union believes is one of its best assets as it works for the large no-vote it needs to maintain the momentum for its campaign against the Abbott government's public sector wage policies. One poster depicts the minister pushing down on rights, conditions, wages and jobs while another highlights the improvements to the offer that have already been made in the face of the wholesale rejection of earlier proposals. Voting begins on Friday and ends on Thursday, September 10. Meantime at the Australian Taxation Office, unions have applied to the Fair Work Commission for ""bargaining orders"" forcing Tax Office bosses to disclose more information before a vote on their wage offer is held. Senior management are keen to hold a ballot of their 18,000 public servants . But the Australian Services Union, backed by the CPSU, says it needs to know more about Commissioner Jordan's plans for productivity improvements and cost savings between this financial year and 2018-2019. But the ATO's human resources boss Geoff Leeper say he wants to go to a ballot as soon as possible. ""We think that is fair and reasonable after more than 12 months of negotiations,"" Mr Leeper told workers on Wednesday. The ATO is seeking a fast-tracked resolution to the dispute from the FWC.
