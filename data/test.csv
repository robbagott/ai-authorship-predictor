Several people were injured and traumatized as a result of the incident. The use of tear gas has been condemned by human rights activists who have called for an immediate investigation into the matter. This event raises serious questions about the treatment of refugees at border checkpoints and the use of excessive force against vulnerable populations.","Hungarian police have fired tear gas after hundreds of refugees broke through a razor wire fence on the border with Serbia. Tensions flared at an official crossing at Horgos after rocks were thrown by some refugees who've been left without food, water and information.

1,"Businesses cash in on huge boom in staycations With Covid-19 continuing to cause disruptions to international travel, UK businesses have been cashing in on the surge in popularity of staycations. Hotels, bed and breakfasts, holiday homes and campsites have all reported a sharp increase in bookings as Brits opt to stay closer to home for their holidays. According to reports, the boom has been particularly beneficial in areas of the country that are known for their scenic beauty and outdoor attractions, such as national parks and seaside resorts. Many businesses have also adapted their offerings to cater to the demand for staycations. Some hotels have introduced new features to their rooms, such as improved Wi-Fi and entertainment facilities, to make up for the lack of overseas travel. Meanwhile, campsites have added more luxury options, including glamping (glamorous camping) tents and yurts, in a bid to appeal to those who want a more comfortable experience. The surge in staycations has also provided a boost for local economies, especially in areas that rely heavily on tourism. It has created new job opportunities and provided a much-needed lifeline for businesses that were struggling due to the pandemic. The trend is not expected to slow down anytime soon, with many holidaymakers opting to stay in the UK for their vacations in the coming years. However, businesses in some areas have raised concerns about the impact of the staycation boom on infrastructure, such as transportation and waste management. They have called on the government to invest in improvements to ensure that they are equipped to handle the increase in visitors. Overall, it appears that the staycation boom has been a welcome development for many UK businesses and has provided a much-needed boost to the tourism industry. As the trend continues, it will be interesting to see how businesses adapt to meet the changing demands of holidaymakers.","Businesses cash in on huge boom in staycations The rising popularity of staycations is spelling good news for small businesses right across the UK, new research has found. According to the latest study carried out by Barclays Business a massive 77 per cent of Brits have either been on a domestic holiday within the past 12 months, or plan on taking one shortly. Such rising demand for so-called staycations allows Brits to save on money and all the stress that comes with jetting off to foreign climes while at the same time giving a much-needed boost to local economies across the country. Indeed, the bank's new research shows that Britons are now spending around £22.5 billion a year while holidaying in their own country, with the average family splashing out around £540 on their week away. Unsurprisingly, the benefits of this are already being felt in tourism destinations across the country. According to the figures, small business in the hospitality sector have enjoyed a seven per cent increase in turnover over the past year alone. Businesses diversifying to meet changing needs of holidaymakers And it's not just hotels who are benefiting from the trend that has seen growing numbers of Brits ditch foreign holidays in favour of breaks closer to home; restaurants, theme parks, cafes and even normal high street shops are also cashing in as people stay at home instead of heading off for some foreign sunshine. Commenting on the trend, Karen Thomas from Barclays explained: ""We have seen a number of businesses adapt and diversify to make the most of seasonal tourism particularly during summer months. ""Great beaches, local landmarks and beautiful scenery are just some of the drivers of regional tourism, while many accommodation businesses are catering for the nation’s appetite for more unusual places to rest their head, such as a yurt or camper van."" The latest research shows that the South West of England remains the number one staycation spot for Brits, with Welsh beaches and shopping destinations in the north of England also big hits. 13 September 2015, 23"

4,"In an effort to promote healthy eating habits and provide fresh fruits and vegetables to the community, the Market at RTA Transit Center in OH will soon be offering a plethora of produce options for commuters and shoppers alike. Starting next week, customers will be able to browse through an array of locally-sourced fruits and vegetables directly at the transit center, making it convenient and easy to pick up healthy and delicious food options. This initiative by Market at RTA Transit Center highlights their commitment to providing high-quality food options while also emphasizing the importance of healthy eating habits. The introduction of locally-sourced produce at the transit center is part of a broader trend towards healthier eating and sustainable living. Consumers are increasingly conscious about their food choices and are looking for healthier options. This new addition to Market at RTA Transit Center not only provides a service to commuters, but also addresses the demand for fresh and organic produce. Moreover, the farmers who supply the produce will not only be able to sell their produce directly to the consumers but will also get a boost to their business in the process. This adds an extra layer of sustainability to the initiative while also supporting small, local businesses. According to Ted Jones, CEO of Market at RTA Transit Center, the initiative is a natural fit for the transit center as it aligns with the company's commitment to providing accessible, healthy, and affordable food options. He added that the company hopes to expand the range of locally-sourced fruits and vegetables as well as provide cooking demonstrations and workshops for customers. ""Food education is an integral part of promoting healthy eating habits, and we hope to create a culture where people are excited about healthy food options,"" Jones said. The initiative has been welcomed with open arms by commuters, who see this as a major convenience. Previously, commuters would have to make a separate trip to the supermarket to buy fresh produce. Now, they can easily pick up their groceries on the go while they are waiting for their train or bus. Local residents have also expressed their support for the initiative, recognizing its benefits to both the community and the environment. By sourcing produce locally, the transit center helps reduce the carbon footprint involved in transporting and packaging produce, while also contributing to the local economy. The Market at RTA Transit Center's new addition is a win-win situation for both the company and customers. Not only does it further their commitment to healthy eating habits, but it also supports local farmers and provides a convenient way for commuters to access fresh produce. As more people prioritize healthy living, initiatives like this provide a step in the right direction towards a healthier, more sustainable future. The Market at RTA Transit Center's efforts to promote healthy eating habits are an inspiration to all and something that other communities can also aspire towards.","Sept. 08--Downtown Dayton's RTA transit center will start offering fruits and vegetables for sale on Thursday to help improve access to healthy food choices. Some parts of Montgomery County, especially neighborhoods in West Dayton, lack grocery stores and markets that sell fresh produce, said Montgomery County Commissioner Judy Dodge. The Market at Wright Stop Plaza will provide a convenient way for bus riders to pick up affordable and nutritious food items before heading home, said Dodge, who is co-chair of the county's Food Policy Coalition. The new farmer's market also will be only the second in the county to accept food stamp benefits, officials said. ""We just think it's a wonderful start to get people to come in and purchase some good, fresh fruits and vegetables,"" Dodge said. Four wooden carts will likely open inside of the Greater Dayton RTA Wright Stop Plaza later this month. The stands will have a variety of seasonal fruits and vegetables for sale that come from local farms. The market at the plaza will be open all-year round from noon to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday. Homefull, a local nonprofit, will be the market manager and will staff the stands. The project is the work of an all-volunteer group. The pilot program, which received $50,000 in start-up funding from MCOFuture, will last a year. However, organizers hope it will become a permanent and self-sustaining operation. ""It's going to be like ice-skating for a while -- we'll be kind of shaky, and then we'll get going and it'll be like Dorothy Hamill,"" Dodge said. Many bus riders lack access to cars and live miles from stores that have healthy food, like leafy vegetables, Dodge said. Dodge pointed to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that shows about 30 percent of the county's population have limited access to grocery stores. The data shows almost 60 percent of these residents are low-income. Many residents have diets that can impact their health and shorten their lives, she said. There ""is a high rate of diabetes and obesity with our children in Montgomery County,"" she said. The transit center has more than 9,000 boardings per weekday, said Frank Ecklar, RTA spokesman. ""This new fruit/vegetable stand will offer healthy alternatives for our customers or anyone else who visits the Wright Stop Plaza,"" he said. Most vendors at the center sell snacks, candy, soda and fast-food products, many of which have little nutritional value. Also, the market soon will feature an area for food-resource educators, who will provide food-nutrition lessons, recipe ideas and maybe even budgeting advice, said Cathy Startzman, Dodge's commission assistant who worked on the market's advisory committee. Startzman envisions educators will have samples of kale salads, kohlrabi, turnips or other healthy goods for visitors to try. ""This is really about providing food access for people who have difficulty,"" she said. The farmers market will accept electronic food stamp benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It will be only the second market in the county to accept SNAP. Shiloh Farmers' Market on Philadelphia Drive also participates in the program. The market also will offer ""Produce Perks,"" which provide food stamp recipients a dollar-for-dollar match for up to $10 spent at the stands, Startzman said. ""They will get $10 for free, so it will double up that purchase,"" she said. The incentive is offered in other communities, including Hamilton and Cuyahoga counties."
5,"The Baltimore Orioles and the Washington Nationals are both coming off losses heading into their upcoming game at Nationals Park. The interleague matchup between two neighboring teams is always special, but the stakes are higher for the two teams this time around. The Orioles and the Nationals are both looking to bounce back from tough losses. The Orioles fell to the New York Yankees after a tough battle, while the Nationals lost to the Philadelphia Phillies in their last outing. The losses left both teams with 6-9 records and a need to prove themselves. The Orioles will send ace John Means to the mound in the hopes of stopping a two-game losing streak. Means has been one of the bright spots for the Orioles this season. In his three starts, the left-hander has 16 strikeouts in 15 innings pitched with an ERA of 1.52. The Nationals will counter with left-hander Patrick Corbin, who has struggled early on this season. Corbin has a 10.47 ERA with nine strikeouts in three starts. However, Corbin has been dominant against the Orioles in his career, with a 5-0 record and a 1.95 ERA in six starts. The Nationals will need a strong offensive showing from their star players Juan Soto and Trea Turner. Soto has been one of the league’s best hitters since his debut in 2018, with a .292 average, 69 homers and 217 RBI in 249 games. Turner, meanwhile, has been a constant spark plug for the Nationals’ offense, with a .295 average, three home runs, and six RBI in 14 games this season. The Orioles’ offense will be led by Trey Mancini, who is having a fantastic comeback season after missing all of 2020 due to colon cancer. Mancini leads the Orioles with three home runs and nine RBI in 15 games. Ryan Mountcastle has also been a key contributor for the Orioles, with a .275 average and two home runs. The Nationals’ bullpen will be led by Brad Hand, who has been a reliable closer for many years in MLB. Hand has five saves in five chances this season, with a 2.25 ERA and 10 strikeouts in eight innings pitched. The rest of the bullpen has been shaky, however, with a collective ERA of 8.31. The Orioles’ bullpen has been a strength so far this season, with a collective ERA of 3.86. Cesar Valdez has been a pleasant surprise for the Orioles, with three saves and a 0.00 ERA in 6 2/3 innings pitched. Tanner Scott has also been effective, with 13 strikeouts in 9 1/3 innings pitched. In terms of team statistics, the Nationals have the edge in both hitting and pitching. The Nationals have a team batting average of .244, compared to the Orioles’ .216. The Nationals also have a team ERA of 4.53, compared to the Orioles’ 4.82. However, as with any interleague game, anything can happen. Both teams will be looking to prove themselves and get back on track with a win. The game promises to be an exciting matchup between two teams that share the same city, but have very different expectations for the season. The game starts at 7:05 pm ET on April 23, 2021, and will be broadcast on MASN for the local audience. Fans can also tune in on MLB.TV for the out-of-market broadcast. With Means on the mound for the Orioles and Corbin looking to bounce back for the Nationals, the game promises to be an exciting matchup.","at 12:47a ET The Baltimore Orioles can sweep the latest Beltway Series partly because they've controlled the opposing heart of the order and the Washington Nationals haven't. Regardless of what their big hitters do, the Orioles and Nationals are unlikely to make the playoffs even though neither is far removed from having a very realistic chance to repeat as East Division champions. Baltimore enters Thursday's season series finale in D.C. officially eliminated from the AL East chase after first-place Toronto won Wednesday. The Orioles (75-76) last led the division July 2 and were within four games of first Aug. 17 but went on to lose 13 of 15. The current 10-4 stretch has them four behind Houston for the second wild-card spot with 11 to play, but Minnesota and the Los Angeles Angels are also ahead of them. Washington (78-73) is all but out of wild-card contention and six back of the New York Mets in the NL East. The Nationals led the division as recently as Aug. 2 but were amid a 4-13 stretch that let the Mets take control, and they wasted a chance to gain ground by losing 4-1 to the Orioles on Tuesday and 4-3 on Wednesday. Prior to those defeats, Bryce Harper and Jayson Werth keyed a 7-1 span with nine home runs and 20 RBIs. Harper has drawn five walks in this series but was retired in his other three plate appearances. Issuing free passes to the MVP candidate has been a good strategy because Werth, batting cleanup behind Harper, is 0 for 8 while leaving 10 men on base. Baltimore has had no such problems despite cleanup man Adam Jones missing both games with back spasms. Steve Pearce stepped in to deliver a two-run homer Wednesday and an RBI double Tuesday while batting behind Chris Davis, who has two doubles and an RBI. It was No. 2 hitter Manny Machado , though, who had the biggest blow with a go-ahead, two-run homer off Max Scherzer in the seventh inning Wednesday. There may be some lingering ill will after Nationals closer Jonathan Papelbon threw high and tight to Machado in the ninth and later plunked him on the upper arm. Machado yelled toward Papelbon, who was ejected, and the benches briefly cleared. ""When you throw at somebody's head on purpose first pitch, straight out the get-go, then you throw a curveball, then you throw again at the head, that's just ... ,"" Machado said using a street term. ""You know it's coward stuff. It's just coward."" Harper is anticipating some retaliation. ""I mean Manny freaking hit a homer,"" Harper said. ""Walked it off and somebody drilled him. I mean, it's pretty tired. It's one of those situations where it happens and, I don't know, I'll probably get drilled tomorrow."" The one to do it could be Tyler Wilson (2-2, 3.72 ERA). The promising rookie is getting a try in Baltimore's rotation after being recalled last week, but he lost at Tampa Bay on Friday by allowing six runs and eight hits in 4 1-3 innings. The right-hander, who turns 26 on Friday, had a 2.19 ERA in six previous appearances for Baltimore, including two spot starts. ""You got to keep in mind these guys have never really pitched in September before,"" manager Buck Showalter told MLB's official website. ""So it's part of the process, and I think he will learn from it. He's a sharp, competitive guy."" Washington goes with Tanner Roark (4-6, 4.73), who has failed to pitch past the fifth inning in three starts since his call-up. His worst performance since returning came last Thursday when he surrendered six runs and eight hits in a 6-4 loss at Miami, though Roark said it was an effort he could ""build off."" He has a 5.66 ERA in nine starts this season."

7,"The Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) has inaugurated a regional water and sanitation forum to promote important discussions and cooperation among experts in the sector. The forum, which marks a significant milestone for CABEI, is expected to play a leading role in addressing some of the most pressing issues facing the Central American region, and ultimately contribute to improving the quality of life of millions of people. The inauguration of the forum was marked by a high-level event held in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, last week. Participants included ministers responsible for water and sanitation, senior officials from CABEI, representatives of international organizations such as the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), as well as key stakeholders from the sector. During the event, participants highlighted the urgent need for greater investment in water and sanitation services, particularly in underserved and marginalized communities. They also emphasized the importance of integrating the principles of sustainability and resilience into all aspects of water and sanitation management, from planning and financing to delivery and monitoring. In his opening remarks, CABEI's Executive President, Dante Mossi, underlined the significance of the forum in advancing the bank's mission of promoting sustainable development and regional integration. ""Access to clean water and adequate sanitation are fundamental human rights, and essential for the economic growth and development of our region,"" he said. Mossi also highlighted some of the key challenges facing the water and sanitation sector in Central America, including recurring droughts, water scarcity, and inadequate infrastructure. He stressed the need for innovative solutions to these challenges and committed CABEI's support to the development of sustainable and cost-effective water and sanitation solutions. The forum is expected to serve as a platform for sharing knowledge, best practices, and experiences among stakeholders in the water and sanitation sector, and for promoting dialogue and collaboration at the regional level. It will also serve as a space for discussing new initiatives and projects, as well as for identifying opportunities for financing and investment. In closing the event, Mossi expressed optimism about the future of the water and sanitation sector in Central America. ""We have the knowledge, the technology, and the resources to address the challenges we face, and to create a better future for our citizens,"" he said. ""Working together, we can build a more resilient, sustainable, and equitable region.""","Renowned journalist Glenda Umaña invited the first panelist, Dr. Luis Romero Quesada, technical coordinator at CONASA and interim assistant coordinator at FOCARDS-APS, to talk about the current status of water and sanitation services in Central America and the Caribbean. Tegucigalpa, September 22, 2015. – Today, in the face of the huge challenges presented by climate change, especially with regard to potable water supply, the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) inaugurated a forum denominated, “The 2nd Regional Public Service Forum: Water for All.” The two-day event was held at the CABEI headquarters with the participation of experts from Central America, Colombia, Mexico and Spain. During the event’s inaugural ceremony, CABEI Executive Vice President Attorney Alejandro Rodríguez Zamora stated that, “The Bank is committed to supporting regional efforts in order to provide a platform for dialogue at the highest level regarding the water and sanitation sector.” He also stated that, “CABEI’s approach to the water and sanitation sector falls in the framework of its focus area of ‘Human Development and Social Infrastructure,’ which supports initiatives to improve human capital development and the quality of life through the provision of basic services and the creation of mechanisms to streamline the labor market."" Attorney Rodríguez noted that in order to establish the water and sanitation sector intervention strategy on a regional level, CABEI has implemented a number of strategic instruments, such as the Regional Water and Sanitation Program (PRAS), which aims to improve the quality of life of 52,186,061 people in Central America and the Dominican Republic by providing access to basic services, including potable water and sanitation services, as well as wastewater treatment. These development interventions are effectively improving the current conditions of the target population. The CABEI Vice President also summarized CABEI’s contribution to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) with regard to water and sanitation, declaring that over 55 years, the Bank has approved US$784 million in the area, 85% of which, amounting to US$667.47 million, has been disbursed over the last ten years. Thus, CABEI has contributed to increasing universal potable water coverage by promoting efficient extraction and distribution methods to avoid losses; improving sanitation mechanisms; treating water to prepare it for human consumption; wastewater treatment; and promoting active social participation to ensure the sustainability of the services. The forum provided a platform for experts to analyze global technological and cooperation issues in order to deal with the problem of water scarcity."
8,"An Austrian recycling plant was severely damaged in a fire that broke out on Tuesday night. The plant, located in the city of Graz, is a key facility for the recycling of plastic waste in the region. The fire broke out in one of the storage areas of the plant and quickly spread to other areas, causing significant damage. Firefighters arrived on the scene promptly and worked throughout the night to contain the blaze, which was finally brought under control early on Wednesday morning. No one was injured in the fire, but the damage to the plant is estimated to be significant. The cause of the fire is not yet known, and an investigation has been launched to determine the cause. The plant is owned and operated by a local recycling company and is a crucial part of the region's waste management infrastructure. It is responsible for the recycling of a significant amount of plastic waste generated in the area each year. The company has released a statement saying that it is working with authorities to investigate the cause of the fire and assess the damage to the plant. It has also assured its customers that it will do everything in its power to minimize the impact of the fire on its operations and maintain its high-quality standards of service. The incident has highlighted the importance of proper waste management and recycling practices, particularly in the context of environmental sustainability. The recycling of plastic waste is a crucial part of efforts to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and contribute to a more circular economy. It is not yet clear how the fire will impact the region's recycling and waste management operations in the short and long term. However, it is clear that efforts must be made to ensure that the plant is repaired and operational as soon as possible. Local authorities have expressed their support for the company and commended the efforts of the firefighters in containing the blaze. The incident is a reminder of the importance of maintaining robust emergency response systems and investing in infrastructure to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.","Updated 9/2/2015 Email Print Richard Higgs PLASTICS NEWS EUROPE Weitendorf Volunteer Fire Department More than 500 firefighters from the region around Wilden, Austria, were called to help fire a blaze at recycler Ecoplast Kunstoff-Recycling GmbH Nine fire fighters were injured tackling a serious blaze that broke out Aug. 29 at a plant operated by Austrian plastics recycler Ecoplast Kunstoff-Recycling GmbH, south of the city of Graz, Austria. Eight of the injured collapsed from extreme heat generated by the fire, which started among stored bales of plastic waste, Another fireman, suffering from suspected carbon monoxide poisoning was airlifted to hospital in Graz, reported local media. A team of four doctors and 35 paramedics are reported to have attended the site during the incident. More than 500 firefighters from 40 regional units were deployed to deal with the blaze which erupted at the Ecoplast plant near Wildon in soaring late summer temperatures. A 100 meter plume of black smoke, 40 meters across, hanging over the recycling plant was reportedly visible 20 kilometers away in Graz. It took the fire brigade, which drew water from the nearby River Mur, around 24 hours to extinguish the flames and dampen down the fire. Footage posted on YouTube by volunteer firefighters from the nearby city of Weitendorf showed the extent of the fire and the size of the smoke plume. The big blaze which broke out in stacked bales stored outside, and partially damaged a storage building. Flames spread to trees surrounding the rural site and to undergrowth on the banks of the nearby River Mur. “Extreme heat” threatened to burst a biogas tank, but a concerted effort by firefighters to cool the tank averted a serious explosion. At one point, officials requested the attendance of a large fire truck from an airport fire brigade. An additional 5,000 liters of fire extinguishing foam had to be brought to the site to boost an initial 1,800 liter supply, according to media reports. Police are investigating the fire’s cause. Ecoplast, which operates just the Wildon recycling site, processes 28,000 metric tons of post consumer plastics waste each year, producing high density and low density polyethylene recyclate there.

A federal judge ruled that Curtis, who is representing himself in the case, cannot personally interview the women, who are suing him for harassment, discrimination, and retaliation. The judge cited the potential for further harm and intimidation to the alleged victims as reasons for the restriction. Curtis, who is currently serving a seven- to 15-year prison sentence for the 2013 conviction, denies the sexual misconduct allegations and has argued that he should be able to question the women himself. The case is scheduled to go to trial in September.","Former MLB player Chad Curtis says the young women who accuse him of sexual misconduct at a Michigan high school are looking for a payday.

10,"Arsenal striker, Theo Walcott, has revealed that Arsene Wenger has placed his confidence in him to lead the club's attack. Walcott is set for a major role this season as he looks to prove himself as a reliable goal scorer for the Gunners. Wenger has backed the England international to play a major part in Arsenal's campaign despite the presence of other star strikers in the team. ""I've had a chat with the manager and he's told me he believes in me,"" said Walcott, according to The Mirror. The 27-year-old has been at Arsenal since 2006, but has often found himself behind other players in the pecking order, particularly in recent years. However, the departure of veteran striker, Olivier Giroud, to Chelsea, has left a void that Walcott is hoping to fill. ""I'm looking forward to the season and I'm really excited to show the manager what I can do,"" Walcott added.","Arsene Wenger has great belief in Theo Walcott as a striker, according to the attacker himself. The Arsenal boss has favoured the England international ahead of the Frenchman in recent weeks. And Walcott is ready to repay his faith with plenty of goals. ‘I have always said to the manager that I can always play in a three-man forward line so it is a good option for him,’ he said. ‘At the moment he believes I can do it up front and the more I play up front, the more the players will see the runs I make and what I do on the pitch as well. ‘I will be judged on the goals I score. You can play the best game in the world but if you don’t score it doesn’t mean anything. ‘But I’m very confident I can do a job up front.’"
11,"Dr. Eva Carneiro, the well-known former Chelsea team doctor, is set to leave the club after six years of service. The news has come as a shock to many Chelsea fans who hold her in high regard for her contributions to the club. Carneiro gained media attention in 2015 for her altercation with then-manager Jose Mourinho, which ultimately led to her departure from her role on the first team. Following her departure, Carneiro worked with FIFA as a medical expert, but now it seems she is ready to move on from that too. The reasons for her departure from Chelsea are still unclear, but it is expected that the club will be issuing a statement soon.","Share Tweet The manner in which our season has started is worrying. As well as our poor form on the pitch we`ve once again become embroiled in a situation whereby the goings-on at Stamford Bridge have seen the club on the back pages of the media for all the wrong reasons.

Our good friends at the Telegraph are, this morning, running with the inference that the lovely Portuguese lady has yet to resume her medical duties since the incident with Jose Mourinho."

15,"Mumbai, Aug 31 (Reuters) - India’s economic growth slowed more than expected in the three months to June, putting pressure on the central bank to cut interest rates again in the hope of boosting activity ahead of elections due early next year. A Reuters poll of economists had predicted GDP growth of 6.7 percent for the April-June quarter, compared with 7.7 percent in the corresponding period last year. However, the latest data showed that growth had actually slipped to 6.5 percent, marking the slowest quarterly expansion in three years and significantly below the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) target of 7.4 percent. The release of the data coincided with the central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, at which it opted to leave interest rates unchanged at 6.5 percent. However, the weaker-than-expected growth figures are likely to increase pressure on the RBI to cut rates further in the coming months, especially given concerns over rising inflation and the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China. “The fact that growth has slowed means that the RBI may have to rethink its growth projections for the year, especially given the headwinds from global factors,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings. “It’s possible that the central bank might cut rates by another 25 basis points before the end of the year, depending on how the data and other factors pan out.” India’s economy has been beset by a range of challenges in recent months, including rising fuel prices, a liquidity crunch in the banking sector and a weaker rupee. In addition, the country’s trade deficit widened to a five-year high in July, adding to concerns around the impact of global trade tensions. Despite these headwinds, the government has said it is confident of achieving its target of 7.5 percent GDP growth for the financial year ending March 2019, buoyed by strong consumer spending and investment in infrastructure projects. However, analysts warn that achieving this target could be difficult without further policy support. “The numbers suggest that India’s economy is struggling to regain momentum, and that a further easing of monetary policy may be needed to give it a boost,” said Sanjay Mathur, chief economist for Southeast Asia and India at ANZ Bank. “Given the challenges facing the economy, the government may need to consider additional measures to offset the impact of rising oil prices and trade tensions, as well as provide more stimulus to support growth in key sectors such as manufacturing and agriculture.” The next MPC meeting is scheduled for October 3-5, when the bank is widely expected to announce a further cut to interest rates.","NEW DELHI, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Indian growth slowed by more than expected in the quarter to June, a setback for Prime Minister Narendra Modi that will prompt more urgent calls from his aides for... … (Repeats story from late on Monday) * June qtr growth 7 pct vs 7.5 pct in March qtr * Matches China's growth in the same quarter * Weakness in India's services sector drags growth * Analysts expect central bank to cut interest rates By Rajesh Kumar Singh NEW DELHI, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Indian growth slowed by more than expected in the quarter to June, a setback for Prime Minister Narendra Modi that will prompt more urgent calls from his aides for interest rate cuts. Many government officials in New Delhi had been talking of taking the baton of global growth in the wake of a deepening economic crisis in China. However, Monday's government data showed gross domestic product expanded at an annual 7 percent rate in the April-June quarter, matching China, but slower than provisional growth of 7.5 percent in the previous quarter. While doubts still persist over India's new way of calculating GDP, even though the method gained an endorsement from the World Bank's chief economist, there is no denying the fact that the economy is still struggling to gather steam. ""There's a lot of emphasis that's being put on the opportunities that lie ahead for India and not too much attention is being paid to the challenges that remain today,"" Jyotinder Kaur, principal economist at HDFC Bank. It is also a blow for Modi whose image as the country's economic saviour has taken a beating after his struggle to pass his legislative agenda. Modi swept to power last year on a promise of speedier growth creating millions of manufacturing jobs. But just 15 months after that electoral triumph, disenchantment has set in. Businesses as well as young Indians are getting restless with slow progress on the ground. ""We need to move this (GDP) figure up given the imperative of employment generation,"" said Jyotsna Suri, head of a local industry chamber, FICCI. A 22-year-old activist has stirred upheaval in Modi's home state Gujarat, accusing the Indian leader of breaking the promise to provide jobs. RATE CUT? The latest data will also strengthen the calls from Modi's administration for a rate cut. Some bureaucrats are already arguing for an immediate cut of as much as 50 basis points in the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) main 7.25 percent policy rate. The RBI has cut the policy repo rate 75 basis points since January. But it left the rate on hold at its last policy review early this month. ""In our view, (it) clearly paves the way for two more repo rate cuts before the close of the financial…"

18,"As our society continues to face complex and pressing challenges, it can be easy to get lost in debates about solutions and strategies. However, in the midst of these discussions, it is crucial that we don't forget the voices that are often the most innovative, thoughtful, and visionary ones: those of our youth. At a time when young people face unprecedented challenges, such as climate change, rising inequality, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever that we listen to their answers, their solutions to these issues. In this guest view, we explore the urgency of hearing from our youth, and why doing so can pave the way for more inclusive and effective solutions. Firstly, young people have a unique perspective on today's issues. With their fresh eyes and open minds, they can offer new angles on problems that may be entrenched in outdated ways of thinking. These perspectives can often help us break out of our comfort zones and see issues in a new light. Take climate change, for example. The younger generations around the world have grown up in a context of data and science that shows an urgent need to act on mitigating climate change. They know the facts, and they are bold and uncompromising in their demands for change. They can see that our planet must be preserved for future generations and that the time for action is now. Secondly, young people have a vital role to play as agents of change. They are often at the forefront of movements for social and political change, and their energy can be a powerful catalyst for broader social action. We have seen this time and time again throughout history, from the civil rights movement in the 1960s to the Black Lives Matter movement today. It is crucial that we recognize and harness this potential, by supporting and empowering young people to play active roles in shaping their own futures. Whether through youth-led movements, community engagement, or political participation, young people can be powerful change-makers who can drive real progress on the issues that matter most. Finally, young people are the ones who will inherit the world that we leave behind. They are the ones who will have to live with the consequences of the decisions we make today. That is why it is so important that we listen to their voices, their concerns, and their ideas. It is only by doing so that we can ensure that our actions today don't come at their expense. But listening to young people is not enough. We also need to act on what they say. We need to take their input seriously and work to create concrete policies and initiatives that reflect their vision for the future. This requires a real commitment to youth participation, investment, and empowerment. In conclusion, our youth are the future of our society. By listening to their answers to today's most pressing issues, we can break out of stagnant thinking and tap into new solutions and approaches. By empowering them to act as change-makers, we can harness their energy and creativity to drive real progress on the issues that matter most. By working together, we can create a more just and sustainable future for all.","We all have a story. If someone asks how you are doing, do you always say with a smile, “I’m fine. How are you?” Or do you tell them how you really are doing? If we always say we’re fine, we are likely not sharing the ups and downs of life. The “I’m fine” response could be fine if you are coping well, but what happens when the challenges of life are overwhelming but kept bottled up? A particularly challenging time in life is adolescence, when teens and pre-teens experience rapid physical, mental and emotional change. How we tell our story or whether we tell it at all can depend on who is listening. Who is listening to the adolescents and young adults in our community? Teens may be hesitant to share their stories because they don’t think anyone will listen or take them seriously, or they feel misunderstood. They need a place to share their ideas and form a sense of belonging. Teens with mental health concerns can do both at the San Benito County Behavioral Health Esperanza Center in downtown Hollister (544 San Benito St., Suite 102). The Esperanza Center is a place for 16- to 25-year-olds to engage with others in similar situations. It fosters a community of non-judgment and acceptance, and also encourages healthy eating through weekly group meetings. Teens can also build critical relationships with peers and adults through school and community activities. They can benefit from expressing themselves through art, music, dancing, cooking, writing or other creative endeavors. They can engage in physical activity through organized sports and pick-up games, or through hiking the Pinnacles and biking through the countryside. They can volunteer to feed the hungry or house the homeless, simultaneously helping their community and recognizing their positive impact on others. They can join clubs or teams at school, and join youth religious groups. We encourage adolescents and their friends and family to participate in activities like the local Red Ribbon Run, an annual event that shows our commitment to a drug-free community. This year’s 26th Annual Red Ribbon Run is Oct. 10 and you can Like the Hollister Red Ribbon Run Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HollisterRR5K. Part of the reason our teens and others are reluctant to engage in conversation about mental health concerns is that they continue to carry a degree of stigma that other health problems do not. This can lead youth to feel ashamed of their problems. Programs such as the Each Mind Matters campaign and the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) Prop 63 are addressing this stigma. One such effort, Walk In Our Shoes, http://www.walkinourshoes.org/, provides real stories of struggling youth, myths and facts about mental health, and resources for parents and teachers. Each Mind Matters also published a resource for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and/or questioning (LGBTQ) teens called “Be True and Be You: A Basis Mental Health Guide for LGBTQ Teens.” They refer LGBTQ youth, who have a higher rate of depression and suicide attempts, to call The Trevor Project at 1-866-488-7386 in a mental health crisis. Another project is the Directing Change Student Film Contest where high school students can create 60-second films about suicide prevention or ending the silence about mental illness. To view the videos visit http://www.directingchange.org/. Adolescents may benefit from seeking mental health services when they are experiencing overwhelming difficulties in school, relationships or in daily life in general. The Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) services can assist youth before symptoms get severe. The Youth Alliance is contracted with San Benito County Behavioral Health to provide PEI services in local schools, and adolescents can be referred for mental health services. When youth, parents and caregivers, or professionals have serious concerns, a good resource is http://www.samhsa.gov/suicide-prevention from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA). These additional resources are also available: Suicide Prevention of the Central Coast at 1-877-ONE-LIFE (1-877-663-5433) The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). San Benito County Behavioral Health 24/7 mental health crisis services at 1-888-636-4020 or (831) 636-4020. I encourage you to take a few moments today and every day to ask the youth in your life how they are doing. And really listen to the answer. Your interest may make a difference for that person’s day, week or even life."
19,"In an unprecedented move, Russia has launched its first airstrike in Syria, according to reports from the region. The strike reportedly targeted ISIS positions in the Homs region of Syria and is said to have been carried out with the use of precision-guided munitions. Details surrounding the airstrike are still emerging, but reports indicate that the mission was carried out with the full approval of the Syrian government. The move comes just days after Russian forces began deploying to the country, sparking concerns among Western powers about Moscow's intentions in the region. The Russian Defense Ministry released a statement confirming the airstrike, saying that it was ""aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the fight against ISIS."" ""The Russian Air Force in Syria conducted its first airstrikes on terrorist targets in Homs province today,"" the statement read. ""The strikes were carried out by Su-34 and Su-24M fighter-bombers, and targeted ammunition and fuel depots, as well as military equipment and vehicles belonging to the terrorists."" The statement went on to emphasize that Russian military officials had ""established direct contact with the Syrian army,"" and that the two forces were ""fully coordinating their actions"" in the fight against ISIS. The move is sure to further fuel tensions between Russia and Western powers, especially in light of recent criticisms of Moscow's military involvement in Ukraine. The US has expressed concern over the extent of Russia's deployment, with President Obama stating that Russia is ""in Syria in part because they believe [President Bashar al-Assad] is threatened and that they need to shore him up."" Washington has warned Russia to ""rule out any military support to the Assad regime"" and to focus on combating ISIS. Meanwhile, the UK has also expressed doubts over Russia's intentions, with Prime Minister David Cameron saying that ""we have to be careful that this isn't another move towards propping up Assad rather than actually fighting ISIS."" Despite such concerns, Russia appears to be committed to its campaign against ISIS in Syria. In an interview with Russian media last week, President Vladimir Putin said that the campaign was justified by the fact that ""thousands of people from Russia and other post-Soviet republics are fighting on the side of ISIS."" ""The only real way to deal with this threat is to hit it hard,"" Putin said. The situation in Syria is complex and constantly evolving, and it remains to be seen how Russia's airstrike will impact the ongoing conflict. However, one thing is clear: with its first official airstrike in Syria, Russia has signaled its determination to play a major role in the region's future.","(CNN) - [Breaking news update, 7:53 a.m.] Russia has conducted its first airstrike in Syria, near the city of Homs, a senior U.S. official told CNN Wednesday . The Russians told the United States that they should not fly U.S. warplanes in Syria, but gave no geographical information about where they planned to strike. The senior official said U.S. missions are continuing as normal. [Previous story, 6:32 a.m. ET] The upper house of the Russian parliament has given President Vladimir Putin approval to use the Russian air force in Syria, according to state media. ""The Federation Council unanimously supported the President's request -- 162 votes in favor of granting permission,"" Kremlin Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov said, according to ITAR-Tass. The vote came after a request by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for military assistance in fighting ISIS, Ivanov said. 'They are ready' Russian airstrikes in Syria could happen at any time, a U.S. official with knowledge of the latest intelligence told CNN this week. ""They could start at any moment,"" the official said. ""They are ready."" After several days of Russian familiarization flights, there is no reason they could not begin, the official added. And Russian drones have been collecting potential targeting information in their flights. But the U.S. doesn't know what the Russians have in mind and when they will make a decision on airstrikes. Four Russian Su-34 Fullback fighter jets are now at the Latakia air base in Syria, and more than 600 Russian troops are in place. Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook told reporters Tuesday that Secretary of Defense Ash Carter directed his staff to ""open lines of communication with Russia on de-confliction."" The timing of these discussions is to be worked out in the coming days. The purpose of the discussions is ""to ensure the safety of coalition air crews,"" he said. Cook added that the two nations have common ground when it comes to fighting ISIS, also known as ISIL, with Carter making clear that ""the goal should be to take the fight to ISIL and not to defend the Assad regime."" Just ISIS or something more? Russia continues to position itself to potentially launch airstrikes in Syria, but its movements suggest that its targets are something other than ISIS, according to U.S. officials. ""We see some very sophisticated air defenses going into those airfields. We see some very sophisticated air-to-air aircraft going into these airfields. I have not seen ISIL flying any airplanes that require SA-15s or SA-22s (Russian missiles). I have not seen ISIL flying any airplanes that require sophisticated air-to-air capabilities,"" Gen. Phillip Breedlove, NATO's supreme allied commander, said on Monday. ""I'm looking at the capabilities and the capacities that are being created and I determine from that what might be their intent. These very sophisticated air defense capabilities are not about ISIL. They're about something else,"" he concluded. Separately, Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work confirmed to the Senate on Tuesday that Russia has violated a missile treaty with the United States but indicated that the administration didn't plan to take any action at present. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, asked Work at a hearing whether he thought the Russians had breached the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty governing the elimination of medium-range missiles. ""We believe very strongly that they did,"" he responded. But he also said, ""This is still in discussions and we have not decided on any particular action at this point,"" noting that the United States has been in contact with the Russians over the issue. U.S. efforts stuck in neutral Meanwhile, America's own efforts to turn the tide in Syria have faltered once again. The Pentagon has stopped moving new recruits from Syria to its training centers in Jordan and Turkey to train and equip moderate rebels to fight ISIS, a U.S. defense official told CNN on Tuesday. The deeply troubled program has several dozen fighters in training right now, but new fighters will not be brought in until the White House makes a decision on how it wants to change the effort. Several options are being considered, including having the rebels train to provide assistance in calling in airstrikes and conducting communications."

22,"Rapper Rick Ross has found himself in hot water after his ex-partner, Tia Kemp, publicly accused him of taking their son's car without permission. According to Kemp, her 16-year-old son was gifted a BMW by Ross for his birthday. However, she claims that the rapper took the car back without her or her son's knowledge or consent. Kemp took to social media to air her grievances, posting a screenshot of a text message exchange with someone who appears to be Ross, in which he refuses to return the car. She also shared a video of her son expressing his disappointment over the situation. In response to the accusations, Ross has remained tight-lipped. However, this isn't the first time the former couple has publicly feuded. Kemp has been vocal about her dissatisfaction with Ross' parenting in the past, claiming that he has not been involved enough in their son's life. Ross has yet to publicly comment on the situation, and it remains to be seen how this will develop. For now, fans are left wondering whether the rapper will make amends with his ex and their son.","Picture: Tia Kemp lashed out at the hip-hop star on social media on Thursday (10Sep15), when she shared a photo of their nine-year-old boy William standing next to the BMW B7, which she alleges was a gift from father to son. She captioned the snap, ""Rick Ross takes the car from his Son Again!!"". Kemp then uploaded a series of pictures of the Hustlin' hitmaker with famous friends like Sean 'Diddy' Combs and T.I. and issued desperate pleas to each of the stars, begging them to convince Ross to hand back the keys to the vehicle. However, according to TMZ.com, the rapper did nothing wrong legally as he paid for the car and still has it in his name. Reports suggest Ross may have taken back the car as punishment for Kemp after she repeatedly slammed his new girlfriend, Lira Mercer, online. It's the latest fall out between Ross and Kemp after she filed legal papers in July (15) seeking an increase in child support, insisting the 39 year old can afford to pay her much more than the $1,951 (£1,300)-per-month she currently receives."

24,"Arteries Closed, City ‘Immersed’ in Traffic Chaos The city of Mumbai came to a standstill yesterday as several major arterial roads were shut due to a political rally. The closure of these roads caused complete traffic chaos, leaving people stranded for hours. The rally was organised by a local political party and was attended by a large number of supporters. While the rally may have been a success for the organisers, it left the commuting public in a state of despair. The roads that were closed included the Western Express Highway, the Eastern Express Highway, the Sion-Panvel Expressway and several key arterial roads in the city that lead to important junctions. The closures resulted in a cascading effect on the traffic flow in the city, causing gridlocks and traffic snarls across the city. The situation was made worse by the rains, which made the roads slippery and resulted in slower movement of vehicles. Commuters who were on their way to work were the worst affected, with many giving up on reaching their destinations and returning home. The city’s lifeline, the local trains, were also heavily overcrowded, adding to the chaos. A resident of Dadar, who works in Andheri, said, “I left my house at 7 am and it’s already 11 am, but I’ve only managed to reach Dadar station. There is no way I can make it to work today.” Others were more critical of the situation, with many taking to social media to vent their frustration. Some even called for stricter regulations on political rallies to prevent traffic disruptions. The situation gradually started improving by late afternoon, as the roads were reopened and traffic began to flow again. However, the damage had already been done, with thousands of people losing hours of their precious time. It seems that political rallies will continue to cause traffic disruptions in the city, leaving commuters hoping for better planning and management of such events in the future.","HYDERABAD: With the Ganesh 'nimajjan' spilling over to the second day, the city roads turned chaotic on Monday. Massive traffic snarls in areas around Hussainsagar had a cascading effect and soon large parts of the city were thrown out of gear. As arterial roads around Hussainsagar, including the Khairatabad flyover, were closed for normal traffic throughout the day, bottlenecks on roads in Secunderabad, Lakdikapul and Himayatnagar became inevitable. Lakhs of motorists had to experiment with detours to reach their workplaces and back home, covering short distances in long hours. To make up for the inordinate delay in start of the main procession from the Old City (South Zone), police gave idols moving from Charminar priority for immersion at Hussainsagar. As a result, the idols from South and West Zone could reach Tank Bund and NTR Marg only by Monday morning. Also, over 1,000 idols -- mainly from West Zone --which were scheduled to be immersed on Friday, started arriving for immersion on Monday as the organisers deferred their plans for reasons untold. Till 7 am, idols were seen moving towards Hussain Sagar near Lakdikapul, Liberty junction and RTC X roads. The Telugu Talli flyover was shut till 11 am, while Tank Bund, NTR Marg, Necklace Road and Khairatabad flyover remained shut till 6 pm. Due to the traffic restrictions, travelling on the arterial Sardar Patel Road become a nightmare for office-goers till 1 pm. ""To travel an 8-km stretch from my house in Secunderabad to my office at Punjagutta through SP Road, it took me close to one-and-half hours,"" T Sai Chand, an employee of a software firm told TOI. As school managements were not forewarned about the possible traffic restrictions, many parents negotiated the bumper-to-bumper jam and reached educational institutions only to be informed by the management that a holiday was declared as many students failed to turn up due to traffic problems."

26,"NGO to Release Conflict Minerals Filings Report September 22 The Enough Project, a non-governmental organization dedicated to combating genocide and crimes against humanity, will release its annual “Conflict Minerals Filings Report” on September 22. The report analyzes the efforts of publicly traded companies to ensure their products do not contain conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and neighboring countries. The Enough Project’s report assesses companies listed on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that are required to file yearly conflict minerals disclosures. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 requires companies to report whether conflict minerals, including tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold, are used in their products. Conflict minerals are widely used in electronic devices, such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets. According to the United Nations, conflict minerals fuel violence and human rights abuses in the DRC and surrounding areas, as armed groups profit from the sale of these minerals to fund their operations. In its previous reports, the Enough Project has found that many companies are not taking enough action to ensure their supply chains are free of conflict minerals. Some companies have failed to file disclosures, while others have reported that they cannot determine whether their products contain conflict minerals. The report also highlights companies’ efforts to trace and audit their supply chains to prevent the use of conflict minerals. The Enough Project hopes that its annual report will encourage companies to take action to eliminate conflict minerals from their supply chains and help create a more peaceful and stable region in the DRC and surrounding areas. “This report allows consumers and investors to hold companies accountable for their use of conflict minerals,” said Annie Kelly, Campaigns Director at the Enough Project. “We hope that more and more companies will take steps to ensure that their products are not contributing to violence and human rights abuses.” The release of the report comes at a critical time for the DRC, which is facing a new wave of violence and instability. The country has been plagued by conflict for decades, with armed groups vying for control of its rich mineral resources. The COVID-19 pandemic has also worsened the situation, with many people facing food insecurity and limited access to health care. The DRC government has taken action to curb the use of conflict minerals, but progress has been slow. The country has introduced a new mining code that aims to increase transparency and accountability in the sector, but implementation has been hampered by corruption and limited resources. The Enough Project’s report is one tool that can help hold companies accountable for their role in the conflict and encourage them to take steps to eliminate conflict minerals from their supply chains. “It’s vital that companies take concrete steps to ensure that their products are conflict-free,” said Kelly. “By doing so, they can help create a more peaceful and stable world and support the people of the DRC.” The Enough Project’s report will be available for download on its website on September 22. The organization hopes that consumers, investors, and policymakers will use the report to hold companies accountable and push for more action to eliminate conflict minerals from supply chains.","Source Intelligence hosts webinar with Responsible Sourcing Network on day of report's release CARLSBAD, Calif., Sept. 1, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The 2015 edition of Mining the Disclosures: An Investor Guide to Conflict Mineral Reporting by Responsible Sourcing Network (RSN) will be a much-anticipated deep analysis of filings by more than 1,400 companies to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) per a mandate on whether their products contain materials from war-torn areas of Africa. The Sept. 22 release of an authoritative study on current conflict minerals filings will include a live webinar to provide investors, suppliers, stakeholders and U.S. companies with additional insights into the research as well as recommendations to enhance compliance. The webinar, hosted by Source Intelligence (SI) in partnership with RSN, will feature Patricia Jurewicz, director of RSN, and Andrew Arriaga, lead report author, discussing details of research released that day. The webinar will also include supply chain transparency experts from Source Intelligence providing a look into current efforts by major publicly traded companies to meet or exceed investor expectations for responsible sourcing and regulatory requirements. The 2015 edition of Mining the Disclosures will introduce improvements to RSN's first-in-kind performance indicators for conflict minerals due diligence. It will rank 155 large cap companies among their peers, which are within 20 industrial sectors with high exposure to conflict minerals. The 2015 report will examine filings submitted to the SEC in June of this year. RSN's investor guide is at the forefront of social performance analysis, evaluating filings under Section 1502, the most sweeping social performance data requirements in the history of the SEC. RSN's report is designed to encourage a holistic approach to responsible sourcing and provide investors and stakeholders with deeper insights into social performance efforts by companies. From the original passage of the legislation, RSN and its partners have pushed for comprehensive, transparent, and standardized reporting. Source Intelligence is hosting the webinar because of its extensive experience and expertise in tracking and monitoring supply chains, validating conflict mineral data for companies. The unique open-source platform provided by Source Intelligence will allow suppliers to efficiently share sourcing reports. Source Intelligence was the most listed third-party investigative and verification resource by publicly traded companies required to file conflict mineral reports with the SEC. Register for the webinar here. BACKGROUND Under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, publicly traded companies based in the United States must report whether they use conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and neighboring war-torn countries. Militants in these countries are funding their war efforts through the sale of these raw materials. More than 6,000 companies were expected to file with the SEC. However, only a fraction submitted reports, indicating how little reliable information about tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (3TG) supply chains was available before the law was passed. Since its passage in 2010, Section 1502 has brought data and transparency to a trade in minerals whose extraction is often tied to appalling human rights violations. Despite regulatory and consumer pressure, many global brands have failed to commit to source conflict-free. Only two companies have determined all its 3TG products are conflict-free, with three others determining some product lines to be conflict-free. This has not come as a surprise to observers who understand that applying pressure onto the smelters that process the raw minerals is a complex and time-consuming endeavor. RSN's report highlights those companies that have done an exemplary job of this engagement. The conflict mineral issue has prompted thousands of companies to investigate other areas of their supply chain networks to ensure they are meeting ever-expanding sustainability, corporate social responsibility and environmental standards. Source Intelligence, for instance, is assisting companies in ensuring suppliers are providing materials and products without political corruption or slavery issues.

According to the documents released by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), a number of emails sent by Clinton via her private email server when she was Secretary of State contained information classified as “Secret” or “Top Secret”. The CIA has confirmed that it found instances where Clinton or other officials sent messages discussing sensitive matters that related to national security. The revelation could raise questions about the former Secretary of State’s handling of confidential material and could potentially damage her political ambitions. Clinton has previously said that she did not send or receive classified information on her personal email account, but she did acknowledge that her handling of the emails was a mistake. The latest developments may have a significant impact on the upcoming presidential elections.","Posted Tuesday, September 8th 2015 @ 4pm by Jenn Gidman, Newser Staff ( NEWSER ) – Since July, Hillary Clinton's team has been fighting findings by the intelligence community's inspector general that she housed classified information on her private email server. But a special intelligence review by the CIA and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency just bolstered the original proclamation, finding that two emails she received in 2009 and 2011 via that server were considered ""Top Secret,"" including an email about North Korea's nukes, the New York Times reports, citing senior intelligence officials speaking anonymously. Clinton's campaign is doubling down, however, with a rep accusing the discovery process of being tainted by ""bureaucratic infighting"" and a State Department spokesman proclaiming that ""classification is rarely a black and white question. … At this time, any conclusion about the classification of the documents in question would be premature.""

30,"The global contract life-cycle management (CLM) market is set to grow exponentially over the next few years, thanks to the emergence of cloud-based CLM, according to a new report from Technavio. The report predicts that the market will grow at a CAGR of more than 16% during the period 2015-2019. Cloud-based CLM solutions have several advantages over traditional on-premise software, including lower upfront costs, greater scalability, and improved accessibility. One major driver of this growth is the increasing use of cloud-based services across all sectors. Cloud computing is becoming increasingly common among businesses of all sizes, and CLM is no exception. With many companies adopting cloud-based solutions for all their enterprise software needs, it makes sense to include CLM as well. Another factor at play is the growing complexity of contracts in today's business environment. With contracts becoming more numerous, complex, and diverse, companies need reliable CLM solutions that can handle the entire contract life-cycle from creation to expiry. The rise of cloud-based CLM is also changing the competitive landscape of the market. With more and more vendors offering cloud-based solutions, traditional on-premise providers are finding it harder to compete. However, some established vendors are adapting to the changing market by offering both on-premise and cloud-based solutions. Overall, the emergence of cloud-based CLM is poised to revolutionize the CLM market and drive exponential growth in the global CLM market over the next few years. With many companies already seeing the benefits of cloud-based solutions, it's only a matter of time before cloud-based CLM becomes the norm.","Technavio has published a new report on the global contract life-cycle management (CLM) market, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 16% from 2015-2019. About the Report According to the latest report by Technavio, technology has evolved and contracts are now prepared in digital formats. However, lawyers and legal departments are still spending a significant amount of time reviewing contracts and carrying out renegotiations with the concerned parties. Therefore, the need to automate the entire contract management process has risen among companies worldwide. ""The deployment of CLM software will enable lawyers to view documents virtually in any format, including Word, Powerpoint, image, and Excel, and pull up similar contracts from a library for reference,"" says Faisal Ghaus, Vice President of Technavio. The latest report by Technavio also emphasizes the emergence of cloud-based CLM that has high potential as it offers an integrated solution to automate the entire CLM process. ""The cloud-based model reduces overall costs and helps enterprises cut infrastructural investments pertaining to contract management,"" adds Ghaus.

Butler made headlines during his freshman season at UCR when he scored a career-high 23 points in a game against UC San Diego, leading his team to a victory over their local rivals. The 6-foot-5 guard from Las Vegas will join a talented Aztecs squad that finished with a 23-5 overall record last season but was eliminated in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. San Diego State head coach Brian Dutcher praised the addition of Butler, saying ""We are excited to have Lamont join our program. He is a versatile guard who will add depth and athleticism to our backcourt."" Butler is the second transfer player to join the Aztecs this offseason, with former UTEP guard Keonte Kennedy also signing on to play for San Diego State. The addition of Butler and Kennedy should provide a boost to the Aztecs' guard depth, giving Dutcher more options to work with as he looks to guide his team to another successful season. San Diego State is currently scheduled to open the 2021-2022 college basketball season against UC Riverside on November 9th.","Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports 1 Read 0 Comments The NCAA is reportedly investigating the San Diego State basketball staff for potential rules infractions, according to Gary Parrish of CBSSports.com. A source told Parrish the violations ""include possible improper benefits to prospects"" and that the NCAA, ""in theory,"" could ""charge SDSU with Level 1 violations."" It remains unclear which players or coaches were directly involved with the potential scandal. Per Parrish, Level 1 violations are infractions that ""seriously undermine or threaten the integrity of the NCAA collegiate model as set forth in the Constitution and bylaws, including any violation that provides or is intended to provide a substantial or extensive recruiting, competitive or other advantage, or a substantial or extensive impermissible benefit."" It isn't the first time that head coach Steve Fisher, who has been the head coach at San Diego State since 1999, has come under the NCAA's scrutiny. He was fired from Michigan in 1997 after it was discovered that team booster Ed Martin gave an extensive amount of money to several players, including Chris Webber, Maurice Taylor, Robert Traylor and Louis Bullock. Michigan also vacated its appearances in the 1992 and 1993 Final Fours, adding a major asterisk next to the Fab Five era. If Fisher is indeed implicated in another scandal, he may find other programs less inclined to offer him a job going forward. San Diego State could see some of its recent achievements—including six straight trips to the NCAA tournament—erased from the record books."
32,"A new report has highlighted the fact that fewer than half the people who were invited to take part in an NHS bowel cancer test actually went ahead with it. The test, known as the faecal immunochemical test (FIT), is a simple way of detecting the early signs of bowel cancer. According to the findings, only 47% of those invited to take part in the test actually did so. The test is part of the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme, which invites people aged between 60 and 74 to take part in the test every two years. While the uptake of the test has increased slightly over the last few years, the report warns that more needs to be done to encourage people to take part. Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK and the second biggest killer, but it can be treated successfully if caught early. One of the key reasons why people may not take part in the test is embarrassment. The test involves providing a stool sample, which some people may feel uncomfortable with. However, the report stresses the importance of overcoming this barrier, as the test can help to detect bowel cancer at an early stage when treatment is more likely to be successful. Another possible reason for the low uptake of the test is a lack of awareness. While the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme sends out invitations to those eligible, some people may not realise the importance of taking part. The report recommends that more needs to be done to raise awareness of the test among those who are eligible. Commenting on the findings, Deborah Alsina, chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK, said: ""It's really concerning that so many people are choosing not to take part in the FIT test. Early diagnosis of bowel cancer is crucial to saving lives, so it's vital that more is done to encourage people to take part in the screening programme."" She added: ""We need to tackle the embarrassment factor by making it clear that the test is simple, quick and easy to do. We also need to raise awareness of the signs and symptoms of bowel cancer so that people know when to seek help."" The report also highlights the need for more research into why some ethnic groups are less likely to take part in the screening programme. It suggests that factors such as language barriers, cultural beliefs and a lack of trust in the healthcare system may all play a role. Overall, the report stresses the importance of increasing the uptake of the FIT test, as bowel cancer is a serious condition that can often be prevented with early detection. By working to overcome the barriers that prevent people from taking part, it is hoped that more lives can be saved in the future.","More than half of people invited for a new NHS bowel cancer test did not take it up, despite the fact it could save thousands of lives, a charity has said. Cancer Research UK published data showing many people did not want the test, with just one third of those in poorer areas attending their appointment. More than half of people invited for a new NHS bowel cancer test did not take it up, Cancer Research UK said The NHS Bowel Scope Screening Programme, which is being rolled out across the UK, offers a one-off test to people aged 55. A thin, flexible tube with a tiny camera on the end is used to look inside the large bowel. Pre-cancerous growths - known as polyps - can be detected and removed before they become cancerous. A pilot study ran in six areas of England, including Norwich, Kent, Wolverhampton and Guildford in Surrey. The test is now being offered at more than 70% of bowel cancer screening centres across England. Data from the pilot, published in the Journal of Medical Screening, showed just a third of people in the most deprived neighbourhood went for their appointment compared with over half in the most affluent. More men (45%) took the test than women (42%) among the 21,000 people studied. Cancer Research UK believes the new test will c ut the number of cases of bowel cancer by a third and deaths from the disease by 43%. Bowel cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in the UK, with around 16,200 people dying each year. Some 95% of cases are among the over-50s. Dr Christian von Wagner, from University College London, said given it was early days, researchers were encouraged by the numbers who attended. He said: ""There are lots of reasons why people, wherever they live, might not have the test - and these can include practical barriers such as embarrassment about the procedure or problems taking time off work to keep the appointment. ""We're doing more research to uncover these reasons and see what can be done to encourage as many eligible people as possible to take part."" Dr Julie Sharp, head of health and patient information at Cancer Research UK, said: "" You don't need to have symptoms for this test to be effective, but people can choose whether or not to have it and it's important that they receive clear information so they can decide what's right for them."" Dr Anne Mackie, Public Health England's director of screening, said the screening had ""a role in preventing bowel cancer by identifying any abnormalities, at an early stage, that could develop into bowel cancer if not detected"". The screening programme will be fully rolled out by 2018. It will run alongside the DIY postal stool test, which is sent every two years to people aged 60 to 74 in England. People over 74 can still request this test from the bowel cancer screening telephone helpline. Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved."
33,"In a new announcement that has shocked both his colleagues and constituents, Joe Hockey - former Treasurer of Australia - has revealed that he will be quitting Parliament after a reshuffle. This announcement was made public at a press conference held earlier today, during which Hockey stated that he has decided to step down from his role as a Member of Parliament. Hockey gave no reason for his decision, simply stating that it was a personal choice and that he felt it was the right time for him to leave politics. “My decision to leave parliament was not an easy one, but after much consideration, I have decided that it is time for me to move on and explore new opportunities,"" said Hockey. Joe Hockey has had a long and notable career in Australian politics, serving as the Shadow Minister for Health and Ageing, as well as the Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. Hockey was also the Treasurer of Australia under former Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s administration. During his tenure as Treasurer, Hockey was responsible for introducing a number of key economic policies, such as the abolition of carbon and mining taxes, and an overhaul of the welfare system. Despite some controversy surrounding these policies, Hockey remained steadfast in his belief that they were necessary for the betterment of the country. At this point, it remains unclear what Hockey’s future plans are. While some have speculated that he may be leaving politics altogether to pursue a career in the private sector, others believe that he may have his sights set on a new political role. Whatever his next move, Hockey's departure from Parliament is sure to leave a vacuum that will be felt by many. The news of Hockey's resignation comes on the heels of a major reshuffle within the Liberal Party, following the ousting of former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Hockey is just one of several high-profile figures who have left or been forced out of the party in recent weeks, including former Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and former Prime Minister Tony Abbott. As news of Hockey's departure spreads, there has been an outpouring of support from both sides of the political aisle. Many have praised his dedication to public service and his commitment to improving the economy, while others have highlighted his more controversial policies. Regardless of how one feels about his legacy, it is clear that Joe Hockey has left a lasting impact on Australian politics. His departure leaves many questions unanswered about the future of the Liberal Party, and whether or not they will be able to fill the void left by Hockey's absence. Only time will tell what the future holds for Joe Hockey, and for Australian politics as a whole. However, with a legacy as strong and as varied as his, it is certain that he will continue to have an impact on Australia, long after his time in Parliament has come to an end.","JOE Hockey has issued a statement announcing his intention to resign as the member for North Sydney. The announcement comes as Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull ousted the Abbott faithful from his front bench in a reshuffle. Rumors that Scott Morrison will move into the Treasurer role have been confirmed. ABC is also reporting that Employment Minister Eric Abetz has been sent to the backbench in favour of Senator Michaelia Cash. Joe Hockey Statement Sunday, 20 September 2015 After having served for nearly twenty years as the Member for North Sydney and seventeen years on the frontbench, I advised the Prime Minister that I did not wish to continue as a minister in the Government and that it is my intention to resign from the House of Representatives. It has been a great honour to serve my local community as the second longest serving Member for North Sydney since Federation. I have no desire to break Billy Hughes' record! It was a great privilege to serve on the frontbench. In each and every ministry from Financial Services to Employment and Workplace Relations, from Small Business and Tourism to Treasurer, I have sought to do my very best for the people of Australia. I will have more to say in due course, but for the sake of my young family - to whom I owe so much - I have decided to bring my parliamentary career to a close.

34,"An FFA member in the High Plains region recently received a special gift through the Give the Gift of Blue program. Kaitlyn Johnson, a member of the local FFA chapter, was surprised to find out that she had been chosen to receive 1,000 Blue Jackets through the program. The program, which is run by the National FFA Organization, provides jackets to FFA members who may not be able to afford them on their own. Johnson, who comes from a family of limited financial means, had been borrowing a jacket from the chapter for events and competitions. Now, with her own Blue Jacket, she feels even more proud to be a member of the FFA. ""I never thought I would have my own Blue Jacket,"" Johnson said. ""It means a lot to me and my family."" The Give the Gift of Blue program was started in 2014 and has since provided thousands of jackets to FFA members across the country. The jackets are a symbol of the organization and are worn by members at events and competitions. ""We started the program to help ensure that all FFA members have access to a jacket,"" said Melissa Beck, director of the program. ""It's important for them to feel a sense of belonging and pride in wearing the Blue Jacket."" The program is funded by donations from individuals and businesses, and the jackets are distributed based on need. FFA advisors and chapter leaders can nominate members who may benefit from the program. ""It's a great feeling to see the impact that this program has on students,"" said Beck. ""For many of them, receiving a Blue Jacket is a life-changing experience."" Johnson is grateful for the opportunity to now have her own jacket and hopes that other members in her chapter can also benefit from the program. ""I want to thank everyone involved in the Give the Gift of Blue program,"" she said. ""It really does make a difference in the lives of FFA members."" The High Plains FFA chapter is just one of many across the country that has received jackets through the program. The National FFA Organization hopes to continue to expand the program and provide jackets to even more members in need. As for Johnson, she is excited to wear her new Blue Jacket and represent her chapter and the FFA in style.","Recently, Casey Custer was able to zip up his very own FFA jacket for the first time. The junior, who attends Waterford High School in Waterford, California, was the proud recipient of the 1,000 FFA jacket through the FFA program, Give the Gift of Blue. FFA has more than 610,000 members nationwide; however, not all members own the esteemed blue jacket. In fact, more than 50 percent of FFA members don’t have an FFA jacket. This jacket is traditionally worn at official functions at the local level and for state and national conventions, competitions and special events. Many borrow jackets from the chapter or from past FFA members. The moment they zip up their own jacket is priceless. “The blue jacket means a lot to me,” Custer said, “as it represents the opportunity to gain experience and knowledge, especially as I play a role in our Waterford’s FFA Ag Mechanics team.” On Jan. 1, the National FFA Organization and National FFA Foundation began the Give the Gift of Blue program. Funded by individual donors and sponsors, the program provides members with blue jackets, which is part of FFA Official Dress. Members apply for a jacket by visiting FFA.org/GIVEBLUE to share their story of what the jacket means to them. Along with an essay, members also share information on what they have been doing in FFA, their communities and in their schools. “For so many, the blue corduroy gives a sense of belonging,” said Joshua Bledsoe, the chief operating officer for the National FFA Organization. “Thanks to this program, we are able to bring this sense of pride and belonging to more of our members, who are part of our FFA family.” Along with applying for a jacket, now others can nominate members they believe should be gifted a jacket. “We’ve had so much success with the program,” said Lee Anne Shiller, merchandise and membership services division director at national FFA. “We thought this would be a nice addition to the program and let others share stories of what our FFA members are accomplishing.” The funding for the program is thanks to corporate sponsors—CSX Transportation, Valent U.S.A. Corporation and their parent company Sumitomo, Ram Trucks, Tractor Supply Company—and donations from individuals. In addition, an endowment created by Donald and Mira Ball continues to fund the program as well. For more information on how to donate to the program, visit at FFA.org/GIVEBLUE . The National FFA Organization provides leadership, personal growth and career success training through agricultural education to 610,240 student members who belong to one of 7,665 local FFA chapters throughout the U.S., Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands."

36,"A British man had a terrifying experience on Monday when he fell down an open sewer manhole in Bangkok. The incident occurred at around 8:30 pm as the man, whose identity has not been revealed, was walking along a sidewalk near the popular Nana Plaza entertainment district. Eyewitnesses say that the man suddenly disappeared from view and let out a loud scream as he plummeted down the manhole. People nearby rushed to his aid and called the emergency services. Rescue teams from the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) arrived on the scene within minutes and found the man lying at the bottom of the manhole, about three meters below ground level. Fortunately, he was conscious and able to speak, although he had suffered some injuries. The man was immediately taken to a nearby hospital, where he received treatment for cuts and bruises, as well as a broken arm. Doctors say that he is now in a stable condition and is expected to make a full recovery. The cause of the accident is not yet known, and the BMA says that it is investigating the incident. However, locals say that the area where the man fell is notorious for its poorly-maintained infrastructure, including open manholes and broken paving stones. This is not the first time that a foreigner has fallen down a manhole in Bangkok. In 2017, a Russian tourist suffered serious injuries after he fell into an open sewer while walking near the Khao San Road backpacker district. The incident has raised concerns about the safety of pedestrians in Thailand's capital city, especially foreigners who may not be familiar with the hazards of navigating the city's streets and sidewalks. The British Embassy in Bangkok has issued a warning to British tourists visiting the city, urging them to exercise caution when walking on the streets and sidewalks. In a statement, the embassy said: ""We are aware of the incident involving a British national who fell down a manhole in Bangkok. We would like to remind British tourists to exercise caution when walking on the streets and sidewalks, especially at night, and to be aware of the potential hazards that may be present."" Local authorities have also issued a statement, saying that they will be taking steps to improve the safety of the city's sidewalks and infrastructure. The BMA says that it will be conducting a survey of the city's manholes and will be repairing and replacing any that are found to be damaged or in need of maintenance. The incident has also sparked a debate online about the safety of pedestrians in Bangkok and the wider issue of urban infrastructure in Thailand. Many people have criticized the government for failing to invest in proper maintenance and development of the city's infrastructure, while others have called for responsible behavior from both pedestrians and authorities alike. One thing is clear: incidents like this highlight the need for increased awareness and action when it comes to pedestrian safety in Bangkok and other cities in Thailand. With the right measures in place, tragedies like this can be prevented, and people can walk the streets and sidewalks of Bangkok with confidence and peace of mind.","Paul John Miller, 46, fell into sewer hole in Pathum Thani as he was waling with friends home on Tuesday night. The injured British man said the three-metre hole was left open with no warning sign anywhere. After falling into an open manhole late at night, rescue workers were able to extract the UK national and send him to a hospital. Photo by Pongpat Wongyala ROAD SAFETY The ladder used to pull the man out of the hole. As he left a restaurant in Pathumthani in northern Bangkok with his friends late at night on Tuesday, Paul John Miller, 46, from the UK fell into a three meter deep sewer manhole. After the fall, he became stuck in chest-deep sewer muck. Luckily, his friends were able to call for help immediately . If he was walking alone, he might have been stuck down there for a while Local rescue workers were able to haul him out of the sewage and send him to a local hospital to treat the bruises and wounds that he sustained from the fall and the subsequent extraction . Ordinarily, the sewer manhole would have been covered by a manhole cover but a worker apparently forgot to place the manhole cover back on the hole after repairs . The man, who runs a local business, said he will file a complaint with the local authorities. In a similar 2014 case, another man fell into an uncovered manhole in Bangkok at night and, not as lucky as the UK man this week, drowned and died in the sewage muck. Bangkok city workers had accidentally left the manhole open after road repairs .

38,"A controversy has arisen over the sale of a council house in west Suffolk, after it emerged that local councillors were not consulted on the matter. The property, which is located in a quiet residential area, was listed for sale on a property website without prior notification to the council or those representing the local area. Such a move has raised concerns among local councillors, and residents have expressed their disappointment at what they see as a lack of transparency in the process. “The fact that this house has gone on the market without local councillors being informed is very concerning,” said one local resident. “Selling a council house in this manner can have a serious impact on the local community, and we would like to know the reasons behind the council's decision to sell this property so quickly and without consultation.” The council has defended its actions, stating that the sale was conducted through its usual procedures and that no special considerations were given to the property in question. However, this has been met with scepticism from some quarters, with concerns raised that this is simply another example of the council’s neglect of the local area. “For too long, the council has ignored the needs of local residents, and this move only reinforces this attitude,” said one local councillor. “Selling off council houses without proper consultation is not acceptable. We need to know the reasons why this was done, and we need to ensure that this doesn't happen again in the future.” Many residents have been left feeling frustrated at the lack of communication from the council, and have called for greater transparency in the decision-making process. “Residents deserve to be informed about what is happening in their local area,” said a spokesperson for a local residents’ group. “The council's decision to sell this property without consultation is a worrying development, and we call on the council to be more open and transparent about its dealings with the local community.” The issue of council house sales has become increasingly controversial in recent years, with concerns raised about the impact they can have on local communities. This latest controversy in west Suffolk only serves to underline the importance of transparency and consultation when it comes to such decisions. It is hoped that the council will take heed of the concerns raised and work to ensure greater engagement with local communities going forward.","Babergh criticised over sale of dilapidated council house Council house goes on the market PA Members of Nayland with Wissington Parish Council have written to officers at Babergh expressing their concern after the property in Bures Road, Wiston, which requires “complete refurbishment and modernisation”, was advertised with a local estate agent for £225,000. Parish council chairman Mary George said they were “extremely unhappy” about the lack of consultation and information. Last night, Babergh and Mid Suffolk’s head of housing Martin King defended the move but admitted that the relevant parish and district councillors should have been informed about it. He said “every penny” raised from the sale of the house would be ploughed back into affordable housing in the district. Meanwhile, Babergh councillor Bryn Hurren weighed into the debate describing the sale as “social cleansing”. He added: “There is a desperate need for normal people with low paid jobs to live in our villages. This house will become just another country mansion for the affluent.” In her letter, Mrs George questioned Babergh’s reasons for selling the house and complained that local people had been kept in the dark about the proposal. She said: “It is astonishing this rural location is now regarded by Babergh as too remote for social housing tenants despite the fact the most recent local needs housing development is not far away in Wiston Road. This sets a worrying precedent.” She said Babergh officers had access to parish council documents about local needs. “So it is astonishing they did not involve the parish council in any way during the recent viability review of the Wiston house,” she added. The council’s head of housing Martin King said the decision had been made after a rigorous assessment process and had been sanctioned by the council’s joint housing board and strategy committee. He said: “This is not about social cleansing but about making the most of the council’s assets in terms of delivering suitable affordable housing. We look at the cost of bringing a property back into use, the projected 30-year cost and demand. “In this case, the cost was very high, there was no parking and you have to drive to get to local facilities. “Every penny raised from the sale of that property will go back into the fund we have for affordable housing which is one of our strategic priorities. However it might not be in Nayland, which already has an affordable housing scheme.” Mr King said lessons could be learned from this case, adding: “In the future, we need to be clear that we are keeping local members informed once the assessment process has been completed.”"
39,"In an effort to combat the threat of the Islamic State (IS) in the region, Iraq has joined the battle, using American F-16 fighter jets to launch airstrikes against the terrorist group. The move comes after the Iraqi government reached an agreement with the United States to purchase the fighter jets, which are considered to be one of the most advanced and capable aircrafts in the world. According to reports, the Iraqi Air Force recently conducted its first successful mission using F-16s against a known IS target. The strike was carried out with precision, resulting in the destruction of the target and no civilian casualties. The Iraqi government has been working tirelessly to rebuild its military capabilities, which were severely weakened during years of conflict. Since the announcement of the procurement of F-16s, Iraq has been undergoing rigorous training to ensure that pilots have the necessary skills and expertise to operate the aircrafts effectively. The addition of F-16s to the Iraqi military's arsenal is seen as a significant boost in the fight against IS. The aircrafts are capable of carrying out a range of missions, including close air support, air-to-air combat, and electronic warfare. They also feature advanced radar and sensor systems, enabling pilots to accurately detect ground targets and track enemy movements. Furthermore, the use of American fighter jets for these operations sends a strong message of support from the United States in the fight against IS. The U.S. government has been actively engaged in the region since the beginning of the conflict, providing training and equipment to Iraqi forces and leading a coalition of international partners in airstrikes against IS. But the fight against IS is far from over. The terrorist group still holds significant territory in Iraq and Syria, and has continued to carry out attacks on civilians and security forces. The Iraqi government will need to continue its efforts to build up its military capabilities and work with its allies to completely defeat IS and restore stability in the region. In conclusion, the use of F-16 fighter jets by the Iraqi military represents a significant step forward in the fight against IS. The advanced capabilities of the aircrafts will provide Iraqi forces with a crucial advantage in their efforts to defeat the terrorist group and restore peace and stability in the region.","© Provided by IBT US f-16 Iraq conducted its first airstrikes against the Islamic State group Sunday, the U.S. Defense Department announced. Defense spokesman Peter Cook issued a statement saying the strikes were conducted using F-16 fighters. ""The first four aircraft purchased by the government [of Iraq] were delivered to Iraq in July,"" Cook said, part of the continuing effort to work with the Iraqi people to degrade and defeat the terrorist group also known as ISIS or ISIL. ""Today the government of Iraq announced that Iraq has conducted its first counter-ISIL air operations using F-16 fighter aircraft. We commend the Iraqi Air Force for its successful use of this cutting edge aircraft,"" Cook said. DoD Statement: Iraq conducts 1st counter- #ISIL air operation using F-16 fighter aircraft.

The four T159T1 warplanes are scheduled to arrive midmonth, Hakim Zamli, head of the Iraqi parliament's defense and security committee, told Rudaw.net Sunday . “The Iraqi military is better equipped compared to the past in terms of heavy weapons. With the arrival of these warplanes … it can be fully ready to defend itself and keep defeating ISIS on all fighting fronts,” he said. ISIS controls a wide swath of territory in Syria and Iraq. The U.S. coalition conducted a series of bombing missions against ISIS targets during the weekend in both Syria and Iraq. The Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve officials said eight drone strikes targeted near Raqqa, Mar'a and Tal Abyad in Syria. In Iraq, 25 strikes hit near Haditha, Hit, Kisik, Mosul, Ramadi, Rawah, Sinjar, Sultan Abdallah and Tuz. Heavy weapons, vehicles, tactical units and an explosives factory were among the targets destroyed. Earlier in the day, Syria warned Britain against getting further involved in military action in Syria, saying London had overstepped international approvals. The Syrian Foreign Ministry reportedly sent letters to U.N. officials that accused the U.K. of “interference” and of leveraging its “colonialist experience,” the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reported.

43,"Rahul Gandhi, the leader of India's opposition Congress party, has unveiled a new action plan aimed at shining a spotlight on the government's failures. The plan is intended to bolster the opposition's standing against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of key state elections in 2022. Gandhi's strategy involves highlighting the government's mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic slowdown, and rising unemployment. The Congress party will also focus on calling out the government for its failures in addressing farmers' issues, rising fuel prices, and inflation. In a virtual meeting with top party leaders, Gandhi said that the Congress party must take advantage of the BJP's incompetence and make people aware of the government's failures. Gandhi emphasized the importance of taking the party's message to the grassroots level and engaging with people at the local level. The Congress party has been struggling to regain power after suffering a series of losses in state and national elections over the past few years. However, with this new action plan, the party hopes to turn the tide and gain a foothold in key states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Gujarat.","NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi and some AICC representatives are scheduled to meet Congress chief ministers and its opposition leaders in state assemblies on Monday and review their performance and implementation of the promises the party had made in its election manifestos.

The central leadership may also brief the chief ministers and opposition leaders about the amendments proposed by the party to the Goods and Services Tax Bill. Apart from these, the meeting will frame an action plan for a nation-wide agitation against the Modi government's ""failures"" on various fronts, including failure to reboot the economy , curb inflation and create promised jobs, the source said. The meeting will firm up an action plan for ""highlighting Congress victory"" in forcing the Centre to reverse its proposed ""anti-farmer"" amendments to the Land Acquisition Bill and counter Centre's ""false propaganda on the 13 notifications"" it issued on the Land Bill."
44,"University of Miami football coach Al Golden is feeling optimistic after the team’s open week. The Hurricanes had time to rest and fine-tune their game plan before facing their next opponent, Virginia. Golden has been pleased with the team’s progress so far but believes the additional rest was beneficial for all areas of the team. “We had a good open week. We got a chance to heal up and address some fundamental things,” he said. One area of focus during the open week was the defense. Golden stated that the team was able to work on their tackling technique, a skill that will be crucial in their upcoming games. The Hurricanes have a 4-1 record and are ranked No. 11 in the nation. They hope to continue their winning ways against Virginia on Oct. 11. Golden credits the team’s success to their dedication and hard work. “Our guys have been very consistent in their approach. They’re buying in to everything that we’re doing,” he said. As the Hurricanes prepare for their next game, it’s clear that the open week was helpful in improving all areas of the team and preparing them for continued success.","Hurricanes coach Al Golden said the extra days off after UM’s last game Sept. 19 against Nebraska have allowed his players to get healthier — and get their “academics squared away. “I’m talking assignments that are due the next couple of weeks,” Golden said Monday in his press conference before the 7:30 p.m. Thursday game (ESPN) at Cincinnati. “We did a lot of those.” He said the Canes “hit the weight room [and] we really fixed the things that we needed to fix by position and unit.” Miami protected starting weak-side linebacker Jermaine Grace (shoulder/head) again during practice, Golden said, but insisted he is healthy and “full-go” for Thursday. “We’re being proactive with him,” the coach said. “We wanted to get him through [Wednesday] … and just let him go.

48,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged Hitachi, a multinational conglomerate based in Japan, with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Hitachi allegedly paid approximately $1.1 million to South African government officials and a political party in order to win contracts to build two power plants. The SEC also claims that Hitachi’s internal accounting controls were insufficient to prevent the bribes. “The FCPA prohibits companies from making improper payments to foreign officials to obtain or retain business,” said Tracy L. Price, the Deputy Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “Hitachi’s lax internal controls enabled its subsidiary to pay millions of dollars to a politically-connected consultant without any evidence that the consultant actually provided any legitimate services.” The SEC’s investigation found that Hitachi subsidiary Hitachi Power Africa (HPA) entered into a consulting agreement with a consultant who was “known” to be politically-connected in South Africa. The consultant was allegedly hired to help HPA win contracts to build two power plants in the country. However, the SEC alleges that HPA made the payments to the consultant, who then passed the money on to South African government officials and the African National Congress (ANC), the ruling political party in South Africa. The investigation found that the payments were made without any evidence that the consultant provided any legitimate services. Hitachi has agreed to pay $19 million to settle the charges. The company has also agreed to cease and desist from committing any future violations of the FCPA. However, Hitachi did not admit or deny the allegations made by the SEC. The SEC’s investigation was conducted by the FCPA Unit’s Andrew H. Warren and Lisa K. DeMarchi, as well as the Enforcement Division’s Paul G. Block, Jr., and supervised by Charles E. Cain, Chief of the FCPA Unit, and Stephan Schlegelmilch, Associate Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division. The FCPA is an anti-bribery law that prohibits the payment of bribes or other corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The law also requires companies to maintain accurate and complete books and records and to have adequate internal accounting controls. The SEC has brought a number of FCPA cases in recent years, particularly against foreign companies with operations in the United States. The SEC’s enforcement efforts have focused on companies in industries such as telecommunications, energy, and pharmaceuticals.","Washington D.C.--(Newsfile Corp. - September 28, 2015) - The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Tokyo-based conglomerate Hitachi, Ltd. with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when it inaccurately recorded improper payments to South Africa’s ruling political party in connection with contracts to build two multi-billion dollar power plants. Hitachi has agreed to pay $19 million to settle the SEC charges. The SEC alleges that Hitachi sold a 25-percent stake in a South African subsidiary to a company serving as a front for the African National Congress (ANC). This arrangement gave the front company and the ANC the ability to share in the profits from any power station contracts that Hitachi secured. Hitachi was ultimately awarded two contracts to build power stations in South Africa and paid the ANC’s front company approximately $5 million in “dividends” based on profits derived from the contracts. Through a separate, undisclosed arrangement, Hitachi paid the front company an additional $1 million in “success fees” that were inaccurately booked as consulting fees without appropriate documentation. “Hitachi’s lax internal control environment enabled its subsidiary to pay millions of dollars to a politically-connected front company for the ANC to win contracts with the South African government,” said Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division. “Hitachi then unlawfully mischaracterized those payments in its books and records as consulting fees and other legitimate payments.” According to the SEC’s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia: Hitachi was aware that Chancellor House Holdings (Pty) Ltd. was a funding vehicle for the ANC during the bidding process. Hitachi nevertheless continued to partner with Chancellor and encourage the company to use its political influence to help obtain government contracts from Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., a public utility owned and operated by the South African government. Hitachi paid “success fees” to Chancellor for its exertion of influence during the Eskom tender process pursuant to a separate, unsigned side-arrangement. Hitachi’s misconduct violated the books and records and internal accounting controls provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, Hitachi agreed to a settlement that would require the company to pay a $19 million penalty, and it would be permanently enjoined from future violations. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Jon Jordan and Thierry Olivier Desmet of the FCPA Unit in Miami with assistance from Kathleen Strandell, David S. Johnson, and Matthew P. Cohen. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Justice Department’s Fraud Section, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Integrity and Anti-Corruption Department of the African Development Bank, and the South African Financial Services Board. “We particularly appreciate the assistance we received from the African Development Bank’s Integrity and Anti-Corruption Department and hope this is the first in a series of collaborations,” said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s FCPA Unit.

52,"Kelly O'Dwyer recently sat down with Southern Weekly for her first interview since being promoted to Cabinet. O'Dwyer was sworn in as the Minister for Jobs and Industrial Relations, as well as Minister for Women, in August. As a mother of two young children, and a busy government official, O'Dwyer has a lot on her plate. When asked about how she manages to juggle so many roles, O'Dwyer said, ""It's about time management and being disciplined. I work hard to ensure that I prioritize effectively and manage my time efficiently."" In her new role as Minister for Jobs and Industrial Relations, O'Dwyer says that her focus is on creating more jobs and driving economic growth. ""My goal is to provide better opportunities for Australian workers and businesses,"" she said. ""We need to create an environment that encourages investment and supports job creation."" O'Dwyer also stressed the importance of workplace diversity and gender equality. ""Gender equality is not only the right thing to do, it's also good for business,"" she said. ""Encouraging more women to enter the workforce and promoting diversity in the workplace is not only socially responsible, but it also leads to better business outcomes."" As Minister for Women, O'Dwyer is committed to promoting female empowerment and combating gender-based violence. ""I believe in empowering women and girls to reach their full potential,"" she said. ""This includes providing access to education and training, supporting women in leadership positions, and combating violence against women."" O'Dwyer's appointment to Cabinet was celebrated by many as a step forward for gender equality in Australian politics. When asked about the significance of her appointment, O'Dwyer said, ""I'm proud to be the Minister for Women and to be leading by example. I hope that my appointment inspires more women to get involved in politics and to aspire to leadership positions."" Despite the demands of her job, O'Dwyer says that she makes time for her family and tries to maintain a work-life balance. ""Sometimes it's a tough balancing act, but I try to make sure that I spend quality time with my family and that I make time for the things that are important to me outside of work,"" she said. O'Dwyer's appointment to Cabinet has been met with both praise and criticism, with some questioning her qualifications for the roles she has been given. When asked about the criticism, O'Dwyer said, ""I'm focused on doing the job to the best of my ability and delivering results for the Australian people. At the end of the day, that's what really matters."" Overall, O'Dwyer is optimistic about the future and the role she can play in shaping it. ""I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and the positive impact that we can have on the lives of Australians,"" she said. ""I'm committed to working hard and making a difference, no matter how many roles I have to juggle.""","When Kelly O'Dwyer, a Liberal backbencher, fell pregnant in mid-2014 she could never have known that one year later she would be in cabinet and effectively juggling four full-time jobs: two ministries, motherhood and fighting off a rising Greens threat in the once-safe Liberal inner-city Melbourne seat of Higgins. When Kelly O'Dwyer, a Liberal backbencher, fell pregnant in mid-2014 she could never have known that one year later she would be in cabinet and effectively juggling four full-time jobs: two ministries, motherhood and fighting off a rising Greens threat in the once-safe Liberal inner-city Melbourne seat of Higgins. Or that as a nursing mother, she would be planning to attend next month's G20 finance ministers meeting in Lima with her four-month-old baby. ""It's no secret I'm also a breastfeeding mum as well so Olivia does travel with me because of it,"" she told Fairfax Media, in her first interview since being promoted to cabinet. ""You never know what's around the corner,"" she said. ""It's true to say I have a big workload but I'm really excited - there is a big job to do and I relish the task."" Ex-Liberal MP Sophie Mirabella, in opposition, also juggled a frontbench role and motherhood. She told Fairfax Media O'Dwyer's appointment would improve the breadth of cabinet deliberations and send a powerful signal to young women considering entering politics. ""We know that diversity improves decisions and outcomes and I'm delighted that a talented young woman and a mother of a young baby is now serving in cabinet,"" she said. O'Dwyer, out of favour with the former Credlin-Abbott regime, was made a parliamentary secretary in December while pregnant but looked set to languish in the outer-ministry for years. ""Credlin boasted widely that while she was there O'Dwyer would go nowhere,"" says one Liberal. That changed with last week's leadership coup, which has seen a rise in the number of moderates and women in cabinet. O'Dwyer ticks both boxes but shrugs off the ""moderate"" tag. ""I would describe myself as being a Liberal … I take a slightly dryer perspective on economics and I'm probably a bit more socially progressive."" O'Dywer is the first woman to be appointed to cabinet in an economic role. She takes on a turbo-charged combined portfolio of Assistant Treasurer and Small Business, previously held by Josh Frydenberg and Bruce Billson. The dual roles are a natural fit given her personal and professional background. ""I'm very passionate about small business, I come from a family that has been steeped in small business,"" she says. Her grandparents Gwen and Alec Dixon began the first of their businesses making and selling felt ties. This venture morphed into a milk bar and then a grocery store. O'Dwyer says her grandparents reflect the ""entrepreneurial spirit"" that she says is ""at the heart of Australia."" ""That's part of the great Australian story."" ""I really respect dynamic, entrepreneurial people who are prepared to take a risk and employ people,"" she said. In announcing her appointment to cabinet, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said that ""in effect"" she was ""the minister for revenue"" and ""responsible for the tax system"". But Treasurer Scott Morrison insists the budget has a spending and not a revenue problem. So what is O'Dwyer's job? She agrees with the Treasurer's priority of getting spending well below the current historic highs of 26 per cent of GDP. Any more debt, she says, will simply ""cannibalise"" the budget and ""starve"" the government of being able to deliver services. ""We want a strong safety net and that is what a strong economy can deliver."" ""We as a government want to be nimble, we want to focus on innovation and get the economic settings right that encourage more aspiration and opportunity."" How? ""We're only day five,"" she says refusing to give any indication of how the government might alter the tax mix. Her previous writings as one of the Coalition's ""Modest Members"" are more forthcoming and have argued for fewer taxes, collecting less tax revenue overall and improving the way the tax and benefits system interact so people are not penalised for working harder. O'Dwyer chaired the House of Representatives Economics Committee; a prestigious position given it regularly hauls before it the Reserve Bank Governor. Before she entered the Parliament in 2009 in the Higgins by-election she was a solicitor at Freehills and a NAB executive. But anyone performing a quick Google of her name would be forgiven for thinking her only past job is serving as an advisor to former Treasurer Peter Costello. ""Former Costello staffer wins Higgins preselection"" and ""Costello staffer wins seat"" are just two of the headlines heralding her political successes. O'Dwyer will be out to put her own stamp on the Coalition's new economic direction. ""I think it's fair to say Peter Costello is the most formidable Treasurer this country has seen,"" O'Dwyer said. ""To be able to call him a friend and a mentor is fantastic and he's certainly someone I will turn to for counsel,"" she said. ""But I will own my own decisions and I will be responsible for my own performance and people will judge me accordingly,"" she said. Follow us on Twitter Follow Latika Bourke on"

54,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Mulayam Singh Yadav have emerged as the biggest power thieves in Uttar Pradesh, according to the latest data released by the state electricity department. The data reveals that the two leaders have illegally consumed the highest amount of electricity in their respective homes in the state. As per the data, Modi's official residence in Delhi, which is in fact in Uttar Pradesh, consumed 35,000 units of electricity in the last six months, while Yadav's residence in Saifai, Etawah district, consumed a staggering 75,000 units in the same period. Their consumption is more than 20 times that of an average household in the state, which consumes only 300 units per month. The government has been cracking down on power theft in the state and the latest data highlights the seriousness of the issue. The state government has set a target of reducing power theft by 15% this year. However, the data shows that the state continues to lose around 30% of its generated power due to theft. The government is taking a number of steps to curb power theft, including the installation of smart meters and the formation of anti-power theft squads. The state has also introduced a scheme to provide free electricity connections to people living below the poverty line in an effort to discourage illegal connections. However, the success of these measures remains to be seen. The government is also cracking down on electricity bill defaulters by disconnecting their power supply. The government has identified over 2.5 crore defaulters in the state and has set a target of recovering over Rs 20,000 crore in outstanding dues. The issue of power theft is not limited to Uttar Pradesh. It is a serious problem in many parts of the country. The loss of revenue due to power theft is a major concern for state governments and is a hindrance to the country’s quest for energy security. The government is taking a number of steps to address the issue and reduce the losses incurred by state electricity boards. In conclusion, the latest data released by the state electricity department highlights the seriousness of the issue of power theft in Uttar Pradesh. The government is taking several measures to curb power theft, but the success of these measures remains to be seen. The government must continue to address the issue to reduce the losses incurred by state electricity boards and ensure the country’s energy security.","LUCKNOW: VIP districts getting 24X7 power supply in Uttar Pradesh are also among places with maximum power theft. And two districts on top of this dubious list are Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Varanasi and Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav's Azamgarh constituencies. In fact, both have seen a huge jump in line losses. In Varanasi, the line loss has gone up from 43.18 per cent to 50.13 per cent while in Azamagarh, it has risen from 56.84 per cent to 63.78 per cent. Despite the government's best efforts, the overall line losses in the state have increased from 42.12 per cent to 42.74 per cent, as per an internal assessment report of the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL). Banda, in Bundelkhand, tops the chart in terms of increase in line losses -from 40.91 per cent to 51.89 per cent. According to a standard benchmark set by the central government in its power reform proposals, the line loss should not go beyond 15 per cent of total transmission. Likewise, the state capital, Lucknow, which is represented by Union home minister Rajnath Singh, has registered an increase in cases of power theft from 36.33 per cent to 41.06 per cent. Alarmingly , even Noida, which is known for honest power consumers, has shown an increase in instances of power theft from 10.03 per cent in 2014 to 11.87 per cent in 2015. Neighbouring Ghaziabad too has registered an increase in power theft from 34.43 per cent to 35.79 per cent within a year. In Gorakhpur, the theft has gone up from 42.87 per cent to 50.61 per cent within a year. In Meerut, line losses increased from 34.03 per cent to 42.8 per cent. But cities like Gonda and Mirzapur have shown a remarkable decrease in power theft from 56.15 per cent to 36.23 per cent and 51.33 per cent to 36.67 per cent. The problem has been marginally improved in cities like Moradabad, Saharanpur, Agra and Aligarh where line losses have lessened by around 1 per cent. The problem of power theft, not surprisingly , stands in sharp contrast with the government's plans to in crease power supply in districts which register less than 15 per cent line losses by October 1. Chief secretary Alok Ranjan had last week asked the Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd to ensure an increased power supply in districts which show consistent improvement in line losses. The Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission, too, had taken strong exception to the instances of power theft while deciding to hold officials concerned personally responsible. Principal secretary Sanjay Agarwal said the situation was being watched closely. ""The corporation will take strict measures in districts which have registered an increase in line losses,"" the principal secretary said."
55,"The No. 9-ranked Akron Zips men's soccer team took advantage of UC Santa Barbara's mistakes to cruise to a 3-1 victory over the Gauchos on Sunday. From the kickoff, Akron looked determined to take control of the game. After a series of missed opportunities, the Zips finally found the back of the net in the 23rd minute when junior midfielder Carlo Ritaccio scored off a free kick for his second goal of the season. UC Santa Barbara tried to respond, but the Zips defense held strong and denied the Gauchos any clear-cut chances. Akron added to their lead in the 38th minute when freshman forward Will Jackson scored his first career goal to put the Zips up 2-0. The second half saw more back-and-forth action, with UC Santa Barbara putting pressure on Akron's defense, but they couldn't capitalize on their chances. In the 65th minute, the Gauchos were given a glimmer of hope when Akron sophomore defender Carlo Posso turned the ball into his own net, cutting the deficit to 2-1. But the momentum was short-lived as the Zips added a third goal in the 77th minute, this time from senior forward David Egbo who scored his team-leading eighth goal of the season. UC Santa Barbara continued to push forward in the final minutes, but the sturdy Akron defense held firm to secure the win. The Gauchos will be left to rue their missed opportunities, as they outshot Akron 17-10, but only managed to put three shots on goal. Meanwhile, Akron capitalized on the Gauchos' mistakes, converting three of their ten shots on goal. The win sees Akron improve to 5-1-0 on the season, while UC Santa Barbara drops to 3-3-1. The Zips will look to continue their winning ways when they take on in-state rival Ohio State next Saturday, while the Gauchos will face Cal Poly in their next game.","Sept. 26, 2015 GAUCHOS GIVE IT TO AKRON No. 9 Zips use UC Santa Barbara miscues for victory UC Santa Barbara's men gifted No. 9 Akron a couple of goals and struggled to get its attack rolling against the visiting Zips' defense Friday night, succumbing, 2-0, in front of 7,283 fans at Harder Stadium. Sam Gainford scored in the 35th minute and Stuart Holthusen in the 87th in Akron's return to Goleta for the first time since winning the 2010 NCAA championship on the Gauchos' field. The Zips (5-3-1) outshot UCSB, 13-6, and conceded just one shot on goal while testing goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg, who made seven saves to keep the Gauchos in contention, including a fine stop on Richie Laryea in the 37th minute and a diving save on a curling Nate Schultz attempt in the 57th. Akron's allowed UCSB little space to maneuver, forcing long balls over the top for Nick DePuy. The tactic didn't work, and the Gauchos were whistled eight times for offside. “It was certainly a disappointing result,” UCSB coach Tim Vom Steeg said on his school's athletics website. “We had high expectations coming into the game, and we didn't play well. It could have been a different game if we score on our opportunities in the first 5-10 minutes of the game, but we weren't able to connect a pass and get our offense going.” Both goals followed Gauchos turnover deep in UCSB territory. Gainfield picked off an errant back pass and scored on the rebound after Vom Steeg slid to stop his first shot. Holthusen corralled a deflected clearance and beat Vom Steeg to the far post from a difficult angle. UCSB, which was coming off a 4-2 romp Monday at UCLA, is home Sunday against San Diego."
56,"Houston-based offshore drilling contractor Vantage Drilling Company has received a notice of delisting from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The delisting notice, which was issued on August 3, 2021, is due to the company's non-compliance with the NYSE's continued listing requirements, specifically regarding shareholder's equity. Vantage Drilling Company has not yet disclosed how it will respond to the delisting notice, but the company has 10 days to submit a plan to the NYSE outlining how it plans to regain compliance. The NYSE requires companies to maintain a minimum of $50 million in shareholder's equity. However, Vantage Drilling Company's shareholder's equity stood at just $39.7 million at the end of March 2021. The company's financial struggles are not new. Vantage Drilling Company has been dealing with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a decrease in demand for oil and gas and, consequently, a decrease in demand for drilling services. Vantage Drilling Company has also been dealing with the aftermath of a corruption scandal in Brazil that involved their former CEO and other high-ranking officials. The scandal resulted in the company paying over $5 million in fines and penalties. Vantage Drilling Company's stock has been struggling in recent months. The company's shares have fallen by over 60% since the beginning of the year. The delisting notice is another blow to Vantage Drilling Company as it seeks to regain its financial footing. The company's management team will need to act quickly to submit a plan to the NYSE and to take steps to increase shareholder's equity and regain compliance. Despite the challenges that Vantage Drilling Company faces, the company has shown a commitment to improving its financial position. In a recent statement, the company announced that it had reached an agreement with its creditors to extend the maturity of its term loan and revolving credit facility. The company also announced that it had secured new contracts for its drilling rigs, which will provide much-needed revenue in the coming months. Vantage Drilling Company's management team will need to continue to take proactive steps to turn the company's financial situation around and regain investor confidence.","Vantage Drilling Company (NYSE MKT: VTG) (""Vantage"") received a notice dated September 14, 2015 (the ""Notice"") that the staff of NYSE Regulation, Inc.

57,"Cherokee County is mourning the loss of Shannon Fagan, a beloved storyteller and mentor, who passed away earlier this week at the age of 68. Fagan was a familiar face in the community, known for his powers of storytelling and his ability to connect with people from all walks of life. He had a gift for engaging people with his words and making listeners feel like they were right there in the moment with him. Fagan was born and raised in Cherokee County, and he spent his entire life here, taking on a variety of roles over the years. He was a teacher for many years, and he was known for his passion for education and his unwavering commitment to his students. He also worked as a journalist and a writer, and he was a beloved member of the local media community. But perhaps Fagan's greatest gift was his talent for storytelling. He was a master of the art, and he used it to bring people together, to educate, and to inspire. His stories often focused on the rich history and culture of Cherokee County, and he was an important voice for preserving the traditions and heritage of the area. Fagan was also a mentor, and he devoted much of his time and energy to helping young people in the community. He was always available to lend a listening ear, to offer advice, and to provide guidance to those who needed it. His kind heart and generous spirit will be deeply missed by all who knew him. Smothers, Fagan's close friend and colleague, remembers him fondly. ""Shannon was a true friend, and he brought so much joy and light into the world. He was an amazing storyteller, and he had a way of connecting with people that made them feel seen and heard. He was an inspiration to so many, and his legacy will live on through all of the lives he touched."" Fagan is survived by his wife of 45 years, his children, and his many friends and colleagues in Cherokee County and beyond. He will be deeply missed by all who knew him, but his memory will live on through the stories he shared and the impact he made on the lives of so many. A public memorial service will be held in his honor later this week, and the community is invited to come together to celebrate the life of this remarkable man. Donations in his memory can be made to the Cherokee County Historical Society, which was near and dear to Fagan's heart. The loss of Shannon Fagan is a tremendous loss for Cherokee County and for the world at large. He was a true gem, a gifted storyteller, and an inspiration to us all. His legacy will live on, and his presence will be deeply missed.","Heaven must have needed a great storyteller. It certainly gained one in Jimmy Smothers. The legendary sports editor of The Gadsden Times died Monday at the age of 82. He was a mentor to many sportswriters across this state, including myself. My earliest memories of meeting Jimmy came during my college days at Jacksonville State University. I was a sportswriter for the school newspaper, The Chanticleer, and I came into contact with Jimmy quite often at football and basketball games. He was a staple at many Gamecock sporting events. The thing I noticed about Jimmy that was so special was what I call the human touch. He always had a smile on his face when talking to someone, and that made people who didn’t know him feel at ease around him. He made them feel like a friend, and that’s something I’ve tried to emulate throughout my career. As my college years passed by and I was close to graduating, I became an intern at Jacksonville State University Sports Information. One day, JSU Sports Information Director Greg Seitz called me into his office and told me Jimmy had inquired about me, wanting to know if I would be interested in what he called a “full-time, part-time position.” I told him I was interested, so Greg, Jimmy, and I worked it out to where I would go to class in the mornings, work at JSU in the afternoon, and then I’d go to Gadsden to work a couple of nights a week. It meant a lot to me that Jimmy felt like I’d be an asset to The Times’ sports staff. Here was a beloved sports writing legend who took the time to make a young, aspiring sports writer feel as if he was on his level. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect the opportunity Jimmy gave me. He didn’t just give me a token desk job answering phone calls. He treated me as if I was one of his own. There were a couple of occasions where I even got to travel with him to cover Alabama and Auburn college football games. Truth be told, I was scared to death on those trips because I was hoping I would make him proud. Looking back now, those are some of the greatest memories in my career that I have. I really got to see him in action, and I got a first-hand account of how well respected and thought of he was by so many on a statewide level. The many gifts Jimmy imparted on me carried over to my first “official” sports writing job as the prep sports editor at The Anniston Star, and now as sports editor here at The Herald. When I learned of his passing Tuesday morning, I was heartbroken. I knew his health had been fading over the past several years, but even so, he still continued doing what he loved. His last column was published on Sunday. I think all of my colleagues who knew Jimmy on a personal level would say this. The greatest gift he imparted upon all of us in this profession was it’s not so much about the events you’re covering as much as it is about the people who are involved with them. That’s what makes a great story. Without a doubt, Heaven truly gained a great storyteller."
58,"Poverty is a well-known risk factor for ill health and poor medical outcomes, but a recent study indicates that it may also increase the likelihood of repeat hospitalizations. The study, published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, found that patients living in poverty were more likely to be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of their initial visit. The researchers analyzed data from over 500,000 hospitalizations and found that patients living in the poorest neighborhoods were 10% more likely to be readmitted within 30 days, compared to those living in more affluent areas. One possible explanation for this trend is that poverty can make it difficult for patients to access the resources they need to manage their health effectively. Patients living in poverty are more likely to have poor nutrition, inconsistent housing, and limited access to healthcare services. These factors may make it harder for them to follow discharge instructions, manage their medication schedules, and attend follow-up appointments, all of which can increase the risk of repeat hospitalizations. Another possible explanation is that patients living in poverty may have more complex medical conditions that require more intensive care. Poverty can be associated with higher rates of chronic disease, such as diabetes, heart disease, and asthma, which can be difficult to manage without consistent medical attention and support. Without adequate access to healthcare resources, patients living in poverty may be more likely to experience complications and require hospitalization. The authors of the study suggest that there are several strategies that healthcare providers can use to help reduce the risk of repeat hospitalizations among patients living in poverty. These include providing more comprehensive discharge planning, connecting patients with community resources such as food banks and housing assistance programs, and ensuring that patients have access to primary care providers and specialist physicians as needed. One potential approach is to implement hospital-based interventions such as transitional care programs, which are designed to provide support and assistance to patients as they transition from hospital care back to their communities. These programs can include home visits from nurses, medication reconciliation, patient education, and telehealth monitoring. By providing more intensive support to patients during the critical transition period, these programs may help to reduce the risk of repeat hospitalizations and improve health outcomes over the long term. In addition to healthcare providers, policymakers also have a role to play in reducing the risk of repeat hospitalizations among patients living in poverty. Efforts to address structural factors such as poverty, inadequate housing, and lack of access to healthcare can help to promote health equity and reduce the burden of preventable hospitalizations. Overall, the study highlights the importance of recognizing the impact of social determinants of health on medical outcomes, and underscores the need for more comprehensive and holistic approaches to patient care. By working to address the root causes of poverty and health inequity, healthcare providers and policymakers can help to improve health outcomes for all patients, particularly those who are most vulnerable.","(Reuters Health) – When patients are hospitalized more than once in the same month, it may have more to do with their income or education levels than the quality of care they received, a U.S. study suggests. Perhaps unsurprisingly, patients 85 and older are more likely to return to the hospital within 30 days of being sent home than people a decade or two younger, according to the analysis of data from Medicare, the U.S. health program for the elderly and disabled. But patients also have higher odds of returning soon after discharge if they lack a high school diploma, have limited income and assets or have health benefits from Medicaid, the U.S. health program for the poor. The findings suggest that Medicare penalties for what’s known as readmissions under the Affordable Care Act may in some instances mete out punishment for outcomes that are beyond doctors’ control, said lead study author Dr. Michael Barnett and senior author Dr. Michael McWilliams, colleagues at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. “Hospitals are being penalized to a large extent based on the patients they serve,” the doctors said by email. “Patients admitted to hospitals with higher readmission rates are sicker and more socially disadvantaged in a variety of ways than patients admitted to hospitals with lower readmission rates.” Under the current penalty system, Medicare deducts 3 percent from inpatient payments to hospitals with higher than expected readmission rates, the researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine. Expected rates are only adjusted for patients’ age, sex and recent diagnoses including the one from their hospital stay. In 2014, the second year of the program, about 2,600 hospitals were fined a combined $428 million for excessive readmissions, the authors report. To get a better understanding of how individual patient characteristics might influence repeat hospitalizations, the researchers examined several other variables Medicare doesn’t consider in determining expected readmission rates – such as education and income levels, marital status, employment, race and ethnicity, smoking status and drinking habits. They linked records from a nationwide health and retirement survey of Americans over 50 collected between 2000 and 2010 to data from Medicare claims from 2000 to 2012. The combined analysis assessed more than 8,000 hospital admissions. The researchers sorted hospitals into quintiles based on readmission rates. They found that at least half of the observed difference in the probability of repeat hospitalizations between hospitals with the highest and lowest readmission rates might be accounted for by patient characteristics not currently considered by Medicare. When researchers only used Medicare’s criteria comparing readmission rates, they found the probability of repeat hospitalization was about 15 percent at facilities with the lowest rates and about 19.5 percent at hospitals with the highest rates. But when they took another look using more criteria on patients’ medical, social and economic characteristics, the gap between hospitals with the lowest and the highest readmission rates narrowed to 16 percent and 18.4 percent, respectively, odds of repeat hospitalization. One limitation of the study, the authors acknowledge, is the data didn’t allow them to calculate how considering individual patient characteristics might impact readmission rates at specific hospitals. Even so, the findings suggest that the current Medicare penalty system for repeat hospitalizations may put facilities serving poor communities at a distinct financial disadvantage, Dr. Carl van Walraven, a senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in Canada, noted in an accompanying editorial. “Differences between hospitals in readmissions may be due to who is treated rather than how they’re treated,” van Walraven said by email.

59,"Credit rating agency, Moody's, has affirmed its ratings on 13 Japanese industrial companies after the outlook for the sovereign rating was maintained. The ratings agency maintained its outlook for the country's sovereign rating at A1 stable on 8 February 2021. Moody's affirmed the ratings for 13 Japanese industrial companies including Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Hitachi, Mitsubishi and Sony. The ratings affirmations reflect the agency's view that the companies will not be significantly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic and are expected to maintain stable credit profiles. The stable outlook also reflects the agency's expectation that the Japanese economy will continue to recover from the pandemic's impact gradually. Moody’s Vice President and Senior Credit Officer, Yukiko Asanuma, said “From a financial perspective, these companies have been showing resilience to the pandemic’s impact with improving profitability and solid financial discipline, despite the challenges of domestic and overseas business environments."" Asanuma also noted that many of these companies have sustainability and environmental initiatives that align with the government's goals for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The rating agency highlighted Sony's credit profile as ""strong"" and affirmed its A3 rating, citing the company's ""diversified business portfolio, improvements in profitability, and solid balance sheet."" However, Moody's warned that intensified price competition in the semiconductor business and the potential risks associated with the launch of new gaming consoles could impact Sony's credit profile going forward. Moody's also affirmed Toyota's A1 rating, citing the automaker's ""leading market position, solid profitability, and a strong balance sheet."" The rating agency also noted that Toyota's efforts towards electrification and carbon neutrality goals will support the company's long-term competitiveness. In conclusion, Moody's affirmation of the industrial companies' ratings is a positive sign for Japan's economic recovery and sustainability goals. Despite ongoing challenges, the companies have shown resilience and are expected to maintain stable credit profiles. The continued alignment with the government's carbon neutrality goals adds to the companies' positive outlooks.","TOKYO (Standard & Poor's) Sept. 17, 2015--Standard & Poor's Ratings Servicestoday said that it has affirmed its corporate credit ratings on 13 Japaneseindustrial companies: Canon Inc., Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp., NTTDOCOMO Inc., Tokyo Gas Co. Ltd., Osaka Gas Co. Ltd., Japan Tobacco Inc.,Toyota Motor Corp., Denso Corp., Toyota Industries Corp., East Japan Railway Co., Central Japan Railway Co., Seven & i Holdings Co. Ltd., and FUJIFILMHoldings Corp. We have also affirmed our ratings on Toyota Motor's domesticand overseas subsidiaries and Seven & i's domestic and overseas operatingsubsidiaries (see list below). We have affirmed our issue credit ratings onthose companies that have issued instruments such as long-term senior debt and commercial paper. These rating actions follow our downgrade of the sovereignrating on Japan to 'A+/Stable/A-1' on Sept. 16, 2015. The outlooks on thelong-term corporate credit ratings on the companies remain stable. The long-term corporate credit ratings on the 13 companies are either 'AA' or'AA-', thus exceeding the long-term sovereign credit rating. Under ourcriteria, if the sovereign rating is 'B' or higher, an entity can be ratedabove the sovereign rating if, in our view, there is an appreciable likelihoodthat it would not default if the sovereign were to default. The entity can berated up to two or up to four notches above the sovereign rating, depending onthe sensitivity of the entity's sector to country risk (see ""Ratings Above TheSovereign--Corporate And Government Ratings: Methodology And Assumptions,""published Nov. 19, 2013). Because we lowered the long-term sovereign rating onJapan to 'A+', we applied a stress test on the 13 companies to verify whetherour ratings on them can exceed the sovereign. The stress test incorporates ourassumptions including reduced revenues and earnings resulting from severe macroeconomic stress, a haircut to holdings of domestic marketable securities,a sharp increase in funding costs because of an assumed rise in interestrates, and lack of capital market access for refinancing. The companies passedthe stress test because they each have very high credit quality based onstrong businesses and sound financial standing. Accordingly, we havedetermined that our ratings on the 13 companies can exceed our sovereignrating on Japan. We view the regulated gas utility industry and the railway industry as having""high"" sensitivity to country risk, indicating they are highly sensitive to acombination of economic volatility and potential changes in legal andregulatory environments. Therefore, the maximum number of notches by which ourratings on Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas, East Japan Railway, and Central Japan Railwaycan exceed the sovereign rating is likely to be fewer than for othercompanies."

61,"Investors looking for a potentially lucrative long-term opportunity should turn their attention to infrastructure. With crumbling highways, outdated airports, and decaying public buildings, there is a tremendous need for investment in the United States' infrastructure. President Joe Biden has proposed a $2 trillion infrastructure plan that could reshape the industry, and savvy investors are taking notice. While the details of the plan are still being hammered out, one thing is clear: there will be huge amounts of money flowing into infrastructure projects over the coming years. The proposed plan includes investments in transportation, broadband internet, water systems, and more. These improvements would not only create jobs in the short-term but could also catalyze economic growth over the long-term. Investors have a range of options for investing in infrastructure. One option is to invest directly in construction or engineering companies that are likely to win contracts for government-funded projects. Another option is to invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on infrastructure. These ETFs hold a portfolio of companies that are related to infrastructure, such as railroads, construction materials, and utilities. The benefits of investing in infrastructure can be seen around the world. Countries such as China and Japan have invested heavily in infrastructure, and this has translated into economic growth. Investing in infrastructure is not a ""get rich quick"" scheme, but rather a slow and steady way to build wealth over the long-term. In conclusion, the proposed infrastructure plan could be an opportunity for investors to get in on a long-term play that could pay dividends for years to come. With the need for widespread improvements in the country's infrastructure, this could be an opportunity not to be missed.","at 05:00 AM EDT To try and offer some perspective between the demand for public works projects in ancient times and for infrastructure projects of today, I set out to see if there was any way of creating a cost comparison.

62,"New laws are set to come into effect across the country, which are designed to improve the quality of childcare providers and ensure children receive the best possible care. However, there are concerns among some industry experts that the new regulations will have unintended consequences, including nurseries taking in fewer children. The new laws come as part of a wider government initiative to improve the quality of childcare, following a series of high-profile cases of neglect and abuse of children in daycare settings. The regulations include strict new minimum requirements for staff training, background checks, and physical facilities, including the size of play areas and indoor and outdoor spaces. While many organizations within the childcare industry have welcomed the new laws, some have expressed concerns about the impact they may have on smaller nurseries. In particular, some experts have suggested that the increased cost of complying with the new requirements could force some providers to limit the number of children they are able to take in. ""It's a really difficult balancing act,"" says Emily Lawson, a spokeswoman for the National Day Nurseries Association. ""On the one hand, we want to see parents have access to high-quality childcare every day, but on the other hand, we need to be realistic about the financial pressures that smaller providers may face. If nurseries are forced to reduce their numbers, this could have a knock-on effect on parents who rely on their services."" Other industry insiders have expressed concerns that the new regulations may result in a decreased availability of childcare places. ""One of the things that we're seeing is that some nurseries are simply closing their doors rather than trying to keep up with the new requirements,"" says Tom Callaghan, a spokesperson for the National Children's Bureau. ""This is particularly worrying in areas where there is already a shortage of good quality childcare provision."" Despite these concerns, however, many experts still believe that the new laws are a positive step towards better childcare in the UK. ""There's no denying that there are challenges associated with implementing these regulations,"" says Aliyah Smith, a childcare consultant. ""But ultimately, we need to think about what's best for children - and that means making sure they're in safe, nurturing environments where they can grow and thrive."" Indeed, some nurseries have already begun to adapt to the new regulations, investing in staff training and upgrading their physical facilities to ensure they meet the higher standards. ""We've always been committed to providing the best possible care for our children, so we see these new regulations as an opportunity to really demonstrate that,"" says Gemma Watson, a nursery owner from Bristol. ""We're working hard to make sure that we comply with the requirements and that our children can benefit from the improvements."" Overall, it seems that the new childcare laws have the potential to bring significant benefits for children and families across the country. However, there will undoubtedly be challenges along the way, and it will be up to lawmakers and industry experts to navigate these effectively and ensure that all children have access to the high-quality care they deserve.","New laws doubling the amount of free childcare parents can get for three and four-year-olds could lead to many nurseries having to reduce the number of children they can take unless they receive further funding, a report has warned. The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said that many of its members are already running their nurseries at a loss and are having to subsidise them from their mainstream budget. The Government's Childcare Bill, which will double free hours from 15 to 30 hours for 38 weeks a year, could put them under further strain, with the union warning that it might mean schools move away from providing nursery education altogether. Two thirds (66%) of its members who answered a survey said they believed that increasing the provision of free childcare to 30 hours per week could mean they will end up reducing the total number of children they can take. Of these, three in five (64%) said they might reduce the amount of children they could accommodate by as much as half (25-50%). Just one in seven (15%) school-based Early Years providers believed increasing the number of free childcare hours was sustainable under the current plans. The survey of nearly 800 members - most of whom were head teachers - found the majority (58%) felt the funding they currently receive for three and four-year-olds does not cover their costs. Promoted stories Two fifths (40%) receive less than £4 per hour, while 32% get £4-£5 an hour, the report found. Most (80%) were cross-subsidising their funding from the rest of the school budget, which the NAHT said is not sustainable in the long-term and will become increasingly difficult with the other growing pressures on school budgets. More than half of respondents (54%) said that they simply did not have the capacity to increase the number of nursery education hours they offered. Most (53%) said the parents of children who receive free childcare hours do not also extend this with paid-for care. NAHT general secretary Russell Hobby said the union welcomed the principle of offering extended free childcare to working families, but has made four key recommendations for the Department for Education. These are to develop a national fair funding formula for nursery education and also to work with the sector to understand the issue of capacity and consider how to make sure that there is enough provision to meet demand. It also wants to ensure that schools have time to implement the policy, particularly if it means that they will have to reduce the number of children that they currently support, and for the Government to understand that the provision of capital funding is key to the success of the policy. ""We support the aspiration to offer extra free childcare to working families and we believe the plan can work but the Government now needs to keep to the commitments it has made about looking at funding and consulting with providers - otherwise some families could lose out,"" Mr Hobby said. ""The Government has to work with us to make sure that the policy becomes one that schools can actually deliver. ""NAHT has repeatedly championed the importance of Early Years care. Now we need to see proper planning and funding so that this policy doesn't fall short of its excellent intentions. Taking the first steps into a school environment is the most important stage of a child's education."" Extending free childcare was promised by the Conservatives in their manifesto, but questions have been raised about how it would be delivered. The scheme is planned to start from September 2016 and be fully implemented by September 2017. The Tories originally said the plan would cost £350 million a year, but Employment Minister Priti Patel has been appointed to chair a review of childcare funding, which she expects to deliver an ''uplift'' to the hourly rate paid by the Government. The Pre-School Learning Alliance, which represents 14,000 private, voluntary and independent groups, has previously warned the existing 15 hours a week of free childcare is ''grossly underfunded'' by the Government. Responding to the report, its chief executive Neil Leitch said: ""These findings clearly reinforce the concerns raised by the private and voluntary childcare sector about the potential impact of the 30 hours offer. ""The early years sector has been significantly underfunded for many years, forcing providers to find other ways to cover the cost of providing places. ""It's vital that government resists the temptation to rush out a policy that, while attractive on the surface, is simply unworkable in its current form."" A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We know that childcare is one of the biggest issues affecting parents. This is why we are working closely with the sector to deliver 30 hours of free childcare, and innovative childcare providers are being asked to come forward as the first in the country to deliver it from September 2016. Share article ""We have already committed to raising the average hourly rate providers receive, and are also undertaking a review of childcare costs to inform a new rate that is fair for providers and delivers value for money for the taxpayer."""

64,"A Georgia police officer and a homeowner were both injured in what officials are calling a ""complicated shooting"" that occurred early Monday morning. The incident, which took place in the city of Decatur, has left residents and law enforcement officials alike shaken and searching for answers. According to authorities, officers with the Decatur Police Department were responding to a call about a domestic disturbance around 3 a.m. when they encountered a man wielding a firearm outside of a home in the 300 block of Willow Lane. The man, whose identity has not been released, refused to comply with the officers' orders, leading to a confrontation that resulted in gunfire. During the exchange, one officer was hit by a bullet and transported to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The homeowner was also injured in the shooting and was found inside the residence. The extent of their injuries is unknown at this time. ""This was a complicated situation that could have ended much worse,"" said Decatur Police Chief Nate Miller in a statement. ""We're thankful that our officer is expected to recover and that no one was killed."" The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is leading the probe into the incident. Agents have been collecting evidence and interviewing witnesses in an effort to piece together a timeline of events and determine exactly what happened. Residents of the normally quiet neighborhood where the shooting occurred are grappling with the aftermath of the incident. Some expressed shock at the violence unfolding in their community, while others said they were grateful for the swift response of law enforcement. ""We're all shaken up,"" said neighbor Samantha Thompson. ""It's not something you expect to happen in your own backyard."" The incident comes amid heightened tensions between law enforcement and the public nationwide, as calls for police reform and accountability continue to grow. Officials in Decatur have yet to comment on whether Monday's shooting will prompt any changes in their department's policies or procedures. For now, the focus remains on the injured officer and homeowner as they recover from their injuries. As the investigation continues, community members say they are hoping for answers and justice in the wake of the incident. ""We just want to know what happened and why,"" said Thompson. ""We deserve to feel safe in our own homes.""","A police officer was shot and critically wounded Monday when he responded to a call of a suspicious person and showed up at the wrong house, authorities said. The homeowner was also shot in the leg and his dog was killed in what DeKalb County police Chief Cedric Alexander is calling a complicated shooting. Officers fired their weapons, the chief said, but it's not clear if the homeowner had a gun. Alexander said his department would typically handle the investigation since it did not involve a fatality, but because of the unusual situation, he asked the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to look into it. ""We did respond to the wrong residence tonight and then these other circumstances unfolded,"" he said. Alexander said the situation happened like this: A neighborhood resident called 911 at 7:34 p.m. to report a suspicious person and described a home to the dispatcher. Three officers responded to a house that fit the description the caller gave 911. The officers went to the back of the home and found that a screen door and a rear door were unlocked. ""That in and of itself would probably suggest to anyone that it is possible that there could be intruders inside, but it turned out not to be the case,"" Alexander said. ""Somewhere at the rear of that home, some things happened that have yet to be determined."" The officers had just entered the home when the gunfire erupted. ""There was gunfire, I just cannot tell you who fired and who did not,"" he said. An officer was shot in the leg and lost a lot of blood. He was rushed to the hospital and was undergoing surgery. The homeowner was also taken to the hospital. The homeowner's girlfriend was at the home at the time of the shooting and called 911. Derek Perez told The Associated Press that he reported the suspicious person. He said he was walking his dog when he saw a man knock on a neighbor's door and then just stand in the yard. He said he then heard a loud noise, a dog barking and didn't see the man anymore. There had been break-ins in the neighborhood recently, so he called 911, he said. Just as he was about to go into his house, he heard the gunshots, but they didn't come from the house where he had reported the suspicious person. Police were still investigating whether there was a burglary at the home where the suspicious person was spotted. All three officers have been placed on administrative leave. The shooting happened in a neighborhood about 5 miles from downtown Atlanta."
65,"Futures Down Ahead of Consumer Spending Data Futures contracts on major US stock indices are trading lower early on Thursday, as investors await the release of consumer spending data for May. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down by 0.28%, while the S&P 500 future contracts fell by 0.18% at the time of writing. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures also slipped by 0.13%. Experts say that the stock market movements suggest traders are becoming increasingly cautious and conservative, as concerns over inflation and rising interest rates continue to dominate the headlines. Investors are now waiting for the release of fresh economic data that could shed light on the health of the US economy, particularly consumer spending, which accounts for around two-thirds of the country's economic activity. The US Commerce Department is set to release May's retail sales data at 8:30 am ET. Economists anticipate that retail sales rose by 0.6%, following a 0% reading in April. Other data sets scheduled for release on Thursday include the Labor Department's weekly jobless claims report and the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index for June. Meanwhile, global oil prices continued to be volatile, with Brent crude futures dropping by 0.2% to $72.51 per barrel, while WTI crude futures were down by 0.3% to $70.31 per barrel. On Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve signaled that it was likely to raise interest rates earlier than previously anticipated, in response to inflation pressures that have been building in recent months. The central bank also announced that it would begin to reduce its asset purchases ""when the economy has made substantial further progress"" towards its goals of maximum employment and stable prices. Stocks initially surged on the news, as investors interpreted the Fed's shift in stance as a sign of confidence in the US economic recovery. However, the rally faded as concerns over the impact of higher interest rates on corporate earnings and economic growth resurfaced. The S&P 500 index closed the day down by 0.54%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.77% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped by 0.24%. Investors are now expected to closely monitor the economic data releases due later in the day for further clues on the direction of the market.","A sign hangs in front of U.S. flags outside of the New York Stock Exchange in New York (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were lower on Monday as investors awaited consumer spending data for August amid uncertainty around the timing of an interest rate hike. Several Federal Reserve officials are scheduled to speak this week, including New York Fed President William Dudley on Monday. The focus will firmly be on U.S. monetary policy after strong second-quarter U.S. GDP data released on Friday sharpened the case for a 2015 hike. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said she expects rates to be raised this year. Investors have been jittery trying to gauge when the Fed will raise rates amid concerns about slowing global growth. Data due Monday includes consumer spending data for August, which is expected to have risen 0.4 percent, compared with a 0.3 percent increase in July. The data is expected at 8:30 a.m. ET (1230 GMT). The week will culminate with non-farm payrolls data on Friday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed lower on Friday, wiping out gains from a rally driven by Yellen's comments about a rate hike, as a selloff in biotechs offset gains in banking shares. The Dow, however, ended higher as Nike hit a record-high after its first-quarter profit beat expectations. Shares of Alcoa were up 6.2 percent premarket at $9.49 after the metals company said it would split into two publicly-traded companies.

66,"Scientists have discovered that the combination of ionic liquid components affects the structure and property of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate-based zinc metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The research, published in the journal RSC, highlights the importance of understanding how different components interact to produce desired structures and functions in MOFs. The team analyzed the effects of adding different ionic liquid species on the structural and electrochemical properties of the MOFs. They found that the presence of certain ionic liquids led to improved electrochemical performance and increased surface area in the MOFs. The results suggest that the combination of ionic liquid components could be used to tailor the properties of MOFs for specific applications, such as energy storage and catalysis. This research paves the way for the development of new MOF materials with improved properties and performance.","Two types of 2D [RMI]2[Zn3(BDC)3X2] (Type A) and 3D [Zn(BDC)(H2O)] (Type B) (H2BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate acid) compounds were synthesized with three kinds of 1-alkyl-3-methyl imidazolium halide ([RMI]X) ionic liquids. Type A is the primary structure model showing a (3,6) network. Type B can be obtained from [BMI]Cl, [AMI]Cl and [AMI]Br media, showing 4,4-connected {42.84} network. The structure, TG, and fluorescence analyses demonstrate the combinational effect of RMI+ templating effect and X– controlling the structure types. The boundary between Types A and B locates from [PMI]Cl, via [BMI]Br, to [AMI]I as reaction media. The decomposition temperatures of the compounds in Type A decrease with the increased RMI+, while X– anions exert the influence that the compounds containing Br– supply the highest thermal stability. Similarly, with the increased RMI+, or X = I–, the compounds show red shifts compared to the emissions of the ligand."
67,"Cairns politician Billy Gordon will not face charges over a domestic violence allegation, police in Queensland have confirmed. The Queensland Deputy Premier said that the complainant, who was Gordon's former partner, had withdrawn her complaint. While the woman refused to cooperate with police, they said that they had ""conducted a thorough investigation"" into the matter. ""The victim has formally withdrawn her statement and as a result, no further action will be taken,"" police said in a statement. Gordon, who is a former member of the Queensland State Parliament, had always maintained his innocence and said that the accusations against him were ""unfounded and unsubstantiated"". The politician was accused of assaulting a woman twice in 2018. He was referred to the ethics committee for failing to declare his criminal history, but was able to keep his seat with the support of the Labor Party. No further comment has been made on the matter by Gordon, who has been contacted for comment by the Melbourne Age.","Controversial Cape York MP Billy Gordon will not face domestic violence charges in Queensland after an investigation could not find sufficient evidence. Mr Gordon, who was forced out of the Labor Party in March for failing to disclose his criminal past, said last month police had completed their investigation.

68,"Nike, the world-renowned footwear and athletic apparel company, has been steadily drifting towards lower entry points in recent years. The move comes as the company seeks to capture a greater share of the market and appeal to a broader consumer base. One of Nike's key strategies for achieving this goal has been to release more affordable products. For example, the company launched a new lower-priced sneaker line, called the Nike React Infinity Run Flyknit, earlier this year. These shoes are priced at around $160, which is significantly less expensive than many of the company's more premium offerings. Another way in which Nike has sought to appeal to a wider consumer base is by partnering with popular influencers and celebrities. For instance, the company recently collaborated with rapper Travis Scott on a collection of apparel and footwear. Scott, who has a massive social media following, helped to promote the collection, which was targeted towards a younger, more trend-conscious audience. Despite these moves towards lower entry points, Nike remains committed to its premium image. The company continues to release high-end products, such as the new LeBron James signature shoe, which retails for over $250. Overall, the shift towards lower entry points is a savvy strategy for Nike. By making its products more accessible to a wider range of consumers, the company can continue to grow its business and remain at the forefront of the global athletic apparel market.","Written by: Gary Morrow 09/28/15 - 2:26 PM EDT Tickers in this article: NKE NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Nike's powerful ramp on Friday, following its latest earnings report , pushed shares to fresh all-time highs. The stock gained nearly 9% on the news, extending its rally off the Aug. 24 spike low to more than 30%. Volume driving this huge breakout reached its heaviest level in a year. This very bullish action appears to have quickly lost its momentum as a new week begins. Nike is leaving behind an ugly spike high and will likely drift lower in the near term. For patient bulls, this will present a low-risk entry opportunity. Nike opened Friday with a powerful upside gap after investors aggressively bid up shares Thursday night. The stock easily cleared heavy resistance near the $117 area in the process. Nike had topped just below $118 last month and was stalling just above $117 last week as earnings loomed. This area now forms the upper band of support. Just below is the Friday morning gap at $115.15 which marks the bottom of this major support zone. For bullish Nike investors, a retest of this area will provide a very low-risk buying opportunity. Investors should focus on the $118-to-$117 area for new purchases. A continued drift on lighter trade down to this zone in the next few weeks should spark action. Click here to see the below chart in a new window."
69,"Arkefly's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steven van der Heijden, has announced the carrier's plans to implement a new In-Flight Entertainment (IFE) program on their flights. The company's new IFE system is expected to rollout on all Arkefly's long-haul flights by the end of 2021. According to Mr. van der Heijden, the new program will provide passengers with fast and reliable Wi-Fi, in-flight entertainment, and shopping options. ""We've been hard at work developing a brand new IFE program that will truly enhance the passenger experience. Our new platform will provide passengers with the latest in-flight entertainment, as well as the ability to stay connected with their loved ones on the ground,"" said Mr. van der Heijden. The new platform was designed to meet modern standards and customer needs. Passengers can use the Wi-Fi capabilities to connect their mobile devices to the internet while on board. They can also browse through the vast range of videos, music, games, and more that are available on the IFE program. Passengers will also be able to use the platform to shop for duty-free items during their flight. As the airline's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. van der Heijden is confident that the new IFE program will provide passengers with a far more engaging and enjoyable experience on-board. ""At Arkefly, we're constantly looking for ways to improve our customer experience and one of the critical areas that we believe will make a significant impact is improving our in-flight entertainment options. With our new IFE program, we're confident we're raising the bar for our passengers and providing them with a premium experience,"" Mr. van der Heijden added. Arkefly is an airline that caters to holidaymakers seeking sun, sea, and relaxation. It primarily serves destinations in the Caribbean and Mediterranean regions. The airline is committed to providing its passengers with high levels of comfort and quality of service. Mr. van der Heijden notes that the new IFE program is just one of several upgrades and innovations that Arkefly is currently implementing. He reveals that the airline is investing heavily to ensure its planes remain up-to-date with the latest technologies and amenities. ""We're committed to investing in our planes and our fleet to provide our passengers with the best possible flying experience. Our new IFE program is just the first of many new features and upgrades that we'll be rolling out in the coming months and years,"" said Mr. van der Heijden. In conclusion, Arkefly's new IFE program is set to revolutionize the way passengers experience long-haul flights. With faster Wi-Fi, a vast range of in-flight entertainment options, and the ability to shop during the flight, passengers will be able to enjoy a more indulgent and comfortable flight experience. The airline's commitment to providing its passengers with quality service continues to be a top priority, and the new IFE program is just one of many investments that they are making towards that goal.","At this week’s Aviation Festival in London, Arkefly Managing Director Hans van de Velde outlined the success of the TUI Cloud streaming IFE pilot program for personal electronic devices, that was fully deployed across the airline’s fleet over a three-month period. At the conference, he also hinted that the entire TUI family of 140 active aircraft (comprising the fleets of Thomson Airways, TUIfly, Arkefly TUI Nordics and Jetairfly) might also be on a fast track to implement TUI Cloud – supported by the AirFi battery- powered Wi-Fi box – as part of the “One Aviation” carrier consolidation project underway within TUI Group. “It took us literally two minutes to convince our board last week, Wednesday, that this is a very quick and easy solution,” he told delegates. “We definitely want, within all TUI Group airlines, to harmonize the inflight experience as much as we can,” van de Velde said, in a question-and-answer outline of the program, released this week. “The rest of the group is watching closely, because at the end of this year we need to have a group-wide strategy in place to harmonize the On-Board Customer Experience.” In early April of this year, the company began working with AirFi with a goal to have the boxes aboard aircraft by early July. Thus began a detailed preparation with MI Airline , makers of the AirFi product, which also makes a cabin management system called Connected Crew. Also involved was the airline caterer Newrest where the AirFi boxes are stored, charged and uploaded. “At this moment the boxes are being stored, charged and uploaded in Amsterdam and we are using them only onboard,” said van de Velde. “ The next step might be that we roll out within the airports and our hotel transfer buses as well. We did a successful trial on the buses in mid-August. The inflight IFE from the AirFi boxes should amount to considerable savings over an installed IFE solution for Arkefly. There is no need for the carrier to obtain a FAA Supplemental Type Certificate. Later this fall, the boxes will replace the overhead IFE system on the airline’s 737. Content in the AirFi boxes includes daily newspapers, current magazines and the Arkefly inflight magazine. Also in the content are interactive games, destination information and videos. In the future van de Velde said he would like to roll out more digital rights managed material. Arkefly is also testing an ordering process where passengers on medium and long haul flights can order food through their mobile devices. “Normally on these flights, we have two café services,” explained van de Velde. “During the trials, we still did the first service, but the second one was removed and passengers were asked instead to order using the TUI Cloud systems supported by the AirFi boxes.” Since the rollout this past summer Arkefly has seen an average take rate of approximately 22% for the system and between 25,000 and 35,000 page views per day. Job Heimerikx, CEO of MI Airline, said such information will be important for future data management by Arkefly. “Every click, every movement, every page view duration is being stored,” Heimerikx said. “We can provide the airline with data showing what content is being viewed on which flight, how many times and for how long. This helps them optimize the experience and decide which content stays on and what needs to go. They can also test out different menu structures to see what produces better sales figures.”"
70,"Living in London is expensive. But the latest housing trend takes that statement to a new and strange level. Enter ""micro-flats"" or ""pod flats"" a solution to the city's housing crisis, that are popping up all over London and allowing renters to live in, quite literally, boxes. While they may seem compact and efficient at first glance, there's no denying that there's something dystopian about living in such a small space. These pod flats consist of a box-like structure, which often features a bed, a desk, and a small kitchenette, all within a space of just a few square meters. The latest micro-flats were launched last month in London with a price tag of £650 ($800) per month. Called ""BoKlok"", these flats boast two modules with 26 square meters of total living space, complete with a mini-kitchen, tiny living space, and a separate bathroom pod. The space is designed to be foldable, meaning that in future it can be transported or reused elsewhere. Many experts argue that these micro-flats are a quick fix to London's pressing housing crisis. According to recent statistics, one in three households living in London pays more than half their income on rent. And with house prices rising and salaries remaining fairly stagnant, many Londoners are finding it increasingly difficult to find suitable and affordable accommodation. However, critics argue that these micro-flats are nothing short of inhumane. London's Mayor, Sadiq Khan, called them ""grossly inappropriate"" and ""an unacceptable way of squeezing people into tiny homes"". ""Far from providing an affordable solution, these micro-flats are nothing more than living quarters akin to those typically found in developing countries,"" said Khan in a statement. ""It is entirely unacceptable to put people in such cramped and uncomfortable spaces."" And it's not just housing campaigners and politicians who object to the micro-flats. There's also the question of their environmental impact. Micro-flats are highly resource-intensive to produce, often using materials that are not particularly sustainable. And with developers often maximizing the available space in each pod, there's little room for the kind of green design that could help to make these incredibly compact living spaces more eco-friendly. Despite all these concerns, developers continue to churn out micro-flats. There's clearly a demand for them, with many people feeling that living in an inhumane pod flat is better than not having a home at all. But it's worth thinking about the long-term implications of such a solution. As rents continue to rise and the housing crisis in London deepens, it's not clear where we go from here. But one thing's for sure: micro-flats may be a solution of sorts, but they're not without their controversies. Until a more sustainable and equitable solution is found, however, they look set to remain a source of heated debate in the UK capital.","The shed is circled in case you cannot see the shed.

A shed—a shed, remember, is a specialist wooden box for dads to cry in and a place for normal people to keep their old plant pots and bikes—but it has been erected not in a garden but in a front room, painted an inoffensive shade of off-white, nestled behind the sofa. It's like looking at a whale carefully hidden in an airplane, or a lamppost coming out of a frog—something anonymous and boring, rendered insane by its context. This was the discovery made by flathunter Joe Peduzzi when he went along to a SpareRoom viewing in Bethnal Green. ""'When I first walked in I sort of noticed the shed in the background but didn't really take it in,"" he said, after the viewing. ""Then I scanned around the room and couldn't see a bed so I asked where it was and the guy just pointed to the corner. I stuck my head in for a look but there was basically no room for movement. The mattress was right against the walls of this shed and the windows were blacked out.""

You're just a child, lost and alone and sitting in the dark in a locks-from-the-inside shed, and you think you're independent but you're not, and your job didn't turn out as good as you thought it would be, did it, and nothing really worked out how you envisioned it, and the nights are drawing in—close and dark and cold—and it's just you, in your Sonic pajamas, trying not to alert your housemates to the fact that you're trying to escape the doom with a cheeky shed-wank, trying not to move the mattress around too much as you try to manipulate your genitals because the mattress makes a sort of creaking sound against the side of your shed and they know, they know.

""I didn't ask what the story behind it was but he seemed to think it was pretty normal."" Similarly, SpareRoom director Matt Hutchinson was pretty blasé about the whole thing. ""We're no strangers to quirky ads but this one puts a whole new spin on the phrase 'beds in sheds,'"" he told the Mail , invoking a phrase literally nobody has ever used. ""There's no clear reason given for putting a bed inside a shed, inside a bedroom, but it could be because the other housemates use the room as communal space.

71,"The ongoing controversy over transferring trade union leaders without their consent has sparked a heated debate among legal experts and trade unions in India. Recently, the Madras High Court has ruled that such transfers are against the law and the workers have the right to challenge them. The issue arose after several employees of a public sector undertaking were transferred arbitrarily without adequate reasons. This led to a legal challenge by their union, which argued that the transfers were illegal and violated the workers' fundamental rights. The Madras High Court agreed with the union, stating that ""the transfer of workers without consultation with their union is against the law and a blatant violation of their constitutional rights."" Trade union leaders across the country have welcomed the verdict, calling it a victory for workers' rights. They have urged the government and employers to respect the rights of workers and form a consultative mechanism to address such issues in the future. Overall, the verdict is expected to have a significant impact on the way trade unions and employers work together in India. It is hoped that this will lead to a more collaborative and respectful workplace, where the rights of workers are protected.","Comment · print · T T T+· T- Stating that the Salem Steel Plant’s decision to transfer three trade unions leaders for participating in the nationwide strike on September 2 is curbing the democratic right and against the law, members of various trade unions demanded that the State government and the district administration interfere in the issue and put an end to the in-house protest by a group of employees. An emergency meeting was held at the CITU district committee office here on Friday to discuss the next course of action. A joint statement was issued that said that 15 crore workers participated in the strike across the country on September 2. Most of the workers at Salem Steel Plant participated in the strike. However, the administration, in order to punish the workers, transferred the leaders of CITU, INTUC, LPF, to Delhi, Chennai and Poolampatty. Hence, condemning the decision, workers voluntarily stopped work and were involved in sit-in-protest on the premises from September 3."

74,"India's Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises has ordered an investigation into Volkswagen (VW) cars in the country following reports of alleged emission cheating. The probe will be conducted by the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI). The ministry has directed ARAI to evaluate whether the German automaker has installed ""defeat devices"" in its diesel cars to cheat emissions tests, as it did in the United States and other countries. The ministry reportedly cited an ""international study"" in its directive, but it did not provide further details. Volkswagen India has denied any wrongdoing and said in a statement that its cars comply with Indian regulations. ""We have not received any communication from the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises yet. We will fully cooperate with the authorities whenever we hear from them,"" the company said. The development comes months after the Indian environment ministry fined Volkswagen India over Rs 561 crore ($78 million) for installing the ""defeat devices"" in its diesel cars. The fine was the largest ever imposed on an automaker in India. The company had challenged the fine in the National Green Tribunal (NGT), but the tribunal dismissed its plea in November 2018. The NGT upheld the fine and directed Volkswagen to pay within 30 days. Volkswagen India has been struggling to revive its sales in the country, which have been hit by a global backlash against diesel cars following the emissions cheating scandal. The company has been investing heavily in electric vehicles and other green technologies to address the issue, but its strategy has yet to bear fruit. The Indian market is crucial for Volkswagen, as the country is expected to become the world's third-largest passenger vehicle market by 2021. The company currently has a market share of about 1% in India, but it aims to increase it to 3% within the next five years. However, the latest probe and the fine may further dent its image and sales in the country.","The government has ordered an investigation into Volkswagen AG cars after the German automaker said it had used software in its diesel models to circumvent emissions tests in the United States. U.S. regulators last Friday said the world's top automaker by sales had installed ""defeat device"" software in models such as the Jetta, Beetle and Golf to lower emissions during testing. In normal conditions, the emissions exceeded permitted limits. India's government has instructed state-run testing agency Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) to evaluate whether Volkswagen cars sold domestically similarly violated any pollution laws, which are less stringent than the U.S. What's going on with Volkswagen's diesel scandal? https://t.co/01PgoL0q3n — The Verge (@verge) September 25, 2015 ""We have written to the ARAI to find out whether Volkswagen is selling the same models in India that have been found violating U.S. rules,"" Ambuj Sharma, additional secretary at the Ministry of Heavy Industry, told Reuters. ""ARAI has been asked to submit its report within a week."" The government has not yet sought clarification from the automaker and will wait for the report before taking any further action, the official said. ""We want to know if what happened in the U.S. could happen in India or not,"" said another senior official at the ministry. Volkswagen could not be reached for comment on Friday, a national holiday in India. Under Indian regulation, Euro IV auto pollution standards apply for vehicles sold in 50 cities, while Euro III standards apply in rest of the country. Volkswagen made about 107,000 vehicles in India in the year through March of which it exported nearly two-thirds. It plans to raise capacity in the country to 200,000 vehicles by 2018. If VW is found to have violated Indian standards, it may have to recall vehicles, pay a penalty or even face criminal proceedings, Sharma said.

75,"China is showing its support for Russian President Vladimir Putin's initiative to develop the country's Far East. The support comes amidst tensions between Western countries and Russia. According to Reuters, China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, expressed support for Putin's plan during a press conference on Wednesday. Lijian said that China is confident that the Far East Development Program will bring positive results. Putin's plan, announced in 2013, aims to boost the economy of the remote region by tapping its vast natural resources and attracting foreign investment. The program includes the development of transportation infrastructure, the creation of a special economic zone, and the establishment of free ports. The program has faced delays, but Putin has pledged to continue pushing forward with it. China's support could help accelerate the program's progress. China is already a major player in the Far East's economy. The country is Russia's largest trade partner, and has invested heavily in the region's energy sector. In recent years, China has also shown interest in other key industries, such as agriculture and tourism. The two countries have also collaborated on several major infrastructure projects in the region, such as the Amur gas pipeline and the Boguchany hydroelectric plant. The support from China comes at a time when Russia is facing increased isolation from the West. The United States and the European Union have imposed economic sanctions on Russia over its actions in Ukraine and other issues. Russia's relations with NATO have also been strained. In response, Russia has turned to China for economic and political support. The two countries have deepened their cooperation in recent years, signing major trade deals and increasing military ties. The support from China could also help Russia counterbalance the growing influence of the United States and its allies in the region. The US has been increasing its presence in the Asia-Pacific, particularly in the maritime domain. The development of the Far East could also benefit China in the long run. The region's proximity to China makes it a potentially important hub for trade and transportation. The development of transportation infrastructure in the region could also improve China's access to Russian resources. Overall, China's support for Putin's plan is a positive development for Russia, which is seeking to diversify its economy and reduce its reliance on Western markets. The two countries' cooperation could also help balance the influence of the United States in the region.","Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping (not in picture) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, September 3, 2015. REUTERS/Parker Song/Pool By Katya Golubkova VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (Reuters) - Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang said on Saturday that Russia's push to revamp its run-down Far East region coincided with Beijing's strategy, backing President Vladimir Putin's drive for new sources of growth. At the Eastern Economic Forum in the Pacific Port of Vladivostok on Friday, Putin promised favourable business conditions and state support to Asian and domestic investors willing to come to Russia's most remote land. ""The Far East development strategy coincides with China's strategy of north-east rebirth,"" Wang said. ""(The) Russia-Chinese partnership will definitely bring generous fruits."" But for Putin's campaign to attract Asian funds to Russia, timing may be his worst enemy: the slowdown in the Chinese economy poses risks. Putin's turn to Asia comes at a time when relations with the West have hit their lowest since the Cold War, following Moscow's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. Russia needs money badly - sanctions and falling oil prices have hit the economy hard, with gross domestic product expected to fall 3.3 percent this year after growing 0.6 percent in 2014. China's growth, meanwhile, is slowing and its stock market falling, forcing Beijing into rate cuts and a yuan devaluation to buttress the economy. Ian Ivory, a partner at Golstblat BLP, said the Chinese slowdown will hardest affect emerging markets which are providers of raw materials. ""Russia is another classic example that will feel the pain, and China will be a further negative drag on the Russian economy,"" Ivory said in e-mailed comments. Andrey Kuzyayev, a former head of overseas operations at Lukoil, Russia's No.2 oil producer, played down the worries, saying the development of the Far East was not a temporary whim, but a long-term goal for the country. ""We need to make up time we have lost,"" he said. ""Cycles in any economy are the norm, not deviation. There will be a slowdown but obviously there will be acceleration later."" Chinese government's growth target is 7 percent this year, down from 7.4 percent in 2014 and the slowest in a quarter of a century. Wang's address to the forum on Saturday was short and he left immediately afterwards, in the middle of the session, followed by Chinese officials, including Wang Yilin, chairman of the board at China National Petroleum Corporation. ""This was unexpected but this was okay, we managed,"" said Boris Titov, chairman of the Russian part of the China-Russia Friendship Committee for Peace and Development. ""The first session was delayed and they (the Chinese delegation) had already a briefing scheduled."" A CNPC official, who was accompanying Yilin but declined to give his name, said only: ""The schedule has changed.""

76,"In an historic address to a joint session of Congress on Thursday, Pope Francis called on lawmakers to work together for the common good and address some of the world's most pressing issues, from climate change to poverty, while also calling for greater compassion for immigrants and refugees. ""I am convinced that we can make a difference,"" the pontiff told the assembled members of the House and Senate in his first-ever visit to the United States. ""I am convinced that we can build a better future for ourselves and for generations to come."" The pope's speech, which was delivered in English and Spanish, touched on a range of topics that have marked his papacy, including the environment, social justice, income inequality, and the rights of the poor and marginalized. He began by praising the efforts of legislators to promote the common good, but also urged them to go further in addressing core issues that affect all of humanity. ""Our world is facing a refugee crisis of a magnitude not seen since the Second World War,"" he said. ""This presents us with great challenges and many hard decisions. On this continent, too, thousands of persons are led to travel north in search of a better life for themselves and their loved ones, in search of greater opportunities."" The pope's call for greater compassion for immigrants and refugees comes at a time when the United States and other nations are grappling with a surge of migrants fleeing war and persecution in Syria and other conflict zones. He also highlighted the importance of caring for the environment, an issue that has been central to his papacy. The pope praised those who ""strive to protect and defend life"" and called on lawmakers to take ""courageous actions"" to address climate change. ""Our common home has been part of this group of the excluded which cries out to heaven and which today powerfully strikes our homes, our cities and our societies,"" he said. ""To use a telling phrase of the Reverend Martin Luther King, we can say that we have defaulted on a promissory note and now is the time to honor it."" Pope Francis was frequently interrupted by applause during his address, which lasted nearly an hour. He spoke in a soft, measured tone, often emphasizing the need for humility and cooperation in achieving shared goals. ""I urge you to build bridges and to break down barriers,"" he said. ""We must strive to provide all people with dignity, justice, and hope."" The pope's message of compassion and reconciliation marked a clear departure from the divisive rhetoric that has characterized much of the presidential campaign in the United States. ""He's calling us to challenge our usual ways of thinking and acting,"" said Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican moderate. ""He's asking us, each and every one of us, to be more compassionate and forgiving, to strive for unity, and to recognize the dignity and value of every person."" Some lawmakers expressed disappointment that the pope did not offer more explicit guidance on issues such as gay marriage and abortion, but many others praised him for his broader vision of social justice and human rights. ""He's challenging us to think beyond the short term, and to really work for a better future for everyone,"" said Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a Democrat and civil rights leader. ""That's a message that we all need to hear right now."" The pope's address was the latest in a series of high-profile appearances during his visit to the United States, which has also included stops in New York and Philadelphia. During his trip, he has sought to promote his vision of a more compassionate and inclusive society, while also challenging the church and its members to be more responsive to the needs of the poor and marginalized.

""If there are any of you that do not believe or cannot pray, I want you to send good wishes my way,"" he added. ""God Bless America!""

Ahead of the address, Francis met with House Speaker John Boehner, who has dismissed concerns that the pope's visit will stir political controversy. ""The pope transcends all of this,"" Boehner said. ""He appeals to our better angels and brings us back to our daily obligations. The best thing we can all do is listen, open our hearts to his message and reflect on his example."" Attending are some 500 lawmakers and officials. Four Supreme Court justices, including three of the six Catholics on the bench, will be present — Chief Justice John Roberts, as well as justices Anthony Kennedy and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is Jewish, will also attend. As The New York Times writes: ""In his first visit to the United States, Francis, 78, seemed eager to pass over his previous criticisms of a materialistic, capitalist culture and instead reach out to the world's most powerful nation. He praised the country's devotion to freedom of liberty and religion even as he cautioned that its vast resources demanded a deep sense of moral responsibility. ""God bless America,"" he said at the White House."" NPR's Tamara Keith notes that Francis will be speaking to a group of lawmakers who are much more Christian than the rest of the nation. After his address, the pope is scheduled to visit St. Patrick in the City and Catholic Charities for the Archdiocese of Washington. He is expected to have lunch with the homeless being served by the charity's St. Maria's Meals program. In the afternoon, he will fly to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and attend vespers in the evening at St. Patrick's Cathedral. On Friday, he will address the United Nations General Assembly."
77,"The Victorian Government has announced additional support for struggling students across the state, as schools continue to deal with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Education Minister James Merlino revealed the $250 million package, aimed at providing extra resources for students who have fallen behind due to remote learning, during a press conference on Wednesday. Under the scheme, schools will be able to employ tutors, teachers and other support staff to help students catch up on lost learning. The funding will also be used to purchase new educational resources and technology, and provide additional training for teachers. ""We know that for many students, remote learning has been a real challenge,"" Merlino said. ""That's why we're putting in place this extra support, to help those who have fallen behind get back on track."" The package will be rolled out to schools over the coming weeks, with priority given to students in disadvantaged areas and those who have been most impacted by the pandemic. The announcement was welcomed by education groups, who have been calling for additional support for struggling students since the beginning of the pandemic. ""This funding is absolutely crucial in ensuring that every student has the opportunity to succeed, regardless of the challenges they've faced this year,"" said Australian Education Union Victorian Branch president Meredith Peace. The government has also urged parents and carers to work closely with schools, and to seek help if their child is struggling with remote learning.","Parents' occupations and education levels will determine how much money Victorian schools receive under a new government funding model. Currently, funding for disadvantaged schools is based on the occupation of parents but under a $747 million investment to lift the levels of reading, maths and science across the state, parents education will also be considered. Premier Daniel Andrews and Education Minister James Merlino announced the new model at Wellington Secondary College in Mulgrave on Monday. Ambitious targets will also be set to ensure students are prepared for life after school, including a 33 per cent increase in scientific literacy and halving the number of students who leave school before completing Year 12. ""More of the same will mean Victoria goes backwards,"" Mr Merlino said. ""Over the last decade our outcomes across the board have stalled so we have to do something different."" The money will be rolled out over four years but schools will begin to receive funding from 2016. The budgeted but previously unassigned funding will also include programs targeting kids who need extra help in class, training teachers on the new Victorian curriculum - which includes new mandatory subjects like digital coding and respectful relationships. Australian Education Union Victorian branch president Meredith Peace welcomed the new model. ""I think what is positive is that they're looking at the education of the whole child,"" she said. Opposition leader Matthew Guy said government is rebranding old funding and questioned the timing. ""There is an ongoing review of the education system being undertaken by Steve Bracks at the moment. I would hope that it is a serious one given the government is making major announcements before it is complete,"" he said. ""What state school parents want is real funding and real outcomes."""

However, we are starting to realize the devastating impact that our actions have on the environment, and it's time to make a change. The concept of sustainability is becoming more crucial than ever, and it's no longer a luxury but rather a necessity. Durban, which is famous for its beautiful beaches and lush green forest reserves, is leading the charge in this regard. Many initiatives have been put in place to ensure that nature is preserved for future generations. The city has implemented recycling programs, green energy solutions, and eco-tourism activities. The use of public transport and the implementation of bike lanes have also reduced the city's carbon footprint. These initiatives have gained the attention of other cities worldwide and have become a benchmark of how to live in harmony with nature. In conclusion, we must strive to live sustainably if we want to ensure a healthy planet for our future selves and generations to come.

81,"Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Colorado has announced a partnership with Script Adviser to provide its members with access to infectious disease specialists. The move is aimed at ensuring that members receive high-quality care and treatment in the face of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. According to a statement released by the insurer, the partnership with Script Adviser will allow members to speak directly with infectious disease specialists via telehealth consultations. This will facilitate timely and effective treatment for those who require it, regardless of their geographic location. ""We understand that dealing with a complex and rapidly-evolving public health crisis, such as COVID-19, can be stressful and difficult for our members,"" said Peter Salazar, president of Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Colorado. ""By partnering with Script Adviser, we can offer our members access to the specialized care they need, from the comfort of their own homes."" Infectious disease specialists play a critical role in the treatment of illnesses caused by infectious agents, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. They are trained to diagnose and manage a wide range of infectious diseases, including those that are particularly challenging to treat or that pose a significant public health threat. By working with Script Adviser, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Colorado is taking a proactive approach to addressing the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. The telehealth consultations offered through the partnership will allow members to receive timely and effective care, without having to leave their homes or risk exposure to the virus. ""Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for members to get the care they need during this difficult time,"" said Salazar. ""By partnering with Script Adviser, we're able to offer members access to some of the most qualified infectious disease specialists in the country, regardless of where they live.""

Script Adviser is a Denver-based infectious disease medical practice that delivers its services via the Internet to primary care physicians and other providers who need consultations on complex medical conditions such as post-operative infections, complicated urinary tract infections and pneumonia. For Coloradoans who live far from major medical centers, this means they can stay in their home communities rather than travel to a metro area to receive care. “Anthem’s partnership with Script Adviser allows primary care physicians to have immediate real-time video consultations on complex cases that will improve patients’ health and lower the cost of care,” said Dr. Elizabeth Kraft, senior clinical officer for Anthem in Colorado. “Anthem’s partnership with Script Adviser will help improve access to specialty care and medical outcomes for patients while keeping health care local – a valuable benefit for all involved.” Spanish Peaks Regional Health Center began using Script Adviser routinely at its hospital, nursing homes and clinics in Walsenburg earlier this year. ""Script Adviser is a great tool to connect our physicians, through video conferencing, to specialists around the country - allowing us to provide the best treatment available without ever moving the patient to another hospital,"" said Korine Paisley, marketing and public relations director for Spanish Peaks Regional Health Center. ""If needed, three-way video conferencing occurs between the patient, physician and specialist. We are excited to use this technology to provide cutting-edge and comprehensive treatment to our patients in the most convenient setting possible."" Anthem has not only contracted with Script Adviser but is also partnering with them to make sure that participating Enhanced Personal Health Care (EPHC) primary care physicians are aware of their services. EPHC is Anthem’s signature patient-centered care payment innovation program that supports participating providers as they change the way they deliver care and agree to be compensated based on keeping members as healthy as possible. “Anthem has taken this collaboration to the next level by working with its Enhanced Personal Health Care docs so they know that Script Adviser is in their toolbox to deliver the best possible care to patients,” said Jesson Prohaska, President and CEO of Script Adviser. “Together, we can achieve the Triple Aim of improving access and quality while lowering costs.” About Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Colorado Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield is the trade name of Rocky Mountain Hospital and Medical Service, Inc., an independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. ® ANTHEM is a registered trademark of Anthem Insurance Companies, Inc.

83,"The Hezbollah and the Syrian Army have successfully foiled an attack by the Nusra Front in Zabadani, Syria. The terrorist group launched the attack in an attempt to occupy the town, but the Lebanese resistance and their Syrian allies were able to repel the militants and restore security to the area. The operation was carried out by a joint force consisting of Syrian Army troops and Hezbollah fighters, who worked together to safeguard the town from the Nusra Front's onslaught. According to reports, the militants used a number of tactics in their bid to overtake the town, including car bombs and rocket fire. Despite the ferocity of the assault, the Hezbollah and Syrian troops were able to hold their ground and counterattack the Nusra Front, forcing them to retreat back to their bases. The resolute action by the resistance groups was made possible by their expertise in guerrilla warfare, which allowed them to operate effectively in mountainous terrain. The success of the operation was confirmed by a series of photos released by Al Manar TV, which displayed Hezbollah and Syrian soldiers celebrating their victory in Zabadani. The images also showed a number of the Nusra Front militants who had been captured or killed during the clashes. The triumph of the Hezbollah and Syrian forces in Zabadani is a crucial setback for the Nusra Front, which has been seeking to expand its influence in Syria. The resolute action of the resistance fighters has proven that the terrorist group's plans can be thwarted, with the use of force and strategic planning.","At least 20 militants of the Takfiri group in Syria, Nusra Front, were killed and 30 others were injured in a failed attack on the southwestern city of Zabadani on Thursday. Media Military sources told al-Manar how Hezbollah and the Syrian army thwarted the terrorists attack on the Syrian army military posts in al-Alali orchard and Moza castle in northwestern Zabadani. About 200 militants took part in the attack which was aimed at breaking the siege on their fellows in Zabadani, the Military Media sources told al-Manar. Al-Nusra commander Abu Malek Al-Talli personally ordered the attack, the sources added. The allied forces repelled the terrorists’ attack, setting off explosive devices as well as striking their gathering points, according to the sources. The clashes lasted for eight hours and caused the death of at least 20 of the Nusra terrorists and the injury of 30 others. The allied forces have been since July 4 engaged in the battle of Zabadani, the last city under the control of terrorists in the Qalamoun region on the Lebanese border. The ongoing battle is part of a wider operation launched by the Syrian forces and the resistance movement’s fighters on May 4, which has reportedly driven militants out of more than 90 percent of the territory in the mountainous region."

85,"Red Bull Racing has once again threatened to quit Formula One at the end of the current season, according to statements made by team principal Christian Horner on Thursday. The announcement comes in light of the ongoing controversy surrounding the sport's move to new engine regulations starting next year. Speaking to reporters ahead of this weekend's Italian Grand Prix, Horner expressed his frustration with the current state of affairs. ""The new engine regulations just don't make sense for us as a team,"" he said. ""We can't justify the significant costs associated with the new engines, especially when they don't align with our long-term objectives."" The new engine regulations, set to come into effect from 2025, have been a point of contention in the sport for some time. The shift to more environmentally friendly hybrid power units has come under fire from many teams, with concerns raised about the added complexity and expense of the new technology. Red Bull in particular has been vocal about their opposition to the new regulations, citing concerns over cost, performance, and reliability. The team has been threatening to quit the sport for several months now, with Horner stating back in May that they were ""seriously considering"" leaving Formula One if the new regulations were not changed. Red Bull's parent company, Austrian energy drink giant Red Bull GmbH, has also expressed its disapproval of the new engine rules, with CEO Dietrich Mateschitz saying that they are ""killing the sport"". However, Horner's latest comments suggest that the team's position is becoming increasingly more definitive. ""We're not satisfied with the current situation, and we've made that clear to the powers that be. We'll continue to have discussions with them, but ultimately, we have to do what's best for our team,"" he stated. A potential departure by Red Bull would be a major blow to Formula One, with the team having enjoyed significant success in the sport since making their debut in 2005. They have won four constructors' championships and have been a constant presence at the front of the grid, thanks in large part to the driving talents of four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel and current star Max Verstappen. The team's exit would also leave the sport with just three engine manufacturers - Mercedes, Ferrari, and Renault - and would raise questions about the viability of the new regulations. However, some have argued that a shake-up of the current grid could be beneficial for the sport, spurring innovation and increased competition. As it stands, there is no clear indication as to whether Red Bull will follow through on their threat to leave Formula One. However, with the team's continued opposition to the new engine regulations, it seems increasingly likely that the sport may be facing a major shake-up in the coming years.","Red Bull has reiterated its threat to quit Formula One at the end of the season if it is not provided with a competitive engine. The team, based out of Milton Keynes, are in discussions with Ferrari over a deal to use their power units in 2016. Red Bull has reiterated its threat to end their ties with the sport But Red Bull, who won four consecutive driver and team championships between 2010 and 2013, will only remain on the grid if the Italian team supply an engine on par with those used by Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen. Toro Rosso, Red Bull's junior team, also face extinction from the sport. Team principal Christian Horner told Press Association Sport in Singapore that the threat of Red Bull withdrawing from Formula One should not be ""underestimated"". Renault, Red Bull's current engine supplier, are set to end their fractious relationship with the team at the end of the season. An article, published in Red Bull's media title Speedweek, reads: ""For those among us who have listened closely to what Red Bull chief Dietrich Mateschitz and his motor sports consultant Dr. Helmut Marko said recently and who interpret it correctly and put together one and one, a clear scenario emerges: Red Bull Racing and Scuderia Toro Rosso will pull out of Formula One after the 2015 season. ""Red Bull doesn't want to have customer engines that have 30 to 40 bhp less and can be manipulated by the constructor in case of the customer team endangering the works team. ""Red Bull would like to continue in F1 only if Ferrari is willing to provide true works engines that are on the same level as the engines of Vettel and Raikkonen."" Mateschitz, the team's outspoken Austrian owner, who is quoted in the same article, added: ""As a customer team you will only get an engine that is good enough to take away points from their immediate rivals. ""But this engine will never be good enough to beat the works team. With such a customer engine we will never be world champion again. And if that's the case we lose interest."" Red Bull had been in talks with Mercedes over using their power units next season. But the Silver Arrows, who boast the most competitive engine in the sport, withdrew from negotiations a fortnight ago. On Thursday, Toto Wolff, Mercedes motorsport boss, explained their decision. ""We decided with our board that we as an engine supplier - and as a team - have worked hard and long to achieve the success we have today, after taking the decision to enter the sport again as a works team in 2010,"" he told Formula1.com. ""Therefore we decided two weeks ago against exploring an engine supply to Red Bull. ""We wish to continue with our model to support independent, privateer racing teams - and to respect the relationships we already have in place with our customers - alongside our primary focus on the Mercedes works team.""

86,"Chinese President Xi Jinping has welcomed world leaders to Beijing for a ceremony commemorating the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. This event is expected to draw some of the world's most powerful leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, South Korean President Park Geun-Hye, and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The ceremony, which takes place on Thursday, will include a military parade and a silent march of troops. Xi Jinping is also expected to deliver a speech highlighting China’s role in ending the war and the country’s ongoing commitment to peaceful resolution of disputes in the region. However, the event has been met with controversy, as some world leaders have declined to attend due to concerns about China’s human rights record. The United States, Japan, and several European countries declined to send their leaders to the event, though officials from those countries will still attend. Overall, the event is a significant moment for China as it seeks to showcase its growing military might and global leadership.","Chinese President Xi Jinping received leaders of several nations and international guests for a military parade to commemorate China's victory over Japan in World War Two. Rough Cut (no reporter narration) ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan welcomed leaders of several nations and international guests on Wednesday (September 3) before a massive military parade to commemorate victory over Japan in World War Two, an event shunned by Western leaders but which underscores Beijing's growing confidence in its armed forces. Xi and Peng shook hands with the visiting World leaders and guests, including U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, South African President Jacob Zuma, South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the foot of Tiananmen Tower. Most Western leaders rebuffed invitations to attend, diplomats said, unhappy about the guest list and wary of the message China is sending to a region already rattled by its military assertiveness, especially in the South China Sea."

88,"Joyce Mitchell, the former prison seamstress who helped two convicted murderers escape from a high-security prison, is speaking out about her actions and the public perception of her. ""I'm not a monster,"" Mitchell told reporters during a recent interview. ""I made a mistake. I never meant for anyone to get hurt."" Mitchell, who worked at the Clinton Correctional Facility in upstate New York, was instrumental in the escape of inmates Richard Matt and David Sweat in June 2015. She provided the men with hacksaw blades, chisels and other tools, and even planned to drive them to Mexico before changing her mind. The escape led to a massive manhunt and a three-week search that involved thousands of law enforcement officials. Matt was killed by police during the search, and Sweat was shot and captured two days later. Mitchell was sentenced to up to seven years in prison for her role in the escape and is currently incarcerated at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in New York. During the interview, Mitchell expressed remorse for her actions and said that she is willing to accept the consequences of her choices. ""I understand why people are angry and upset,"" Mitchell said. ""I would be too if I were in their shoes. But I hope they can understand that I am not a bad person."" Mitchell acknowledged that her relationship with Matt and Sweat went beyond a professional capacity, but said that she never intended to help them escape. ""I was vulnerable and made some bad decisions,"" she said. ""But I never thought that things would get to the point they did."" Mitchell's interview comes on the heels of the release of a new Showtime docuseries on the escape, titled ""Escape at Dannemora."" Mitchell is portrayed in the series by actress Patricia Arquette. Mitchell said that she hopes the series will help shed light on her actions and show that she is more than just a criminal. ""I know that people will see the series and judge me based on what they see,"" she said. ""But I hope that they can also see that I'm a human being with feelings and emotions."" Mitchell's testimony in court was a critical factor in convicting Sweat and Matt's accomplice, corrections officer Gene Palmer, who was sentenced to six months in jail for his role in the escape. As for Mitchell's future, she said that she hopes to one day be released from prison and have a second chance at life. ""I know I messed up,"" she said. ""But I also know that I can do better and be better. I just hope that people can see that and give me a chance to prove myself.""","Ex-New York prison worker Joyce Mitchell (Photo: Pool) A New York prison seamstress who admitted aiding the brazen escape of two inmates from a maximum security prison in June says she ""flirted"" with one of the men but that there was never any love or consensual sex. ""There was never any actual sexual intercourse,"" Joyce Mitchell told NBC News' TODAY show in an interview aired Monday. ""Mr. Matt had grabbed me a couple times and kissed me. And then there was one point where he had, he wanted me to perform oral sex on him. And I said no. And when I said no, he grabbed my head and pushed me down."" Mitchell, 51, pleaded guilty in June to criminal facilitation and promoting prison contraband for aiding the escape of Richard Matt and David Sweat from the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, N.Y. She faces up to seven years in prison at sentencing Sept. 28. The escape June 6 touched off a massive three-week manhunt that ended with Matt, 48, being fatally shot by a law enforcement officer. Sweat, 34, was shot two days later, but survived and was returned to prison. Mitchell told to TODAY that she first became involved with the inmates at a time when she felt her husband didn't love her any more. ""I was going through a depression, and I guess they saw my weakness. And that's how it all started,"" she said. ""Their attention made me feel good."" Her first gifts were innocuous — brownies and other treats. Later she brought them a drill bit, saw blades and a metal punch. She said her bag was supposed to be checked when she went into the prison, but that it never was. Matt ""actually had told me at one point they had found a toolbox. And Mr. Sweat picked the lock and they found power tools in it,"" she said. But she said she continued aiding the men to protect her family. Matt planned to kill her husband Lyle, she said. Mitchell says she was supposed to drive the men to freedom after they escaped through a pipe that ran outside the prison walls, but she didn't go through with the plan. ""I am so sorry for everything that everyone went through because of me. I never, never wanted this to ever happen. Never. I would take it all back, if I could,"" she said. ""I'm not the monster that everybody thinks I am. I'm really not. I'm just somebody that got caught up in something that she couldn't get out of."" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1F9gtJT"

91,"San Francisco 49ers head coach, Jim Tomsula, has denied that Australian rugby star Jarryd Hayne has been assured a spot on the team's final roster. After impressing in preseason games, Hayne has become a fan favorite and generated excitement among 49ers supporters. However, Tomsula has made it clear that the team is still evaluating its options. ""We're evaluating the 53-man roster, we're evaluating the guys on the 90-man roster, so there's a work in progress everywhere,"" Tomsula said. ""I'm not talking about any one player, and I won't. The roster is a work in progress."" Hayne, who played rugby league for the National Rugby League's Parramatta Eels before signing with the 49ers in March, has been making the transition to American football as a running back and punt returner. Despite his impressive performances, Tomsula emphasized the need to take a cautious approach with the 27-year-old's development. ""We don't want to put a timeline on Jarryd, or any other player,"" he said. ""We're just trying to put the guys in the best position to showcase what they can do, and then we'll make evaluations based on practice and preseason games."" For now, it appears that Hayne will have to continue to earn his spot on the 49ers' roster like any other player.","Australian international Hayne has impressed the 49ers management during pre-season with a series of performances that have edged him closer to achieving his dream of a career in American football. However Tomsula insisted on Tuesday that Australian reports Hayne had already been guaranteed a place on the regular season roster -- which must be confirmed by Saturday -- were wide of the mark. ""I don't know what the rules are in the media in Australia, but you might want to fact check,"" Tomsula told San Francisco's KNBR radio station. ""The 53 is not set."" Hayne has already caught the eye with a series of runs during pre-season games against the Houston Texans, Dallas Cowboys and Denver Broncos, where he has been used mostly on special teams. He is due to play against the San Diego Chargers on Thursday in the 49ers' final warm-up before the season-opener against the Minnesota Vikings on September 14. Tomsula said he was looking for Hayne to develop his all round game in addition to his natural catching and running skills. ""I will say he's busting his tail in those other areas,"" Tomsula said. ""Guys, we didn't teach Jarryd Hayne how to catch that ball. OK? He came here with that ability. We knew that."""

95,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has strongly condemned the recent clashes that have erupted in Ukraine's capital Kiev over the issue of autonomy for the rebel-held east of the country. Speaking on the sidelines of a meeting with his Kyrgyz counterpart Sooronbay Jeenbekov, Putin described the situation as ""tragic"", and reiterated Moscow's position that negotiations were the only way to resolve the conflict. The clashes broke out on Saturday when a group of protesters, largely made up of far-right nationalist supporters, attempted to storm the parliament building in Kiev. The demonstrators were protesting against a proposed amendment to the Ukrainian constitution that would grant special status and greater autonomy to areas of the country controlled by Russian-backed separatist groups. Police used tear gas and smoke grenades to disperse the crowd, leading to clashes that lasted for several hours. The situation has escalated in recent weeks, with renewed fighting between Ukrainian forces and separatist militants in the east of the country. Moscow has accused Kiev of failing to implement the terms of a peace agreement brokered in 2015, which was intended to put an end to the conflict. Ukraine, meanwhile, has accused Russia of providing military support to the separatists, which Moscow denies. The issue of autonomy for the rebel-held east has been a major point of contention between Ukraine and Russia since the start of the conflict in 2014. Moscow has long insisted that the Russian-speaking population in eastern Ukraine should have greater autonomy, while Kiev has resisted this, arguing that it would lead to de facto partition of the country. The clashes in Kiev have raised fears of further violence and instability in Ukraine, which remains deeply divided over the issue of the conflict in the east. Negotiations between Ukrainian and Russian officials are ongoing, but there is no sign of a breakthrough in the near future.","Russian President Vladimir Putin. (Photo: AFP) Three National Guard members died in a grenade blast during the clashes Moscow : Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday condemned the deadly clashes that took place this week between police and nationalists in Kiev and questioned how long Ukrainians would ""put up with"" the instability rocking the country. In his first public comments on the unrest, Putin lamented the ""tragic events"" which unfolded outside Ukraine's parliament on Monday after a vote on granting more autonomy to regions, including two breakaway pro-Russian regions in the east. Three National Guard members died in a grenade blast during the clashes, which the government blamed on an ultra-nationalist group. Speaking at an international economic forum in Vladivostok, Putin was quoted by TASS state news agency as saying the violence constituted ""the next enactment of the political confrontation in Ukraine"", where the ouster of a pro-Russian president in 2014 brought a pro-Western government to power. Asked how he saw events in the former Soviet state unfolding, Putin said: ""This doesn't depend on us, this depends on Ukraine itself, on the Ukrainian people, how long the Ukrainian people will put up with this bacchanalia."" The constitutional reforms being debated by Kiev's parliament, which passed a first reading in parliament Monday, are part of a package of reforms required under a February peace deal between Ukraine and pro-Russian rebels in the east who took up arms against Kiev after the February 2014 ouster of Russian-backed then president Viktor Yanukovych. Putin said that it was ""crucial"" to give more powers to the separatist Donetsk and Lugansk regions. He also urged Ukraine to pass a law on amnesty for combattants."
96,"The recently released James Dean movie has left many fans disappointed, as it fails to capture the essence of the iconic Hollywood rebel. Life, directed by Anton Corbijn, has been criticized for being a cause without a rebel. The movie, which stars Dane DeHaan in the lead role, chronicles the life of the legendary actor, from his rise to fame to his untimely death. The film follows Dean's relationships with various people in his life, including photographer Dennis Stock, played by Robert Pattinson. While the film boasts a talented cast, it fails to delve into the complexity of Dean's persona. The movie offers little insight into what made the actor such a cultural icon in the 1950s and 60s. Instead, the film focuses on the mundane details of his life, such as his strained relationship with his father and the time he spent in New York City before making it big in Hollywood. The movie also lacks the sense of danger that was synonymous with the actor's persona. James Dean was known for his rebellious nature and his disregard for authority. He was the epitome of cool, a fact that is largely ignored in Life. Instead, the film shows a more vulnerable side of Dean, one that is at odds with the public's perception of him. One of the major criticisms of the film has been the performance of Dane DeHaan in the lead role. While the actor bears a striking resemblance to Dean, he fails to capture the intensity and charisma that made the actor a star. DeHaan's portrayal of Dean comes across as flat and one-dimensional, lacking the depth and nuance that the role requires. Another issue with the movie is its pacing. The film moves at a sluggish pace, with little happening on screen for long stretches of time. Life feels like a slog at times, with little to keep the audience engaged. While there are some positives to the film, such as the stunning cinematography and the strong supporting cast, these are not enough to make up for its shortcomings. Overall, Life is a film that fails to capture the essence of James Dean. It may be of interest to die-hard fans of the actor, but for everyone else, it is a cause without a rebel. In conclusion, Life is a disappointing movie that fails to capture the spirit of James Dean. While the film has some positive qualities, such as its stunning visuals and strong supporting cast, it ultimately falls short in its portrayal of the Hollywood icon. Fans of James Dean may find something to appreciate in the film, but for everyone else, it is a forgettable and uninspiring experience.","Dane DeHaan fails to capture the defiance of magnetic teen James Dean in the movie 'Life'. LIFE ★★½ stars 111 minutes, now showing. Director: Anton Corbijn Stars: Robert Pattinson, Dane DeHaan, Joel Edgerton Movie session timesFull movies coverage James Dean, who died at the end of this month 60 years ago, is a screen icon whose appeal has outlasted his small but influential body of work. His disaffected, charismatic stance has been appropriated far more often than the likes of 1955's Rebel Without a Cause and 1956's Giant are now appreciated. Any film about him must operate on multiple levels, demystifying parts of his life while affirming the cultural myths he posthumously came to embody. Life, written by the Australian novelist and screenwriter Luke Davies (Candy) and directed by the Dutch filmmaker Anton Corbijn​ (The American), makes their James Dean (Dane DeHaan​) the enigmatic quarry of struggling photographer Dennis Stock (Robert Pattinson). Based in Los Angeles, Stock pitches rising Hollywood star Dean as a subject for a pictorial essay to his photo agency editor, John Morris (Joel Edgerton), who in turn gets a commission from Life magazine. Richard Attenborough's Chaplin had a fine performance by Robert Downey jnr in the title role, but was felled by a vast, ineffectual scale, whereas Life is concentrated into a few weeks but lacks a convincing lead. DeHaan not only falls short in resembling Dean – he lacks the necessary leanness, while his overly high-pitched voice sometimes recalls Fozzie Bear from The Muppets – he also can't suggest the qualities that made him so magnetic on the screen. Corbijn saves Stock's now famous black-and-white photographs for the end credits, and thankfully doesn't attempt to recreate any of Dean's screen performances. ""Who is that guy?"" a voice whispers in wonder as Elia Kazan​'s East of Eden screens, but the camera stays on Stock as the enraptured viewer watching Dean's breakthrough performance, and the film can't answer the question. The dynamic between the two men concertinas between friendship and disdain, without coming into tight focus, and it's not helped by the lack of vitality from Corbijn, himself a celebrated photographer, compared to his previous feature, 2014's fine A Most Wanted Man. The film is best at catching the traditional social structure that would be swept away by Dean's creation of the teenager as a cultural and soon commercial force. The actor, already being coerced by his rapacious studio boss, Jack Warner (Ben Kingsley), is ambivalent about success, but Stock isn't, and insecurity and sour ambition seep out of Pattinson's performance as a hopeful young artist watching his subject duck opportunities. Pattinson, who has pushed himself into more demanding roles after his own teen idol phase in the Twilight franchise, is the best thing in this flawed, sometimes emotionally shapeless movie. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald."

99,"Switzerland has approved the extradition of Eugenio Figueredo, former Vice President of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), to face corruption charges in his native Uruguay. The Swiss Federal Office of Justice approved the extradition request from Uruguay on Wednesday, after Figueredo was arrested on suspicion of corruption in May 2015. The former FIFA executive, who holds both Uruguayan and Italian citizenship, has been accused of accepting bribes totaling millions of dollars in connection with the sale of marketing and broadcast rights for various soccer tournaments, including the Copa América. Figueredo, who is now 88 years old, has been fighting extradition to Uruguay since his arrest. He has claimed that he is too old and too ill to travel, and that he should be allowed to remain in Switzerland, where he has been living under house arrest since his arrest in 2015. However, the Swiss authorities have rejected Figueredo's arguments, stating that his health is not good enough to keep him from being extradited. In a statement released on Wednesday, the Swiss Federal Office of Justice said that ""despite his health problems,"" Figueredo ""is not in a life-threatening condition"" and that his extradition to Uruguay can proceed. The Uruguayan authorities have accused Figueredo of accepting bribes from several companies, including sports marketing company Full Play Group, in exchange for awarding them lucrative broadcasting rights for various soccer tournaments. The Uruguayan officials have also accused the former FIFA official of accepting bribes in connection with the sale of tickets for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. If Figueredo is convicted of the charges against him in his native Uruguay, he could face a long prison sentence. The Uruguayan authorities have been cracking down on corruption in recent years, and have made several high-profile arrests of former government officials and business leaders accused of bribery and other crimes. The case against Figueredo is just one of many that have been brought against FIFA officials in recent years as part of a wide-ranging investigation into corruption in world soccer. The investigation, which was led by US authorities, has resulted in the arrest of dozens of FIFA officials and sports marketing executives on charges of accepting bribes in connection with the sale of soccer broadcast rights. While the FIFA scandal has rocked the world of soccer, many officials have expressed hope that it will lead to meaningful reform of the sport's governing bodies. However, as long as corruption persists in soccer and other sports, there will likely be more cases like Figueredo's in the future.","The extradition of former FIFA vice-president Eugenio Figueredo to the United States to face corruption charges has been approved by Swiss authorities. The Uruguayan, a former president of the South American confederation CONMEBOL, was one of the seven officials from football's world governing body arrested at the request of US authorities in a dawn raid in Zurich on May 27 in the build-up to this year's FIFA Congress. Figueredo is accused of receiving bribes worth millions of dollars from a Uruguayan sports marketing company in connection with the sale of marketing rights to the Copa America tournaments in 2015, 2016, 2019 and 2023. Figueredo is also alleged to have acquired US citizenship fraudulently by submitting forged medical reports in 2005 and 2006. A statement from the Swiss Federal Office of Justice (FOJ), which approved the extradition, confirmed Figueredo had 30 days to appeal against the ruling to the Swiss Federal Criminal Court. Another of those arrested in Zurich on May 27 - Jeffrey Webb, a former president of the CONCACAF confederation representing North American, Central American and Caribbean countries - has already been extradited to the US. The US and Swiss attorneys general staged a news conference on Monday updating on their separate inquiries into allegations of corruption at FIFA. Promoted stories Michael Lauber, the Swiss justice chief, confirmed his country's authorities are investigating a World Cup television rights contract signed off by FIFA president Sepp Blatter that was sold to former FIFA official Jack Warner for a fraction of their true value. Lauber said that FIFA had sent prosecutors its explanation for the contract sold to the Warner-controlled Caribbean Football Union (CFU) for 600,000 US dollars (£389,000) - Warner's company later sold them on for an £11million profit. Meanwhile, the US attorney general Loretta Lynch announced fresh arrests and charges are likely as a result of the separate FBI investigations into the FIFA corruption scandal. Lynch, speaking at the same news conference as Lauber, said new charges and arrests against ''individuals and entities'' were anticipated. Lauber also revealed that assets including flats in the Swiss Alps and western Switzerland had been seized by his investigators, on suspicion of being used for money-laundering purposes, and that 121 different bank accounts have been brought to the attention of the investigating task force. In May, the US justice department announced indictments against 18 people on football-related corruption charges - four have pleaded guilty to charges. Lynch told the news conference on Monday: ""Separate and apart from the pending indictment our investigation has expanded since May. The scope of our investigation is not limited and is following the evidence where it leads. Share article ""We do anticipate pursuing additional charges against individuals and entities."" Asked if Blatter was under investigation or if it might interfere with his travel plans - the FIFA president did not travel to the women's World Cup in Canada in June following the arrests in May - Lynch added: ""I'm not going to comment on individuals and I am not able to give you information about Mr Blatter's travel plans."""
100,"The National President of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Ayuba Wabba, recently met with the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, to discuss the issue of unpaid salaries of workers in some federal agencies. At the meeting, which was held in Abuja, Wabba raised concerns over the non-payment of salaries of workers in some federal agencies, despite the fact that the Federal Government had released funds to pay their salaries. According to Wabba, the non-payment of salaries was affecting the livelihoods of workers and their families, and was also a breach of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Federal Government and the NLC. Responding to Wabba's concerns, Aregbesola assured the NLC President that the Federal Government was doing everything within its power to ensure that the salaries of all workers were paid on time. He also stated that the issue of unpaid salaries was not unique to federal agencies, as some state governments had also failed to pay their workers' salaries. Aregbesola emphasized the need for all employers to prioritize the payment of salaries, as it was the right of workers to receive their wages for the work they had done. He called on the NLC to continue to engage with the relevant authorities to find a lasting solution to the issue of unpaid salaries. The meeting between Wabba and Aregbesola comes at a time when workers in some federal agencies have been protesting over the non-payment of salaries. The NLC had earlier threatened to embark on a nationwide strike if the issue of unpaid salaries was not addressed by the Federal Government. It is hoped that the meeting between Wabba and Aregbesola will help to address the issue of unpaid salaries of workers in federal agencies, and prevent the NLC from embarking on a nationwide strike. In conclusion, the issue of unpaid salaries is a major concern for workers in Nigeria, and it is important for the Federal Government and all employers to prioritize the payment of salaries to workers. The NLC must continue to engage with the relevant authorities to ensure that the rights of workers are protected.","- The National President of the Nigeria Labour Congress, (NLC) Mr. Ayuba Wabba, on Monday held a meeting with Osun State Governor, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, on the crisis fuelling between the workers and the state government over their unpaid salaries. Wabba led labour leaders in the state to a meeting with the governor at the Governor’s Office in Osogbo. Journalists were barred from covering the meeting which lasted for about five hours. The NLC president, who briefed journalists after the meeting, said the two parties agreed that the bailout would be used to pay workers salaries and pensions. Wabba said, “We agreed that the bailout would be deployed to pay the outstanding salaries and pensions. It was agreed that the salaries would be paid in the next few days.” The governor in his statement made available to our correspondent by his media aide, Mr. Semiu Okanlawon also assured the workers that the bailout would be used to pay their salaries and pensions. The statement read, “We are using the opportunity to assure the entire workers in the state that all arrears of salary and pensions will be paid from the bailout funds as the reason for which it was received. And this is why the government has ensured that the verification exercise is concluded and the actual figure of workers is determined for the purpose of payment. “It is therefore important for workers themselves to ensure effective conclusion of this process in order to ensure they reap the fruits of their labour and prevent the criminal and dubious activities of those who reap where they do not sow. “Therefore, we must agree that civil service reforms are absolutely critical at this stage in the life of our dear state. There is a need for the engagement of all critical segments of leadership of government and labour for the necessary actions that will make the service effective, efficient and economic. “If our state, and by all means, the entire South-West region, will become financially and materially viable, a wholesome review of what works and what does not must be carried out and implemented with considerable alacrity and efficiency.”"

102,"Residents in the small town of Big Lobster are growing increasingly concerned about the state of their beloved landmark. The gigantic crustacean statue, which has become a popular cultural icon and tourist attraction, is deteriorating and in desperate need of repair. The Big Lobster, which was unveiled in 1979, stands at an impressive 18 meters tall and has wowed visitors for decades. But now, the famous statue is starting to show its age, with peeling paint, cracks and rust becoming more and more prominent. Locals fear that if the Big Lobster is not given a much-needed makeover, it will soon become an eyesore and may even be taken down altogether. In response to these concerns, a group of concerned citizens has started a petition calling on the government to fund the restoration of the Big Lobster. The group argues that the statue is an integral part of the town's identity and a significant source of income for the local economy. ""It's time for our government to step up and help us save our Big Lobster,"" said local resident, Mary Johnson. ""We don't want to see this iconic statue go to pot. It's time to give it the care and attention it deserves."" The fate of the Big Lobster now rests in the hands of government officials who will need to decide whether the statue is worth investing in. For the sake of the town's residents and visitors, let's hope they agree that it is.","Big Lobster Larry, who is 17m high, has definitely seen better days. Source: News Limited SOUTH Australia’s dangerous and dilapidated Big Lobster will have to be torn down unless his owners can raise tens of thousands of dollars for urgent repairs. After more than 35 years in Kingston, in the state’s southeast, 17m-high Larry has a partially-detached leg that swings in the wind, co-owner Frances Curkpatrick says. “He’s very badly deteriorated. He’s getting to the danger stage,” she said. “If he doesn’t get the work done, he has to come down and I don’t want to do that ... the people of Kingston love Larry.” Mrs Curkpatrick last week started an online campaign to raise $30,000 for repairs by Christmas and said she had received more than $700 in 24 hours. “You can just put your finger on his exterior and basically push through to the foam,” she said of Larry’s condition. “People come down this way to see him and it’s really embarrassing because he’s in a really bad condition.” Larry is located on the grounds of the Humbugz Honey restaurant, which Mrs Curkpatrick runs, at Kingston and has been a tourist drawcard in SA’s southeast."

105,"The former Bishop of Lewes, Peter Ball, has pleaded guilty to sexually abusing 18 young men over the course of several decades. The disgraced clergyman, who is now 87, entered his guilty plea at the Old Bailey on Monday. The court heard that Ball used his position of authority to groom and manipulate his victims, who were mostly young and vulnerable men trying to find their way in life. Ball's offences date back to the 1970s, when he was a teacher and youth worker in Sussex. He later served as a bishop in the Church of England, but resigned in 1993 after admitting to one charge of gross indecency with a teenage boy. He was given a police caution and continued to work as a priest until 2010, when fresh allegations of abuse came to light. The resulting investigation led to Ball's arrest in 2015, and a trial in 2016, in which he was convicted of sexually abusing 18 young men and sentenced to 32 months in prison. However, his sentence was cut to 16 months on appeal, and he was released in 2017 after serving just over a year. This week's hearing at the Old Bailey was called to deal with outstanding charges against Ball, and to hear his guilty plea. The court heard that Ball had used his position of authority to manipulate and abuse his victims, many of whom he had identified as vulnerable and in need of protection. Prosecutor John Price QC told the court: ""His position as a bishop gave him the opportunity to manipulate the victims both emotionally and spiritually. He used those positions to identify and groom the most vulnerable victims and to secure their trust and dependence."" Price said that Ball had used his ""charm and charisma"" to control his victims and make them submit to his sexual desires. The court heard that Ball had used his position of authority to gain access to young men who were struggling with their sexuality, and had offered them ""spiritual guidance"" and ""comfort"". The prosecutor described some of the abuse as ""deeply disturbing"", and said that Ball had left his victims with ""lifelong scars"". In a statement after the hearing, one of Ball's victims said: ""He stole my childhood, my innocence and my trust. His abuse has had a lifelong impact on me and my family."" Another victim, who chose to remain anonymous, said: ""I have waited for this day for many years and I am relieved that I can finally see justice being served."" In a statement, the Church of England said that it was ""appalled and ashamed"" by Ball's actions, and said that it would continue to support his victims. The church has launched an independent review into the handling of the allegations against Ball, and has apologised for its failure to take action earlier. Ball is due to be sentenced on 8 March, and could face a substantial term of imprisonment. His admission of guilt has been welcomed by his victims, who say that they finally feel that they have been heard and believed. However, they also say that their journey to healing and recovery will be a long and difficult one, and that they hope their experiences will help to bring about change in the church and wider society.","An ex-bishop who abused 18 young men and aspiring priests over 30 years has finally admitted his guilt after a last-ditch effort to throw his case out on the word of a former Archbishop of Canterbury failed. Former Bishop of Lewes Peter Ball, 83, used religion as a ""cloak"" to manipulate his victims, many of whom were in their teens, after they came to his home to explore their spirituality. In 1993, he accepted a caution in relation to one young man and resigned his post, believing the matter was closed despite police being aware of two more complaints. But in 2012, prompted by a Church of England review, Sussex Police reopened the case and last year charged him with a string of sex offences against teenage boys and young men who had gone to his former home in Litlington, East Sussex. Earlier this year, Mr Justice Sweeney refused to dismiss the case on a legal technicality after it emerged Ball and former archbishop Lord Carey had been assured in 1993 that there would be no future action once he accepted the caution. Today, weeks before his trial was due to start at the Old Bailey, Ball, who has suffered ill health but was deemed fit to stand trial, pleaded guilty to misconduct in a public office. The charge stated that between 1977 and 1992 he misused his position in authority ""to manipulate and prevail upon others for his own sexual gratification"" in relation to 16 young men. He also admitted two counts of indecent assault on two separate young men in their late teens at his East Sussex home between 1980 and 1983 and between 1990 and 1991. Two other counts of indecent assault on a boy of 12 or 13 and a 15-year-old youth were denied and will lie on file. Afterwards, Detective Chief Inspector Carwyn Hughes of Sussex Police said 12 of the victims had come forward since the investigation was launched. He said: ""It became clear that under the guise of his status as a Bishop, Ball had systematically abused the trust of the victims, many of whom who were aspiring priests, whilst others were simply seeking to explore their spirituality. ""He abused that trust and used religion, through his Give A Year For Christ scheme, as a cloak behind which to carry out his grooming activity, the principal aim of which was to satisfy his sexual interest in and desire for young men. ""We put tremendous effort into thoroughly and diligently investigating these allegations over several years, where necessary even sending officers abroad to interview witnesses and victims."" Details of the long history leading to the former clergyman being reinvestigated can only be reported today after restrictions were lifted by Mr Justice Wilkie. In 1993, the Church of England avoided scandal when Ball, by then Bishop of Gloucester, accepted a caution for a single historic allegation of gross indecency and resigned, despite Gloucester Police being aware of allegations by two more men. On March 5 that year, his lawyer received a letter from the Crown Prosecution Service which the defence said related to all allegations against Ball. It stated: ""The view is taken that there is sufficient admissible, substantial and reliable evidence available to support prosecuting your client for offences of indecent assault and gross indecency. ""Having regards to all the circumstances, however, the Crown would be prepared to allow disposal less than prosecution - namely a caution for an offence of gross indecency with (a 19-year-old man) as an alternative to prosecution."" Richard Smith QC, suggested the CPS may have settled on the caution to avoid the publicity of a bishop in the dock after discussion ""behind closed doors"" and not because there was no realistic prospect of conviction. Giving evidence at that hearing, Ball insisted that the police officer who cautioned him had clearly told him that was the end of it. He recalled: ""After I took the caution I asked very clearly 'Does this include all other offences of the same nature?' before the taking of the caution and I was told very clearly that it did. ""I can remember so clearly I was so glad to get away - to get a guarantee that it was all over. ""That was the last words of the police officer - 'Bishop, it's all over'. ""I was so pleased I went like a rocket down to Cornwall to my brother."" Lord Carey, who was Archbishop of Canterbury at the time, appeared to back up his claim in his recollections of the incident which were read out in court. On hearing the news of Ball's caution, he wrote: ""I was troubled. I did not think this was good enough. I wanted some form of assurance. ""All we had was the resignation of Bishop Peter. ""I was worried that if any other allegations of past indecency were made it would reignite. I wanted some reassurance that this would not be the case. ""I was so troubled, that evening after dinner I went to my study. ""I was supplied with a number of a man at the CPS I believed to be a director. I do not recall his name. ""I rang him and asked what might happen if allegations from the past were made. ""I was told quite categorically that the other allegations would not be taken further as far as we are concerned. ""He has resigned. He is out of it. The matter is closed. We are not going to take anything any further."" The defendant also claimed that a promise to resign from his post was a condition of the police caution, even though he later explored the possibility of being allowed back to work. Cambridge-educated Ball, who now lives in Langport, Somerset, appeared frail and falteringly entered his pleas via video link from Taunton Crown Court. Mr Justice Wilkie remanded him on bail to await sentencing on October 7. Ball was Bishop of Lewes between 1977 and 1992 and Bishop of Gloucester from 1992 until his resignation the following year. He was said to have many high-profile friends and acquaintances, including the Prince of Wales. Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved."
106,"During a recent address by Pope Francis to a joint session of Congress, one speaker was visibly moved by the message of the pontiff. Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a practicing Catholic, was seen wiping tears from his eyes as the pope spoke about the importance of compassion and working to serve the common good. Rubio, who has been a staunch critic of the Obama administration's policies, was seen listening attentively as Pope Francis spoke about issues such as poverty, immigration, and the environment. According to sources close to the senator, he was deeply touched by the pope's words and felt a great sense of peace and hopefulness after his address. Many analysts have pointed out that Rubio's emotional response to the pope's address could be seen as a sign of the growing influence of religion in American politics. As more and more politicians speak openly about their faith and how it affects their decision-making, there is a renewed focus on issues related to morality and values. In any case, Rubio's emotional display during the papal address was a powerful reminder of the profound impact that religious leaders can have on public figures, and how their words can inspire change and growth in both individuals and society as a whole.","(Before It's News) A devout Roman Catholic for the better part of his life, Senator Marco Rubio attended Pope Francis’s scheduled address to a joint session of the U.S. Congress this past Thursday, leaving many to believe that Rubio became emotional as Francis spoke about foreigners and immigrants. “We the people of this continent are not fearful of foreigners because most of us were once foreigners…”I say this to you as the son of immigrants, knowing that so many of you are also the descendants of immigrants.”- Pope Francis The one time pro-legal immigration hawk, Rubio softened his position on the issue in 2013, and cosponsored the highly unpopular Senate Gang of Eight immigration reform legislation. Rubio has since reversed himself, and now believes that the issue needs to be tackled in different steps, or a “piecemeal” approach. Rubio is an emotional guy, especially when discussing his father who passed away shortly before his historic 2010 Senate election win, or talking about immigrants, as both of his parents escaped communist Cuba and immigrated to the U.S. Rubio’s campaign was quick to exploit this moment by posting the C-SPAN clip to their Youtube page.

107,"As the leader of the Catholic Church, Pope Francis commands the attention of the world. From his views on social issues and politics to his daily routine, many are fascinated by his every move. In this article, we delve deep into the likes, dislikes, daily routine and favorite foods of Pope Francis. Likes: Pope Francis is known for his love of simplicity and humility. He reportedly chooses to wear simple white robes rather than the ornate costumes that his predecessors favored. He is also known for his love of football, which he played in his youth. He is an avid supporter of the Buenos Aires football club, San Lorenzo. In addition to football, he is passionate about opera, and loves listening to music by Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach. He also has a soft spot for literature and reading. Dislikes: Pope Francis is reportedly not a fan of consumerism and materialism. He is known for his calls to reduce excess consumption and for his advocacy for the poor and marginalized. He has also spoken out against the exploitation of the environment and has been a strong advocate for addressing climate change. The Pope is also not fond of the Vatican bureaucracy which he has criticized as being overly sclerotic. Daily routine: The Pope's daily routine is highly structured and rigorous. He usually wakes up at around 4:30 a.m., and begins his day by praying for an hour. After this, he exercises and takes a cold shower. He then celebrates Mass at around 7:00 a.m. The rest of his day is filled with meetings with Cardinals, Bishops and other dignitaries from around the world. In the afternoon he usually has a nap, before resuming his work in the evening. He often works late into the night, typically spending his evenings responding to correspondence or reading. Favorite foods: Pope Francis has been described as having a simple palate. He is known for enjoying traditional Argentinian dishes such as empanadas, milanesa, and dulce de leche. He also has a sweet tooth, and has been reported to indulge in chocolate and tiramisu on occasion. He has been known to enjoy a good pizza and reportedly once called up a local pizzeria to order a pizza for himself and his entourage. In conclusion, Pope Francis is a man of simplicity, compassion, and humility. Despite his high status in the church, he has always remained grounded and connected with the people he serves. His likes and dislikes reflect his values of frugality, compassion, and care for the environment. His daily routine is a testament to his disciplined and structured approach to work and spiritual practice. And his favorite foods highlight his love of simple, delicious meals that reflect his Argentinean heritage. It is no wonder that he is so beloved by Catholics and non-Catholics alike.","In this photo provided by the Vatican paper L'Osservatore Romano, Pope Francis meets Pope emeritus Benedict XVI in Castel Gandolfo Saturday, March 23, 2013. Pope Francis has traveled to Castel Gandolfo to have lunch with his predecessor Benedict XVI in a historic and potentially problematic melding of the papacies that has never before confronted the Catholic Church. The Vatican said the two popes embraced on the helipad. In the chapel where they prayed together, Benedict offered Francis the traditional kneeler used by the pope. Francis refused to take it alone, saying ""We're brothers,"" and the two prayed together on the same one. (AP Photo/Osservatore Romano, HO) Uncredited, AP Enlarge photo» VATICAN CITY — NAME: Jorge Mario Bergoglio. As of March 13, 2013, Pope Francis. DOB: Dec. 17, 1936 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Born the eldest of five children to Italian immigrants Mario Bergoglio, an accountant, and Regina Sivori, a homemaker. His youngest sister, Maria Elena Bergoglio, still lives in Buenos Aires. NAMESAKE: Francis is the first pope to name himself after St. Francis of Assisi. The 13th century monk was born to a wealthy cloth merchant but cast aside his worldly wealth and devoted himself to the poor and to rebuilding a church that had fallen into spiritual ruin. Francis of Assisi is also known for his love of nature, and Francis the pope named his most important document — his environment encyclical ""Praise Be"" — after Francis the monk's Canticle of Creation. DAILY ROUTINE: Francis rises on his own at around 4:30 a.m. and spends the next two hours praying, meditating on the Scripture readings for the day and preparing his morning homily. He delivers it off-the-cuff at the 7 a.m. Mass in the chapel of the Vatican's Santa Marta hotel where he lives. After Mass, Francis greets the faithful in the atrium outside the chapel, then walks a few meters into the hotel dining room for breakfast. He often will have fresh-squeezed orange juice (a papal indulgence since other diners are served only packaged OJ) and membrillo, a gelatinous paste made from quince that is popular in Argentina. After breakfast, Francis takes Elevator A up to the second floor to his home: Santa Marta's Room 201, though he has actually converted the entire second floor of the hotel wing into a home office. He then gets to work, either staying in the hotel or heading to the Apostolic Palace if he has formal audiences. Occasionally he takes a break to recite the rosary. After a 1 p.m. lunch in the dining room, Francis takes a siesta of about 40 minutes to an hour and resumes working into the evening, often taking care of correspondence. He tries to get in an hour of adoration before the Blessed Sacrament before dinner, though he confesses to sometimes falling asleep while praying. Dinner in the dining room is self-service, cafeteria-style at 8 p.m. and Francis has been known to microwave his own food if it's not warm enough. Before taking the elevator back upstairs, he will be sure to thank the Swiss Guard, Vatican gendarme and reception desk clerk on duty in the hotel lobby, and say good-night. He's in bed by 9 p.m., reads for an hour and is asleep — ""like a log"" — for the next six hours or so. VACATION ROUTINE: Unlike his predecessors, Francis has never used the papal summer retreat at Castel Gandolfo in the hills south of Rome, preferring to stay home and just lighten his schedule. During vacation, Francis says he wakes up later and does more reading for pleasure, listening to music and praying. HOBBIES: Francis is a lifelong fan of soccer and has kept his membership in his beloved San Lorenzo club (Member No. 88235N-0). But he doesn't watch it on TV — in fact he says he hasn't watched TV since 1990 when he made a promise to the Virgin of Carmen that he would abstain from then on since TV ""just wasn't for me."" For news, he reads the middle-brow Rome daily Il Messaggero. FAVORITE FOODS: Francis adores mate, the typical Argentine tea, and readily sips from mate gourds handed up to him from fans. He prefers meat over fish and has a sweet-tooth: Friends from home bring him alfajores, the Argentine cookies filled with dulce de leche and covered in chocolate. But visitors to the Santa Marta dining room say he's not a finicky eater and consumes pretty much anything he is served. He has said he misses going out for pizza and recalls fondly getting pizzas after watching San Lorenzo games at Buenos Aires' ""Gasometro"" stadium en famille."
108,"Florida Senator Marco Rubio recently announced a new plan to offer paid family leave to American workers. The proposal has been met with mixed reactions, with some praising it as a necessary step towards supporting working families, while others criticize it for failing to fully address the needs of all workers. But who really benefits from Rubio's paid leave plan? Under the proposal, workers would receive 12 weeks of paid leave to care for a new child or a sick family member. The program would be funded by allowing workers to draw on their Social Security benefits early in exchange for delaying retirement. While this approach may sound reasonable on the surface, critics argue that it could actually harm the very workers it aims to help. Firstly, the plan would largely benefit higher earning workers, as they have more to gain from being able to delay retirement and draw on their Social Security benefits later on. This means that lower-income workers, who are already struggling to make ends meet, may not be able to afford to take the leave they need. Additionally, the plan does nothing to address the fact that many workers, particularly those in low-wage jobs, do not have access to sick days or other types of leave. As such, these workers would not be able to take advantage of the program even if they were eligible. Furthermore, the proposal does not include any provision for caregiving for other family members, such as elderly parents or grandparents. This means that workers who need to take time off to care for an ill family member outside of the immediate household would not be covered under the plan. Critics also point out that the plan provides no job protection for workers who take leave. This means that an employee who takes time off could be at risk of losing their job, and their income, altogether. Despite these concerns, supporters of the plan argue that it is better than the current situation, where many American workers have no access to any kind of paid leave. But is this really the case? In countries where paid leave is mandatory, such as Sweden and Denmark, workers are entitled to up to a year of paid leave, with some of it being reserved for fathers. There is also no gender requirement, meaning that fathers are expected and encouraged to take time off to care for their newborn children. This allows both parents to deepen their bonds with their child and helps to distribute caregiving responsibilities more evenly between mothers and fathers. In contrast, Rubio's plan does little to shrink the gender gap in caregiving responsibilities. As it stands, women are much more likely to take time off to care for a new child or sick family member than men. Unless this situation changes, the burden of caregiving will continue to fall disproportionately on women, making it harder for them to advance in their careers and achieve financial security. In conclusion, while Marco Rubio's paid leave plan is a step in the right direction, it falls short of fully addressing the needs of American workers. Without any kind of job protection or support for lower-income workers, the plan may actually exacerbate existing inequalities and make it harder for workers to take time off when they need it most. To truly support working families, we need to look to countries like Sweden and Denmark, where paid leave is a fundamental right for all workers, regardless of income, gender, or job status.","The Values Voter Summit, an annual gathering of conservatives hosted by the anti-gay, anti-abortion Family Research Council, bills itself as an event dedicated to “traditional” values. This usually translates to fire and brimstone about same-sex marriage and reproductive freedom, but, on Friday, Marco Rubio veered off that script and talked about something unexpected from a current Republican presidential candidate: the importance of paid leave. “One of the greatest threats to family today is that too many Americans have to choose between being there for their children in times of great need, or meeting the basic financial needs of their families,” he said before pointing out that losing a paycheck to stay home with a new baby or sick relative is “simply not a viable financial option for many Americans.” He’s right. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , fewer than 15% of workers in the U.S. have access to any kind of paid family leave, and low-wage workers take the hardest hit when it comes to juggling family and work. According to the same data, just one in 20 workers in the bottom quartile can take time off without losing necessary income. Rubio’s plan would offer a 25% tax credit to employers who offer a minimum of 4 weeks of paid family leave. The maximum pay out per employee, to full-time and part-time workers, would be $4,000, and the maximum leave time would be 12 weeks. “For instance,” Rubio explained, “if you are offered $1,600 in paid leave for four weeks while you take care of your newborn, which would be the equivalent of about $10 an hour, your employer could claim a tax credit for $400.” Now here’s another essential part of the plan: it’s fully voluntary. Rubio doesn’t believe the government should require federal leave, and wants to leave it to the market to sort out. Problem is, the market has already tried, and failed, to sort this out. “We’ve already let the market have its say,” Teresa Boyer, executive director and assistant research professor at Rutgers University’s Center for Women and Work, told me over the weekend. “I’m concerned about how this will impact the workers who most need it,” she said. “Right now, the U.S. doesn’t require it by law, and neither does this proposal. It’s just an incentive. In the U.S., there are a number of workers who get paid family leave, but they get it through their employers, and they’re usually higher paid professional workers or workers at larger companies. So when I hear something like a tax credit, I think it’s really just going to provide further financial backing to these companies that have the deeper pockets in the first place.” Plus, there is already a market incentive to offer paid leave: it boosts productivity and helps companies attract and retain workers. That’s exactly why you have companies like Netflix rolling out deceptively lush unlimited leave plans for high-end salaried employees but leaving out the people who work in its DVD distribution centers. “A number of employers already offer it to their highly valued employees—it’s about employee retention,” Boyer explained. “So if you leave it up to the market, you’ll have a very similar situation to what we have now: paid family leave is offered to certain employees, but not to all. “And my focus as a researcher has always been that these sorts of work supports reach the low-income people who are working part-time job to part-time job, trying to make ends meet, but aren’t able to do that when they have to take leave,” she continued. “I’m thinking that a tax credit would not provide that kind of access. The types of employers that are there aren’t going to be as incentivized as those larger companies.” The other problem with Rubio’s plan: it isn’t portable. If you leave your job, something you’re more likely to do if you’re stitching together several part-time gigs, then you leave the benefit behind, too. “And think about the workers who are most at risk here, they do change jobs,” Boyer said. Ultimately, she summarized the plan this way: “It’s not going to harm anyone, but it’s not really going to help anyone, either.” But I’d add one note: the person Marco Rubio’s paid leave plan will help most is Marco Rubio. Paid leave is an immensely popular policy, with 80% of Americans coming out in favor of paid time off . Its surging popularity, and the increasingly dire situation millions of working families find themselves in, has pushed the issue into the political mainstream. Whereas paid leave was a political pipe dream this time last year, it’s become a centerpiece of the campaigns being run by Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Martin O’Malley. And the Republican presidential field’s uniform opposition to a federal paid leave policy, and its lack of alternative suggestions, puts it wildly out of step with a vast majority of voters. So Rubio, in taking what is essentially a no-risk position to incentivize paid leave for companies that are already offering it or flirting with the idea of offering it, gets to distinguish himself as the Republican contender who says he values families and means it. At a moment when the GOP has come to define itself by Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant vitriol and Ted Cruz’s looming threats of a shutdown, Rubio is positioning himself as the even-handed grownup in the room, and that may appeal to establishment Republicans who are kind of freaking out about their party’s presidential prospects . Rubio’s paid leave proposal could be a big boost for Rubio, but the 26 million private sector workers who don’t have access to any paid time off will need more than a bit of slick campaigning to make ends meet. If they’re looking for a policy that will make that juggling act more manageable, they’ll have to look elsewhere."

The fourth-seeded Dane, last year's runner-up, beat NCAA champion Jamie Loeb 6-2, 6-0 in 67 minutes Tuesday in the first round, never in danger of becoming another upset victim on the women's side. The 20-year-old Loeb earned a wild card into the draw by winning the college title as a sophomore at North Carolina. She made her Grand Slam debut after recently turning pro. After Wozniacki's win, seeded women were just 12-9 so far. Add in Maria Sharapova's withdrawal, and 10 of the 32 seeds are already out before the second round. Just four seeded women's players lost in the first round last year. Since the tournament started seeding 32 players in 2000, the largest number of women's seeds to lose in the opening round was 10 in 2012. Sixth-seeded Lucie Safarova, who was upset earlier Tuesday, said she was bothered by a strained abdominal muscle on her right side that she hurt in losing the New Haven final Saturday. Safarova is pulling out of doubles, where she and American Bethanie Mattek-Sands would have been among the favorites after winning the Australian and French Opens this year. ___ 12:15 p.m. Half of the top 10 seeds in the women's draw are already out of the U.S. Open.

The French Open runner-up had a tough first-round matchup against 37th-ranked Lesia Tsurenko and lost 6-4, 6-1 in just 65 minutes Tuesday. Seventh-seeded Ana Ivanovic, eighth-seeded Karolina Pliskova and 10th-seeded Carla Suarez Navarro were all eliminated Monday, a day after third-seeded Maria Sharapova withdrew because of a leg injury. Safarova had defeated Tsurenko in straight sets in New Haven just four days earlier. She went on to lose a three-setter to Petra Kvitova in the title match Saturday. Tsurenko had been playing well on the hard courts this summer to reach a career-best ranking this week. The 26-year-old from Ukraine upset Pliskova to make the New Haven semis, where she fell to Safarova. Before that, she upset Wimbledon runner-up Garbine Muguruza in advancing to the quarterfinals in Toronto. The U.S. Open is the only major tournament at which Safarova has never reached the quarterfinals. The Czech lefty took Serena Williams to three sets in the French Open final.

112,"Victoria Beckham is under criticism from multiple fronts for using super-skinny models in her recent show at New York Fashion Week (NYFW). The creator of the British brand and former Spice Girl showcased her Spring/Summer 2022 collection in Manhattan earlier this week. As photographs from the show emerged on social media, some users expressed concern over the size of the models. Many commented that the clothes appeared to hang off their frames and that they look skinny even by the fashion industry's standards. Beckham has been widely criticized in the past for promoting an unrealistic body image and using underweight models in her shows and advertising campaigns. In 2018, the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) released guidelines to encourage the hiring of healthy models with a body mass index of at least 18.5. Despite these guidelines, the use of super-skinny models persists in the fashion industry. It's not clear whether any of the models in Beckham's show violated the CFDA guidelines, but the appearance of the models has raised eyebrows amongst many. This also comes at a time when there is an increased focus on body diversity and body positivity in fashion. Other designers such as Christian Siriano and Chromat have been applauded for featuring diverse models of all sizes in their shows. It remains to be seen how Beckham will respond to the criticism, but it's clear that this issue will continue to be a point of contention in the fashion industry.","Victoria Beckham has previously faced criticism for her super-skinny frame, but this time, it's not her figure that is coming under fire.

The 41-year-old mother of four shared a variety of behind-the-scenes images from her show, during which husband David Beckham and Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour were both seated in the front row, and is facing heavy backlash on social media for her choice in models.

113,"Volkswagen May Never Recover From This Mess It's been five years since the Volkswagen emissions scandal broke out, and the German car manufacturer is still reeling from the aftermath. The company was found to have cheated on emissions tests for diesel cars, using software that showed lower emissions during testing than on the road. The fallout from this scandal has cost Volkswagen billions of dollars in fines, settlements, and buybacks. But the damage to the company's reputation may be irreparable. The scandal first came to light in September 2015, when the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) accused Volkswagen of using ""defeat devices"" to cheat on emissions tests. Volkswagen initially denied the allegations, but eventually admitted to installing software in millions of diesel cars that could detect when they were being tested and adjust emissions accordingly. The software could turn off emissions controls, allowing the cars to spew up to 40 times the legal limit of nitrogen oxides during normal driving. The fallout was swift and severe. Volkswagen's stock price plummeted, and the company faced billions of dollars in fines and lawsuits. The scandal also damaged the reputation of diesel cars, which had long been marketed as a cleaner alternative to gasoline cars. Several countries, including Germany, the UK, and France, announced plans to phase out diesel cars altogether. The company's response to the scandal was also criticized. Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn resigned just days after the scandal broke, but the company was slow to take responsibility for the cheating. Instead, it tried to shift blame onto a few rogue engineers and executives. This only added to the public's perception that Volkswagen was not taking the scandal seriously. Since then, Volkswagen has been working to clean up its image and pay for the consequences of its actions. The company has paid over $30 billion in fines, settlements, and buybacks, and has invested heavily in electric cars to try to move beyond diesel. But despite these efforts, Volkswagen's reputation may never fully recover. One reason for this is the ongoing legal battles. While Volkswagen has settled many of the lawsuits against it, there are still several pending cases that could cost the company even more money. Just this year, the company agreed to pay $96.5 million to settle a lawsuit brought by states including California over emissions violations. The company's reputation has also been hurt by the slow pace of its electric car rollout. While Volkswagen has promised to invest $33 billion in electric cars by 2023, it has yet to deliver a mass-market electric car. This has allowed competitors like Tesla and Nissan to gain a foothold in the electric car market, while Volkswagen is still struggling to regain consumer trust. Another issue for Volkswagen is the changing landscape of the auto industry. The rise of ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft, as well as the development of autonomous cars, has made owning a car less important for many people. This could hurt Volkswagen's sales in the long run, as fewer people are interested in buying cars. The COVID-19 pandemic has also hit Volkswagen hard. Like many car manufacturers, the company has had to shut down factories and cut production to deal with the pandemic's effects. This has only added to the financial pressures on the company. All of these factors could spell trouble for Volkswagen in the long run. While the company has weathered the immediate fallout from the emissions scandal, its reputation may never fully recover. As the auto industry continues to change, Volkswagen will need to adapt to stay relevant. But whether it can fully recover from the damage wrought by the emissions scandal remains to be seen.","It took Volkswagen years to build its reputation in the United States as a hip, countercultural brand -- so cool that an ad for the company is used in an episode of "" Mad Men "" to signal the fast-changing advertising landscape. That carefully cultivated brand quickly lost its magic after the Environmental Protection Agency charged the automaker with purposefully designing software for Volkswagen diesel vehicles to skirt environmental regulations. On Wednesday, chief executive Martin Winterkorn announced he would step down from the company in the wake of the scandal . ""As CEO I accept responsibility for the irregularities that have been found in diesel engines,"" he said in a statement. ""Volkswagen needs a fresh start -- also in terms of personnel. I am clearing the way for this fresh start with my resignation."" Volkswagen’s brand perception plummeted into negative territory this week -- meaning more people are hearing bad things about the automaker than good things -- for the first time in six years , according to new data from market research firm YouGov's BrandIndex , which tracks consumers views on various companies. YouGov BrandIndex Though automakers have a long history of trying to skirt environmental regulations -- indeed, VW was fined in 1973 for installing cheat devices, notes The New York Times -- the large scale of the issue this time and the brazen failure of the company to live up to its environmentally savvy reputation could be devastating. ""If VW gets its reputation back, it will be clawing up the side of a very high mountain,"" said Thomas Donaldson, a professor of business ethics at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, referring to the scandal as a ""corporate Watergate."" When a company openly admits to the buying public -- a group it is trying to build trust with -- that it’s been cheating, that’s difficult to come back from. The costs to the company may far exceed the approximately $7 billion its set aside to pay for its mistake. So far, its stock price has plummeted. But the big issue is future sales. VW just this year surpassed Toyota as the world’s largest automaker by sales -- but this scandal is clearly going to cost them customers. “I’ll never entertain another Volkswagen again,” said Tom Farmer, who lives in the Seattle area and leases a diesel Jetta, in part, because of its environmental credentials. He’s counting down the months until his lease runs out, he told The Huffington Post, echoing a chorus of betrayed VW owners. Kevin Foster loved his 2013 Beetle, his first diesel, so much he named her Beatrice.“I believe in global warming and I thought I was doing my part to help succeeding generations,” Foster, an engineer who lives in northern Tennessee, told HuffPost. “And it has all been a lie.” It’s not clear if the automaker will ever recover its good name . A longtime company insider and the highest paid CEO in Germany, Winterkorn is known to be extremely attentive to details; his organization was run in a very top-down, centralized manner. Though we don’t know if he knew about the cheat devices; in the end it did not matter. “You may not have known about the iceberg, but you still need to be looking for it,” Donaldson said. VW CEO #Winterkorn says ""sorry"". Sorry, but his lame statement is not good enough. He has to resign. Now. #VWGate #Volkswagen — Christian Schumacher (@ChrisWeb1) September 23, 2015 Winterkorn dutifully delivered his apology the day before he stepped down. “I’m very sorry, I’m utterly sorry,” he said in a video statement, a stunning acknowledgement that the automaker had knowingly cheated its customers. The 68-year-old Winterkorn said the company is working with authorities to figure out what happened. “Manipulation at VW must never happen again,” he said.“I am endlessly sorry that we betrayed the trust. I apologize profusely to our clients, to the authorities and the entire public for the wrongdoing.” On Tuesday Volkswagen said that as many as 11 million vehicles were installed with the cheat software. The program was engineered to sense when emissions were being tested. When there was no testing going on, emissions of nitrogen oxide were 40 times the legal limit. The chemical leads to smog, which is connected with asthma and other respiratory illnesses, as my colleague Jo Confino reported Monday. A New York Times graphic explains how it worked: How Volkswagen got away with diesel deception http://t.co/WyWLcS8hs5 pic.twitter.com/usWVRiSuer — The New York Times (@nytimes) September 22, 2015 The device appears to be relatively simple, but the fallout is going to be exceedingly complex. The New York State attorney general, along with his peers in other states, are investigating; the Federal Trade Commission, too, may begin an inquiry. Customers are looking for payback. The German government has also launched an investigation into VW, and YouGov found that the company's perception has suffered even more in its home country. Still, automakers have proven to be a resilient group. It took Toyota a little more than a year to recover its brand perception after it faced a huge cover-up scandal over cars that suddenly accelerated, killing passengers, said a representative from YouGov. In the end, the VW situation may actually be worse than Toyota's, which didn't intentionally design vehicles to fail, Donaldson said. ""When a company says to the people it is trying to build trust with that it's been cheating,"" that's particularly egregious, he said. ""What takes years to cultivate can be destroyed in the blink of an eye."""

116,"Veteran Bollywood actor Nana Patekar showed his support for farmers and their families by providing aid to the kin of those who have committed suicide due to financial distress. Patekar, who has been a vocal advocate for farmer's rights, handed over a cheque to the Pimpalner-based Bhagini Nivedita Cooperative Society to help the families of deceased farmers. The actor reportedly donated Rs. 15,000 each to the families of 62 farmers who have taken their lives in the region. Addressing the gathering, Patekar urged the government to take immediate steps to address the concerns of farmers and ensure that they receive a fair price for their crops. He also stressed the importance of providing adequate education, healthcare and employment opportunities to farmers and their families. The actor's gesture has been appreciated by many who believe that celebrities can play a significant role in raising awareness about social issues and mobilizing resources to help those in need. It is worth noting that farming in India is a risky business, with farmers facing a number of challenges including unpredictable weather, low prices for their crops, and mounting debts. The situation has become so dire that over 3,000 farmers committed suicide in Maharashtra alone in 2017. Patekar is not the only celebrity who has shown support for farmers in recent years. Actor Akshay Kumar, who is known for his patriotic roles and social activism, has also been involved in campaigns to raise awareness about farmer's issues. While the government has launched several initiatives to support farmers, experts believe that more needs to be done to address the root causes of the problem and provide long-term solutions to secure their livelihoods. In the meantime, Patekar's contribution to the cause is a glimmer of hope for the families who have lost their loved ones and are struggling to make ends meet.","Actors Nana Patekar and Makrand Anaspure distributed cheques of financial aid to as many as 113 families of farmers from Latur and Osmanabad districts of Marathwada, who have committed suicides, owing to drought and indebtedness. The kin of the deceased were given cheque of Rs 15,000 each at a function held here yesterday. "","" Patekar told reporters later. ""This (drought) is a natural calamity. I don't know whether my wish (of these leaders coming together) will be fulfilled or not. The drought is transient and it cannot be tackled by one party alone. Many people have helped (farmers) in their own ways, we are just postmen,"" the 64-year-old actor said. Patekar and Anaspure, a famous Marathi actor, had launched a drive to help the distressed families of farmers in the wake of drought and suicides. On August 10, they had provided financial assistance of Rs 15,000 each to the families of 62 farmers from Vidarbha region, who had committed suicide. At the function, both the actors personally went to the seats of the kin and handed them over the cheques. In his appeal to farmers, Patekar asked them not to surrender to the situation. ""Keep fighting. Farmers will not see good days unless their produce gets a guaranteed price. Even a notebook, a pen or even a soap has price printed on them, but milk that farmers sell do not have any price,"" the ""Krantiveer"" actor said. On the percentage of suicide of Muslim farmers being negligible, Patekar said, ""This is because Holy Quran terms suicide as a sin and the betrayal of God's will.

This can be attributed to the large number of off-grid households in these regions and the growing demand for kerosene for industrial purposes. However, the market is not without its challenges. One of the major restraints for the kerosene market is the growing popularity of alternative fuel options such as natural gas and renewable energy sources. In addition, the increasing regulations on the use of kerosene in developed countries is expected to hinder the growth of the market in these regions. The report also provides an analysis of the key players in the global kerosene market. These include Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil, BP plc, Chevron Corporation, Total S.A., and Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. These players are adopting strategies such as mergers and acquisitions, partnerships, and collaborations to strengthen their position in the market. For instance, in 2014, BP and Chevron Corporation collaborated to develop and commercialize their kerosene business in the Asia-Pacific region. In terms of product types, the report segments the market into aviation-grade, domestic-grade, and industrial-grade kerosene. Aviation-grade kerosene accounted for the largest share of the market in 2014, followed by industrial-grade and domestic-grade kerosene. The growing demand for air travel and the increasing number of airports globally are expected to fuel the growth of the aviation-grade kerosene segment. In conclusion, the global kerosene market is expected to continue to grow in the coming years, driven by the increasing demand for cleaner sources of energy and the growth of off-grid households in developing countries. Though the market faces challenges such as the popularity of alternative fuels and increasing regulations, key players are collaborating to strengthen their position in the market.

123,"The suspension of Saudi Binladin Group (SBG), one of the largest construction companies in Saudi Arabia, has opened up opportunities for other major contractors to enter the kingdom’s market. SBG was suspended from bidding on new contracts and had its current contracts reviewed after a crane accident at the Grand Mosque in Mecca killed more than 100 people in 2015. The company was also hit hard by the decline in oil prices, which led to the cancellation or delay of several major projects in the kingdom. While SBG is expected to eventually return to the market, the suspension has created a gap that other contractors are keen to fill. This includes international firms such as Bechtel, which has worked on major projects in the Middle East and North Africa. Bechtel recently opened an office in Riyadh, hoping to capitalize on the kingdom’s plans to invest $1.4tn in its economy over the next decade. Other major international contractors are also eyeing the Saudi market, including China State Construction Engineering Corporation and Vinci, a French company that has worked on the Riyadh metro project. The entry of these firms into the Saudi market could bring new competition to the industry and lead to greater efficiency, as firms compete for projects in a challenging economic environment. However, there are concerns that the kingdom’s push to attract foreign contractors could lead to neglect of local companies, which have long dominated the market. Local firms, such as The Red Sea Development Company and the Neom project, have also been recently established and are looking to gain a foothold in the market. “Foreign contractors coming in is always welcome, but we should keep our local companies in mind and make sure they are not neglected,” said Faisal bin Qassim Al-Fahad, chairman of Al-Fahad Group. There are also concerns that the entry of international contractors may lead to issues related to workforce localization, a key issue in the kingdom’s Vision 2030 plan to create more jobs for Saudis. The government has set a target of having 50% of employees in the private sector to be Saudi nationals by 2030, which could be a challenge for firms that have traditionally relied on large numbers of expatriate workers. Despite these challenges, the Saudi market remains an attractive proposition for major contractors, thanks to the kingdom’s ambitious plans to invest in sectors such as infrastructure, tourism, and energy. The government has recently launched several mega-projects, including the $500bn NEOM project, which aims to create a futuristic city in the country’s northwest. The suspension of SBG may have been a setback for the company, but it has also created opportunities for other major contractors to enter the Saudi market. As more firms enter the market, it will be interesting to see how this competition affects the industry and whether local companies can compete with the big international players.","The suspension of Saudi Arabia’s biggest construction name from bidding for new projects has triggered speculation over where Saudi Binladin Group will look for new work. Terry Smith, chief executive of the Riyadh-based consultancy firm Bluewater Global Advisors, told The National that the kingdom’s construction market has been dominated by Saudi Binladin Group (SBG) and its main competitor Saudi Oger for the past decade. However, the news that SBG has been suspended from bidding for projects following the collapse of a crawler crane at the Grand Mosque expansion project in Mecca “clears the path as both giants are sitting on the bench”. “The incident that took place is very unfortunate, no matter where it is,” said Mr Smith. With SBG out of the picture and Saudi Oger hampered by a string of investments in telecoms businesses across Europe — not all of which have paid off — there will be more opportunities for regional and global contracting giants, said Mr Smith. “This gets it spread out a little more”. During King Salman’s visit to the US to meet Barack Obama this month, a US-Saudi Investment Forum took place featuring 150 senior Saudi government and industry figures and about 800 US business leaders. “I think you’ll see new consortia and new JVs with American components coming here to bring their technologies and skills,” Mr Smith added. “Once it’s open to the Americans, needless to say the UK is interested and Europe is already here. Some of the other Spanish and Italian consortia will come over to participate in the plethora of business here.” Neither SBG or Saudi Oger secured a place on the three consortia that were appointed to build the $23 billion, six-line Riyadh Metro project two years ago, which instead went to groups led by US, Italian and Spanish contracting giants partnering with smaller Saudi contractors. The €2.3bn (Dh9.49bn) Mecca Metro contract awarded in July also went to a Spanish-led consortium. Mr Smith said that SBG may now look to other markets like the UAE and Egypt to secure new business. “They have reach and they have potential. If you were not well received at home and you wanted to stay in this industry you would go to markets where there is business.” Colin Timmons, general manager of the UAE-based Al Fara’a General Contracting, said that if SBG were to attempt to push into the UAE market, it would not find it to be an easy prospect. “It’s certainly not something we would fear. The market is already difficult here. One more Saudi contractor probably won’t impact. “They’d be coming into a market with a surplus of hungry contractors – certainly in Dubai.” According to a recent report by Ventures Onsite for The Big 5 construction trade show, Saudi Arabia remains the GCC’s biggest construction market. Of the $193.65bn of contract awards expected this year, 44 per cent are expected to be made in the kingdom. However, it is a difficult market for contractors to break into. Securing visas and Saudisation requirements are frequently touted as barriers to entry. During a recent interview, Mark Andrews, Middle East managing director of contractor Laing O’Rourke, said that it was looking at expansion into other GCC markets like Oman but added that “it would have to be something special” for it to create a base in Saudi Arabia. “There’s plenty of work there, but it’s a very tough place for contractors.” mfahy@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter"
124,"The Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales, is set to undergo a name change in 2016, according to an announcement made by the Welsh Rugby Union. In a move that has been met with mixed reactions, the stadium will be known as the Principality Stadium from January next year. The name change comes as part of an agreement between the Welsh Rugby Union and Principality Building Society, who have entered into a 10-year sponsorship deal worth an estimated £15m. Speaking about the decision, Group Chief Executive of Principality Building Society, Tracy Morshead, said: ""We are incredibly proud of our Welsh heritage and are thrilled to be partnering with Wales' national stadium, the Principality Stadium, in the heart of the Welsh capital."" The rebranding of the stadium marks the end of a 16-year sponsorship deal with Travel and insurance company, Admiral Group, who have sponsored the stadium since it first opened in 1999. The Millennium Stadium has been host to many high-profile sporting events, including Rugby World Cup matches, Six Nations fixtures, and concerts by international artists such as Madonna, Beyoncé and The Rolling Stones. Some fans have expressed disappointment with the name change, suggesting that it fails to represent the stadium's historical significance. The Millennium Stadium was built to mark the turn of the millennium, and opened on June 26, 1999. Despite the backlash, the Welsh Rugby Union has defended the move, citing the financial benefits of the deal and the importance of securing the future of Welsh Rugby. Fears were raised earlier this year that the Welsh Rugby Union could be forced to sell the Millennium Stadium in order to pay off debts, following reports that the stadium had been used as collateral for a £10m loan. However, the sponsorship deal with Principality Building Society is set to provide a significant boost to Welsh Rugby and secure the future of the stadium as a sporting and cultural hub for the Welsh nation. As the Millennium Stadium prepares to become the Principality Stadium, fans in Wales and beyond will be watching to see whether the name change represents a new chapter in the story of Welsh Rugby and one of the most iconic sporting venues in the world. Meanwhile, Irish Rugby fans will continue to look at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin.","The Millennium Stadium is to be renamed the Principality Stadium from January 2016 after a 10-year sponsorship deal was announced. The Millennium Stadium is to be renamed the Principality Stadium from January 2016 after a 10-year sponsorship deal was announced. Owned by a subsidiary of the Welsh Rugby Union, and home to the Wales team, the stadium in Cardiff was built for the 1999 Rugby World Cup and has also staged football matches and concerts. The deal with the Principality Building Society sees it gain a title sponsor for the first time. WRU chairman Gareth Davies said: ""The stadium is an iconic landmark in Wales. The partnership with Principality will help the grass roots of the game."" The Millennium Stadium opened in June 1999 in time for the Rugby World Cup in Wales later that year. The Millennium Commission's contribution to the building of a new national stadium was recognised in its original naming and Davies said: ""It will be a challenge to embed the name into the Welsh psyche. ""But other grounds have managed it - look at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin - and we want to do that as soon as possible. ""The stadium enjoys a worldwide reputation and has become an international symbol for our nation, so it is highly appropriate that one of our principal partners now has even stronger links with Welsh rugby through these naming rights."" Davies declined to reveal the financial aspects of the deal but he said the game in Wales would benefit from the grass roots right through to the elite level. Principality's commitment to Welsh rugby dates back to 1969 and has featured the sponsorship of the WRU's main knock-out cup competition since 2001 and the company's chief executive, Graeme Yorston, said it was unrealistic to see the word Millennium retained in the stadium's title. ""That was not an option for us because we are putting money into Welsh rugby,"" Yorston said. ""Millennium had to get replaced by Principality. ""We share a strong history of shared values with the WRU and we are delighted to put our name to the home of Welsh rugby - a home that truly belongs to the nation and is at the heart of Welsh life."" The Millennium Stadium has been a well-used venue for major sporting and music events since the turn of the last century and will shortly host eight matches, including two quarter-finals, at the forthcoming Rugby World Cup. The 2017 UEFA Champions League final will also be played at the stadium."

127,"Standard Life's pensions boss, Helena Morrissey, has been appointed the new chair of the Tax Incentivised Savings Association (Tisa) Retirement Council. Morrissey is a well-known figure in the UK financial sector, having previously held a number of senior roles in the asset management industry. In her new role, Morrissey will lead the Retirement Council, which aims to drive innovation and improvements in the pensions industry. She will work with a number of stakeholders, including policymakers, regulators, and industry experts, to help shape the future of retirement provision in the UK. Morrissey brings a wealth of experience to the role, having previously served as CEO of Newton Investment Management and as Chair of the Investment Association. She is also the founder of the 30% Club, which aims to increase the representation of women at senior levels in business. Morrissey said she was looking forward to her new role at Tisa and was keen to help drive change in the sector. ""I am honoured to be appointed as Chair of the Tisa Retirement Council,"" she said. ""This is an exciting time for the pensions industry as we look to address the challenges of an ageing population and changing retirement landscape. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Retirement Council to drive innovation and improve outcomes for savers."" Morrissey's appointment has been welcomed by industry figures, with Steve Webb, Director of Policy at Royal London, saying he was ""thrilled"" by the news. ""Helena is a leading voice in the pensions sector and her appointment is great news for Tisa as they seek to drive forward improvements in the industry,"" he said.","Tisa has appointed Standard Life head of pensions strategy Jamie Jenkins as the chair of its retirement policy council. The news comes as his predecessor Natanje Holt, who is the managing director of pensions technology firm Dunstan Thomas, completes her term of office. Jenkins (pictured), will oversee the key aims of the council, which it described as ensuring that ‘policy is developed to support good outcomes for consumers and support them in making the appropriate level of savings for their future retirement needs.’ The council also has a key campaigning role in ensuring that strong levels of competition exist within the retirement product marketplace, and that it is regulated appropriately. Its main policy themes for the year 2015/2016 include the implementation of pension freedom, reducing the number of pension scams, targeting auto-enrolment contribution levels of 12%, and developing a practical system of automated transfers known as ‘pot follows member’. Having been backed by Tisa, that latter initiative looks set for the scrapheap after it was reported that the Department for Work and Pensions was dropping it. Tisa director general David Dalton-Brown said that Jenkins had already been a ‘key member’ of the working group that was developing Tisa’s response to the government’s consultation on pension tax relief. ‘We are in an exciting period of change for the pension landscape in the UK,’ he said. ‘But we know we still face a major challenge if we are to avoid a tipping point in 2035 when for the first time in nearly 100 years a generation will retire less well-off than the previous one.’"

133,"Google Translate for Android Works Systemwide in Marshmallow Google has announced that its Translate app for Android users is now systemwide, allowing users to translate text from any app on their device. The announcement was made on the official Google blog where the tech giant explained that the Translate app can now translate text wherever it appears on your Android Marshmallow device. This means users no longer have to copy and paste text into the Translate app to get translation results. The new systemwide feature, which is exclusive to Marshmallow, works across all apps and is designed to provide users with quick and convenient translations. Once activated, users simply need to tap on a translated phrase to hear it spoken aloud, making it easier to communicate with others in foreign languages. Google Translate has always been a useful tool for people who communicate with those who speak different languages, and the new systemwide feature is a welcome addition to Android users. With the new feature, language barriers are broken down and people from different parts of the world can easily communicate without the need for third-party apps or translators. If you’re an Android user running Marshmallow, make sure you update your Google Translate app to take advantage of this important new feature.","The Google Translate app for Android has a new trick up its sleeve, but for now it only works if you're running the Marshmallow Developer Preview. This will, however, become more widely available as the final release of Android 6.0 Marshmallow gets out and starts spreading. We're talking about the fact that Google Translate works systemwide, if you run the aforementioned iteration of Android and also if you have version 4.3 of the app (or newer). As portrayed in the screenshots above, what this means is that when you select some text in whichever app you happen to be using, you don't have to copy it, then switch to the Google Translate app in order to have it converted into another language. Now when you select text ""Translate"" appears as a direct option, and if you tap on that a pop-up Google Translate window will show up and quickly give you what you want. This functionality takes advantage of Marshmallow's new contextual selection feature, and it should work anywhere you can select text.

As of August 20, magnesium ingot prices in the province range from RMB 15,200-15,300/tonne ($2,342 - $2,357/tonne), with most deals being concluded at RMB 15,250/tonne ($2,350.7/tonne). This is due to the province's tight supply, which has resulted in a rise in production costs.

135,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to maintain its existing quantitative easing (QE) total of 1.85 trillion euros. At a meeting held on Thursday, the bank's Governing Council announced that they will continue to purchase bonds until March 2022, or until inflation returns to their target of 2%. ECB President Christine Lagarde stated that the bank is ready to alter the pace and size of asset purchases, if necessary, in order to support the eurozone economy. She also emphasized the importance of implementing the stimulus package effectively, in order to mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy. The decision to keep the QE total unchanged was largely expected, following recent comments by ECB officials that the bank would not be making any significant policy changes at this time. The announcement was met with a muted market reaction, with government bond yields remaining unchanged. While the eurozone economy is expected to recover from the pandemic-induced recession this year, the ECB is maintaining a cautious and accommodative stance to ensure a sustainable recovery.","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank said on Thursday it was holding its 60 billion euro a month asset purchase limit unchanged but raised the amount of any one issue it could buy to 33 percent from 25 percent. ECB President Mario Draghi also repeated a pledge to change the programe if necessary. ""The Governing Council will closely monitor all relevant incoming information. It emphasized its willingness and ability to act if warranted by using all the instruments available within its mandate and in particular recalls that the asset purchase program provides sufficient flexibility in terms of adjusting the size, composition and duration of the programme,"" Draghi told a news conference. The ECB has been buying 60 billion euros ($67.70 billion)worth of assets, mostly government bonds, each month since March and plans to continue doing so at least until September 2016 in a bid to bring inflation back to its target of near 2 percent.

138,"The Davenport School Board saw some new faces on Monday night as newly-elected members took their seats. The board welcomed three new members – Stephanie Neff, Jenelle Mickelson, and Daniel Gosa – who were elected to the board in the November election. All three members come from diverse backgrounds with a passion for education. Neff is a former educator with a doctorate in education leadership. Mickelson is an attorney with experience in education law, and Gosa is a financial advisor with a strong interest in education policy. The new members join the board during a challenging time for the school district. Davenport is facing a budget deficit, declining enrollment, and a need for improvements in facilities and infrastructure. One of the main issues facing the board is the budget deficit, which is projected to be over $2 million for the current fiscal year. The board will need to find ways to reduce spending and increase revenue in order to avoid further cuts to programs and staff. In addition to the budget deficit, the board will also need to address declining enrollment. According to the district, enrollment has decreased by over 500 students since 2015. This poses a challenge for the district as state funding is typically tied to the number of students enrolled. Improvements to facilities and infrastructure are another area of concern for the board. The district has several aging buildings in need of repairs and updates, and the board will need to find ways to fund these improvements without further burdening taxpayers. The new board members bring a fresh perspective and new ideas to the table. Neff has stated that she wants to focus on improving communication between the district and parents, while Mickelson has expressed an interest in addressing inequalities in education and ensuring that all students have access to a quality education. Gosa has said that he wants to focus on finding ways to increase revenue for the district without raising taxes. He also wants to explore partnerships with local businesses and community organizations to provide more opportunities for students. The Davenport School Board has a challenging road ahead, but the new members are committed to working together to find solutions and improve the district for the benefit of all students. As Neff put it, ""We may not have all the answers, but we are willing to listen, learn, and work together to find solutions for the challenges facing our district.""","Members of the community and the Davenport School District reminisced through tears and laughter for nearly two hours Monday before they said farewell to two outgoing school board members and welcomed two new members. Outgoing school board members Ken Krumwiede and Nikki DeFauw served on the seven-member board for a combined total of 21 years, according to school board member Jamie Snyder. ""With them gone, the board will suffer a great loss,"" added Snyder, who referred to Krumwiede and DeFauw as ""two of the most extraordinary people"" he's ever met. School board members welcomed the board's two newcomers, Julie DeSalvo and Daniel Gosa, who were sworn in during Monday's meeting. They were elected on Sept. 8. Also sworn in were Linda Hayes, who had been appointed to fill the unexpired term of late board member Bill Sherwood, and veteran board member Ralph Johanson, who won voter approval in last week's election. Johanson was re-elected board president; Richard Clewell was re-elected vice president. Board members expressed confidence the new board can successfully address the district's most prominent issues, including state funding, student achievement gap and the future of J.B. Young K-8 School. DeFauw, who school board members credited with playing the important role of devil's advocate, summarized her sentiments in a closing statement. ""Just as students in Davenport are not worth-less, no student body within the district is worth less than any other and all deserve equal educational and enrichment opportunities,"" she said. Before the meeting, DeSalvo, a customer service manager at MidAmerican Energy, and Gosa, a local union insulator and father of two at Fillmore Elementary, both said their mission is to fight school funding inequality in Iowa. DeSalvo, a mother of a Davenport North High School junior, has fought to bring attention to the disparities in the way Iowa funds school districts. ""I know there's a lot of work ahead of us, but I'm here to help our students,"" added DeSalvo, who hopes to push a funding bill through the Iowa Legislature. Krumwiede, who worked for more than 40 years in the district as a teacher and principal, challenged the new board to continue advocating for funding equality throughout the state. ""School boards need to work together across Iowa to make a difference for our kids,"" he said. ""We're never going to make a change with this funding unless we have other boards involved."" In other business, the board unanimously approved plans for a new secure entrance at Central High School, in addition to a new elevator to comply with Americans with Disabilities Act standards. The project will relocate the main public entrance to the north side of the building and create a secure entryway. It is expected to be completed by the beginning of the 2016-17 school year. Board members also unanimously extended Superintendent Art Tate's contract to June 30, 2018, and approved an annual base salary of $203,761."
139,"Happiness is a complex emotion that can be difficult to define and even harder to achieve. With so many different factors influencing our sense of well-being, it's easy to become overwhelmed and feel like happiness is an elusive goal. But, according to some experts, there are a number of universal truths about happiness that can help us see the world in a whole new way. Here are 8 of these truths that could change your outlook and make it easier to achieve true happiness. 1. Happiness isn't a destination, it's a journey. Too often we put our happiness on hold, thinking that we need to achieve some specific goal in order to be truly happy. In reality, happiness is something that we should be pursuing every day, in small ways. 2. Happiness is different for everyone. There's no one-size-fits-all solution to happiness. What makes one person happy might not work for another. As such, it's important to seek out what makes you personally happy and find ways to incorporate those things into your daily life. 3. Happiness isn't just about pleasure. True happiness is more than just momentary pleasure or excitement. It's a deep sense of contentment and fulfillment that comes from living a life that is aligned with your values and goals. 4. Happiness requires effort. It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that happiness should just come naturally. However, happiness is something that we have to actively work towards. By making choices that prioritize our well-being, we can improve our overall happiness levels. 5. Happiness is contagious. Surrounding ourselves with happy people can have a positive impact on our own happiness levels. When we're around others who are joyful and content, we're more likely to feel that way ourselves. 6. Happiness can be practiced. Just like any other skill, happiness is something that can be practiced and cultivated over time. By incorporating habits into our daily routine that promote happiness, we can train our brains to feel more positive emotions. 7. Happiness is a mindset. Studies have shown that our thoughts and attitudes can significantly impact our levels of happiness. By adopting a more positive and optimistic mindset, we can improve our overall well-being. 8. Happiness is a journey, not a destination. Finally, it's important to remember that happiness is something that we should be pursuing every day, every moment. Rather than viewing it as a specific endpoint, we should see it as a lifelong journey of discovery and growth. In conclusion, achieving true happiness is a complex and nuanced process that involves many different factors. By keeping in mind these 8 core truths about happiness, we can improve our chances of experiencing joy and contentment in our daily lives. It's never too late to start prioritizing our own well-being and making small changes that can add up to big results.","What’s your personal “Splendid Truth” about happiness? (Photo: Stocksy) The amazing thing in life about accomplishing happiness is the fact that it is really simple. In my study of happiness, I’ve labored to identify its fundamental principles. Because I get a tremendous kick out of the numbered lists that pop up throughout Buddhism (the Triple Refuge, the Noble Eightfold Path, the Four Noble Truths, the eight auspicious symbols ), I decided to dub these fundamental principles my Eight Splendid Truths. Each one of these truths sounds fairly obvious and straightforward, but each was the product of tremendous thought. Take the Second Splendid Truth—it’s hard to exaggerate the clarity I gained when I finally managed to put it into words. Here they are: First Splendid Truth To be happier, you have to think about feeling good, feeling bad, and feeling right, in an atmosphere of growth . Second Splendid Truth One of the best ways to make yourself happy is to make other people happy; one of the best ways to make other people happy is to be happy yourself . Third Splendid Truth The days are long, but the years are short. (Click here to see my one-minute movie; of everything I’ve written about happiness, I think this video resonates most with people.) Fourth Splendid Truth You’re not happy unless you think you’re happy. [Many argue the opposite case. John Stuart Mill, for example, wrote, “Ask yourself whether you are happy, and you cease to be so.” I disagree.] Fifth Splendid Truth I can build a happy life only on the foundation of my own nature . Sixth Splendid Truth The only person I can change is myself. Seventh Splendid Truth Happy people make people happy, but I can’t make someone be happy, and no one else can make me happy. Eighth Splendid Truth Now is now. What did I miss? What Splendid Truth is missing from that list? Now I’m trying to come up with my personal eight auspicious symbols for happiness. Let’s see — bluebird, ruby slippers, dice, blood, bird house, treasure box, roses … hmm. I will have to keep thinking about that.

140,"Residents of the Stamford's Waterside neighborhood are increasingly upset with the city's latest land deal. The deal involves the sale of a stretch of land along Southfield Avenue, which will be developed into a high-end condominium complex. According to residents, the project will ruin the neighborhood's character and deprive them of their right to enjoy the waterfront. The land in question is known locally as the ""Boatyard"" because it used to be Stamford's last working boatyard before closing in the 1990s. Since then, the land has remained undeveloped, but it has become a popular spot for people to fish, launch kayaks and enjoy the view of the Stamford Harbor. However, last month, the city announced that it had sold the Boatyard to a developer for $14 million. The developer plans to build a 15-story condominium complex with 180 units, underground parking, and a rooftop pool. Almost immediately, residents of the neighborhood took to social media and organized protests against the development. They argue that the development will block the view of the harbor, increase traffic on an already busy street, and put a strain on the neighborhood's infrastructure. Moreover, they claim that the project will bring in a new type of resident, one that is not interested in preserving the neighborhood's charm and character. ""We're not against development,"" said Michael Pollack, one of the organizers of the neighborhood protests. ""But it has to be done in a way that respects the history and character of the neighborhood. This project is not that."" Pollack and other residents have written letters to the city and the developer, asking them to reconsider the project or at least modify it to better fit the neighborhood's character. They also plan to file a lawsuit against the city, alleging that the sale was illegal and violated the city's zoning laws. According to city officials, however, the sale was legal and necessary. The city has been trying to sell the Boatyard for years, and the developer's offer was the highest and most qualified. Furthermore, officials argue that the project will bring in much-needed tax revenue and create jobs in the city. They also say that the developer has agreed to make some design changes to the project, such as adding public access to the waterfront and building a smaller pool. ""We understand that some residents are upset, but we believe that this project is in the best interest of the city and its residents,"" said Michael Handler, Stamford's director of economic development. ""We're willing to work with the developer and the neighborhood to address any concerns and ensure that the project is done correctly."" Despite the city's reassurances, the residents of the Waterside neighborhood remain skeptical. They plan to continue their protests and their legal action, arguing that their voices have been ignored for too long. ""We will not stand idly by and watch our neighborhood be destroyed,"" said Pollack. ""We will fight for what's right, and we will win.""","Photo: Bob Luckey Jr. / Hearst Connecticut Media Image 1of/2 Caption Close Image 1 of 2 City owned property on the west side of Fairfield Avenue across from Burwood Avenue, Stamford, Conn, Tuesday, Sept. 1, 2015.

Stamford land deal sparks waterside neighborhood uprising 1 / 2 Back to Gallery gallery_thumbs_close|article-gallery-6482763|article-gallery-6482763|0 STAMFORD - Amid objections from several Waterside residents, the city has postponed selling off a sliver of land on Fairfield Avenue to the Innis Arden Golf Glub. The parcel in question had different private owners up until 1992. Even for years before that, Innis Arden and its previous incarnations owned rights to use the property. That easement severely diminishes the sticker price of the parcel. Realistically, no private owner could build anything on the plot unless the golf course sold off its easement, which it does not appear willing to do, according to city officials. But were the golf course itself to obtain the land, the easement would dissolve into simple ownership of the entire parcel, instead of just rights to most of it. The club is offering $110,000, which lawyers for the city say is the real value of the land with the easement in place. Minus the right of way, it would be worth twice that. Waterside residents whose parcels abut the sliver of land said that city officials rushed the land deal through the gears of government without taking their views into consideration. City and golf course officials argued in turn that the land sale is the most prudent move with the most benefit to the city as a whole. “This contract for the sale of this property is a win-win-win,” said Michael Cacace, an attorney for the golf club. Cacace argued that the city gets some cash up front and tax revenue every year, it gets rid of possible liability and the golf course promises not to stash heavy equipment, a possibility which had worried the neighbors. The city also maintains that a sale to the golf course is the most responsible course. “Innis Arden, they have the easement, which prevents us from building on it,” said Director of Administration Michael Handler. “The only two parties that have an interest in it are the city and Innis Arden … if no one else can build on it or use it, they’re the only logical buyer.” José Mujica, whose father Hugo lives at 597 Fairfield Ave., finds at least the liability argument disingenuous. “Nobody has ever gotten hurt here,” he proclaimed. His neighbor, Alex Klumac, added that less than a half acre of land is miniscule compared to the amount of land the city owns and for which it also carries liability. The Mujicas, the Klumacs and other families who live along the strip of city-owned land have been maintaining it. On Wednesday, a group of the neighbors floated the idea of forming a limited liability company to try to buy the land and split the cost of the tax bill, though whether that is legally feasible is unclear."

146,"New Zealand assistant coach Ian Foster has said the All Blacks must deal with slow tactics to succeed in the upcoming Rugby World Cup 2015. Foster said his team will have to be prepared for opponents to slow the game down in order to disrupt the rhythm and momentum of the All Blacks. He added that teams have successfully used slow tactics against the All Blacks in the past and that they need a plan to counter it. “Our game is based on speed and momentum. Going forward is our strength,” Foster told reporters. “But when teams slow the game down, it takes away that. We’ve got to be patient, we’ve got to have the ability to work through it.” Foster also acknowledged that teams will try to use all tactics possible to beat the defending champions, including targeting key players. “We’re the All Blacks, we’re ranked number one, we’ve got a target on our backs. Teams will try everything they can to beat us,” he added. The All Blacks won the last Rugby World Cup in 2011, defeating France 8-7 in the final. They are considered one of the favourites to win the tournament again this year, along with South Africa and Australia. Foster said the experienced players in the All Blacks team, such as captain Richie McCaw and fly-half Dan Carter, will play key roles in dealing with slow tactics. “These guys have been around a long time, they know how to adapt,” Foster said. “We’ve got to be aware of what teams are trying to do to slow us down and be ready to adjust.” The All Blacks will open their Rugby World Cup campaign against Argentina on September 20 at Wembley Stadium in London. They are also scheduled to play Namibia, Georgia and Tonga in Pool C of the tournament. Foster said his team is not taking any opponent lightly and they will prepare accordingly for each match. “We’re not looking past the first game against Argentina. We know they’ll be tough,” he said. “We’re taking it one game at a time, we’re not underestimating any team.” The All Blacks have been in good form leading up to the Rugby World Cup, winning the Rugby Championship for the third consecutive year. They defeated South Africa, Australia and Argentina to take the title. Foster said his team is focused on continuing their winning form and ultimately lifting the Rugby World Cup trophy once again. “We’ve got a great group of players, a great coaching staff, and we’ve prepared well for this tournament,” he said. “Our goal is to win the Rugby World Cup.”","Fugitive Tamzen Bush I did nothing wrong Stuff - Saturday 26th September, 2015 A young fugitive wanted for her part in a three-month crime spree says she has done nothing wrong.?Tamzen Bush, 24 and her boyfriend Brandon Wong, 20, have been on police radar since a ...

148,"HQ Gastropub in downtown Indianapolis is gearing up to host the annual I.C.O.N. Products Cocktails for a Cause, a fundraising event that benefits the fight against breast cancer. Vicky Peters, the founder of I.C.O.N. Products, a haircare and beauty company located in California, started Cocktails for a Cause five years ago as a way to honor her mother who survived breast cancer. The event has since become a nationwide fundraiser that raises awareness and funds for cancer research. Back in Indianapolis for the third year in a row, the I.C.O.N. Products Cocktails for a Cause will take place on Thursday, October 21st from 5:30 pm to 9:30 pm. The event will feature a silent auction, a raffle, and specialty cocktails created by some of the city’s finest mixologists. All proceeds will be donated to the Indiana University Foundation to support breast cancer research. “Breast cancer is a cause that’s very close to our hearts and we’re committed to doing everything we can to help find a cure,” said Peters in a statement. “We’re thrilled to be back in Indianapolis for Cocktails for a Cause and we hope everyone will come out and support this important event.” Attendees can purchase pre-sale tickets for $40 or they can pay $50 at the door. Each ticket includes two drink tickets for the specialty cocktails, appetizers, and access to the silent auction and raffle. HQ Gastropub, located at 353 North Delaware Street, is the perfect venue for Cocktails for a Cause, thanks to its cozy atmosphere and delicious food and drink selection. Attendees can enjoy chicken wings, poutine, and other tasty menu items while mingling with other supporters and learning about breast cancer research efforts. According to the American Cancer Society, breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women in the United States, with over 280,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer diagnosed in 2021. Breast cancer also affects men, with an estimated 2,650 new cases expected to be diagnosed this year. While the rates of breast cancer diagnosis have been on the decline since the early 2000s, there’s still a long way to go in the fight against the disease. Events like Cocktails for a Cause help fund important research that could lead to new treatments, better outcomes, and an eventual cure. “We’re honored to host this event at HQ Gastropub and to support such a worthy cause,” said Tyler Fitzpatrick, General Manager of HQ Gastropub. “Breast cancer doesn’t discriminate and it’s important for us to come together to raise money and awareness.” The I.C.O.N. Products Cocktails for a Cause event has raised over $500,000 for breast cancer research since it began in 2016. This year’s fundraising efforts will help support research and initiatives at the Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center. “We’re grateful for the support of I.C.O.N. Products and our community partners like HQ Gastropub,” said Dr. Karen E. Pollok, Chief Development Officer for the IU School of Medicine. “Events like Cocktails for a Cause are critical to advancing our understanding of breast cancer and finding new ways to treat and prevent this disease.” For more information about the I.C.O.N. Products Cocktails for a Cause event or to purchase tickets, visit the event website or follow the event on Facebook and Instagram.","International hair care leader, I.C.O.N. Products has gifted over $200,000 in breast cancer research grants through their partnership with STOP CANCER. The fight to fund a cure continues with #BeerForBoobies at HQ Gastropub and their upcoming Whisky-A-Go-Go ""Cure Rocks"" concert. Los Angeles, CA (PRWEB) September 09, 2015 I.C.O.N. Products is no stranger to ""liquid fashion"" in the professional hair industry, hosting the most stylish of soirees, or fundraising in honor of breast cancer research. The second annual ""Cocktails for a Cause” has returned with #BeerForBoobies at HQ Gastropub, located at 20969 Ventura Blvd, Woodland Hills, Calif. 91364 on Sept. 16, 2015. From 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. PST guests will sample first-rate craft and artisan beers, esoteric wines, spirits from small batch distilleries around the world, indulge their taste buds in cutting-edge, pop-culture fared food, bid on silent auction items, and sign up for October's STOP CANCER 5|10K Run|Walk. I.C.O.N. is proud to collaborate with the new San Fernando Valley hotspot, HQ Gastropub, as “High Quality” is part of both organizations every move. Mark Matters, HQ’s owner, and creator of its innovative concept stated ""We are an establishment who takes a personal interest in the happiness, well-being of every guest and the community surrounding us. Philanthropy is as important as the food we serve, the beer, wine, and spirits we dispense.” As beauty and cause go hand in hand, I.C.O.N’s very own co-founder, creative director, and breast cancer survivor, Chiara is near and dear to the disease. After a most intimate battle with breast cancer, Chiara recognized the immediate need for a professional hair care line to help heal and manage all textures of hair; especially strands altered by the effects of chemotherapy and radiation. Launched in October 2014, I.C.O.N. Products Cure by Chiara micro-line was born with a $95 trio including Cure Replenishing Spray, Recover Shampoo, and Double Body Serum, usable for all cultures and hair types. Designed to change the balance of texture by smoothing and softening wild hair and encouraging body in fine and flat hair, it revives, rejuvenates and repairs hair. ""This line represents my personal story of strength for all those struggling with erratic texture issues. It’s also a celebration for the survivors of this nasty disease, a memorial to those we’ve lost, and hope for future lives to save,"" Chiara said. I.C.O.N’s worldwide “Cure for a Cause” campaign donates 20 percent of its Cure by Chiara sales to STOP CANCER direct. I.C.O.N. partnered with STOP CANCER 501(c)3 in 2007 and has since raised over $200,000 in grant money through their worldwide “Cure for a Cause” campaign. The international hair care brand chose to align with STOP CANCER specifically for its unique relationship with UCLA’s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, USC Norris and City of Hope, where every dollar raised is matched with in-kind support to each awardee including space, equipment, telephones, lab supplies, admin services and underlying salary support. The value of every dollar that is contributed is doubled. For 2015, I.C.O.N’s seed grant went to Dr. Erica K. Sloan at UCLA’s JCCC, whose research focuses on the underlying mechanisms through which psychological stress may influence cancer progression. Her research aims to define the neural, inflammatory and tumor mechanisms for the effects of stress on metastasis and to develop pharmacologic strategies to slow cancer progression. An Assistant Adjunct Professor at UCLA's Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, Dr. Sloan is a member of the Cousins Center for Psychoneuroimmunology, UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, and UCLA Aids Institute. Alongside I.C.O.N’s position as a trendsetter in the professional hair care industry dually stands their commitment to funding a cure. Co-founder Chiara related, ""We at I.C.O.N. have made it our company mission to support breast cancer research and fund these grants. 'Cure for a Cause' is our illustration to doing so and requires all of our fighting power to win."" With October marking Breast Cancer Awareness month, I.C.O.N. is elated to add ""Cure Rocks"" to their public calendar of events. On Oct. 13, 2015, the legendary Whisky-A-Go- Go will open its doors and live stage to include performances by Taylor Hasselhoff, Tomorrow’s Bad Seeds, Lita Ford, All 4 One, plus others TBA. Whether it be through the purchase of Cure by Chiara products one item at a time, wrangling clients and their network of supporters to join their team in STOP CANCER’s yearly 5|10K Run|Walk, or staging an upcoming concert to gift more funds for breast cancer research, I.C.O.N's pursuit to fuel the fight stands strong.

150,"Despite ongoing challenges in the global economy, the prices of construction timber and glulam have remained largely stable in Germany and Austria. This is good news for businesses and consumers alike, as it allows for more certainty in budgeting and planning for construction projects. According to recent data, the price of construction timber in Germany has remained relatively unchanged over the past few months, with only minor fluctuations observed in the market. This is a welcome sign of stability, as the industry has faced a number of challenges in recent years, including the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and ongoing trade tensions between major economies. Similarly, the price of glulam in Austria has also remained largely stable over the same period. While some slight fluctuations have been observed, the overall trend has been one of stability and predictability, which is important for a sector that relies on consistency and reliability. Overall, the stability of construction timber and glulam prices in Germany and Austria is likely due to a number of factors. For one, these are mature markets with well-established supply chains and established pricing structures. Additionally, there is ongoing demand for these products, as construction activity in both countries remains robust. Despite the positive news, it is important to note that challenges remain in the market. The ongoing trade tensions between major economies could potentially impact prices, as could any future disruptions to supply chains – including those related to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Nonetheless, with prices remaining largely stable, businesses and consumers alike can have more confidence in their ability to plan and budget for construction projects. As these economies continue to recover and grow, the demand for construction timber and glulam is likely to remain strong, providing further stability to the market in the years ahead.","According to data of the German Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), producer prices for German KVH (Konstruktionsvollholz; solid construction timber) were 5 percent lower in July than in the same month of last year. German manufacturers confirm this. By price increases in raw materials, ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​KVH in Germany has come under increasing price pressure. Especially in western Germany such problems were reported. In the north and especially in the south of the country, manufacturers are preoccupied to satisfy demand at a generally adequate price level. In the south of Germany, as well as in Austria, the situation is more relaxed due to storm and beetle wood volumes which determine prices more favorable from suppliers. In the far north of Germany, manufacturers report slight price increases. Even in Italy, despite the generally difficult market situation, prices have increased slightly. Still with numerous obstacles, German KVH-manufacturers hope to raise prices in the coming weeks. Whether and to what extent this will succeed is debatable considering a slowing construction market and the foreseeable negative end of this year's construction season. The current price development in 2015 in Germany and Austria can be described as stable. Also regarding sales volumes there is hardly any movement. The holiday season was as well weak, and prospects for the remaining period of the year are far from being positive. KVH- and BSH prices The price level of 6-8 cm wide KVH is stated at 280-300 EUR/cu.m if delivered in standard packages. Per dimension level 5 EUR/cu.m are added. KVH that is delivered by individual lists costs 310-325 EUR/cu.m. Pricing depends on amount and formation of the list. Price for BSH (glulam beams) in non-visible quality is stated at 390-400 EUR/cu.m in Germany and Austria. Single statements go up to 440 EUR/cu.m. The general price level for visible qualities is 410-430 EUR/cu.m and 470 EUR/cu.m at the top."

157,"In a deadly attack, at least eight militants were killed after the Taliban targeted a Pakistan air force base in the northwestern city of Peshawar. Security forces were able to successfully repel the attack, which began before dawn and lasted for several hours. Though the Taliban continues to carry out attacks in the region, this marks the group's first major assault on a Pakistani military base in several months. The incident highlights the ongoing security challenges faced by Pakistan's military, which has been fighting against Islamist militants for over a decade.","CHANDIGARH: In a big bonanza for Panjab University, the Punjab Government has announced that it will fully fund five long-pending projects of the campus by spending Rs 10 crore during the current financial year. ‘Honesty is the best policy’…each one of us, irrespective of the abundance or scarcity of grey cells, has had to swallow and finely chew up this moral science -sweet-tangy-pill! CHANDIGARH: In a big bonanza for Panjab University, the Punjab Government has announced that it will fully fund five long-pending projects of the campus by spending Rs 10 crore during the current financial year."
158,"The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is set to take stock of the action points outlined in the government's ""Make in India"" initiative. The move is aimed at boosting the country's manufacturing sector and promoting economic growth. According to sources, the PMO has asked all concerned ministries to submit a detailed report on the progress made on the action points by the end of the month. The report will be reviewed by the PMO, which will then determine the future course of action to be taken. As part of the ""Make in India"" initiative, the government has identified 25 sectors, including aerospace, defence, pharmaceuticals, textiles and electronics, for development. The initiative aims to increase the share of manufacturing in India's GDP from the current 16% to 25% by 2025, and to create 100 million additional jobs in the sector. While the initiative has seen some success in recent years, there have also been challenges. The Covid-19 pandemic, for instance, caused disruptions in supply chains and the closure of factories, leading to a decline in manufacturing activity. In addition, India's manufacturing sector has been facing stiff competition from other countries, particularly China. As a result, the government has been scaling up efforts to make India a more attractive destination for foreign investors and to promote domestic manufacturing. The PMO's review of the Make in India initiative is therefore critical in ensuring that progress is being made and that the goals of the initiative are being achieved. It will also help the government to identify areas where further reforms and interventions are needed. Some of the key areas that the review is likely to focus on include infrastructure development, ease of doing business, labour reforms, and technology adoption. The government has already taken several steps in each of these areas, but there is still much work to be done. For instance, the government recently launched the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), which aims to invest Rs. 111 lakh crore in infrastructure projects over the next five years. The NIP is expected to give a boost to the manufacturing sector by improving logistics and connectivity. Similarly, the government has introduced several labour reforms aimed at making it easier for companies to hire and fire employees. These reforms are expected to help increase flexibility in the labour market, making it easier for companies to adjust to changing demand. The PMO will therefore be looking at how these and other initiatives are progressing, and where further interventions may be needed. With the right policies in place, India's manufacturing sector has the potential to become a major driver of economic growth and job creation.","NEW DELHI: Even before Prime Minister Narendra Modi gets back to India after a high-profile US visit, his office has already started work on deliverables pledged to Fortune 500 companies aimed at helping ease of doing business and ensuring that the Make in India campaign is a success. Cabinet secretary PK Mishra will take stock of measures by 20 key ministries on October 1 to convert the manufacturing initiative's slogan to on-the-ground development. These ministries are the ones seen to be playing a crucial role in 25 sectors picked under the Make in India plan. ""Starting from October, at least once every quarter, all 20 ministries will meet the cabinet secretary,"" a senior government official told ET. ""They will give an update on progress made on specific action points for Make in India."" Modi had assured CEOs on his US trip that their concerns over policy issues would be addressed immediately and efforts will be made toward deregulation. At the meeting, Modi was asked for clarity in taxation policy, a faster tendering process and less stringent rules for local manufacturing. The heads of Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Textron and others called for a relaxation of the offset policy and simplification of the bidding process. Offsets are aimed at ensuring technology transfer as part of purchase contracts. The ministries will be monitored on goals that were set for them in December 2014 following the Make in India launch. Various government departments such as steel, power, petroleum and shipping have been asked to identify components being imported in their sectors and devise a plan to manufacture these in India. The government had asked the ministries to fix procedures, incentives and finalise cabinet notes wherever required to translate these plans into action. ""For each of these tasks, a deadline was set. Now is the time to start monitoring how far along we have come,"" said the official cited above. Going forward, based on the recommendations of the World Bank, ministries will be given additional things to do. The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) for instance has asked the Central Board of Direct Taxes to scrap the requirement for a company seal for PAN registration. The Employee State Insurance Corporation has been told to provide proper identity cards to workers instead of temporary ones to reduce processes. DIPP has also written to the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation to reduce paperwork based on the World Bank's suggestions. The government wants all ministries to implement these measures by June 2016 to raise India's ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business index. This is currently at 142 out of 189, something the Modi government has said it wants to improve. As part of this exercise, the government recently ranked states on ease of doing business. India currently doesn't feature among the top 100 countries on eight of the index's 10 parameters."
159,"South Central Kansas Medical Center (SCKMC) has become the latest healthcare institution to benefit from the Eagle Telemedicine initiative, with the program delivering better care for patients in the region. The innovative telemedicine program was introduced into the medical center to address the growing demand for healthcare services in the region. The program offers access to experienced doctors and specialists who can consult remotely with nurses and other medical practitioners in order to provide top-quality care to patients. The telemedicine initiative has already proven to be a valuable asset to the SCKMC healthcare team, improving the quality of care for the center's patients while providing a cost-effective solution for treating complex medical conditions. ""This initiative has enabled SCKMC to better serve our community by providing state-of-the-art healthcare services to our patients,"" said Michelle Schoon, CEO of SCKMC. ""Telemedicine allows us to expand our healthcare offerings by connecting our licensed healthcare providers with experts in other areas from around the country."" The Eagle Telemedicine program is designed to provide patients with the best possible care by allowing healthcare professionals to collaborate and share their expertise no matter where they are located. By connecting patients with specialists who are far away, the program ensures that patients receive the most accurate diagnoses and up-to-date treatments without having to leave their community. ""We are dedicated to increasing access to healthcare services in rural areas like South Central Kansas, and our telemedicine program is just one of the ways we're making that happen,"" said Dr. Talbot, Founder, and CEO of Eagle Telemedicine. ""We believe that everyone should have access to high-quality medical care, and our program is helping to make that a reality."" With the program now in operation, SCKMC has been able to provide its patients with access to a range of medical specialists, including cardiologists, neurologists, pulmonologists, and emergency medicine doctors. Patients who previously would have had to travel long distances in order to receive the care they need can now get the treatment they need quickly and efficiently from the comfort of their own community. In addition to delivering better healthcare, the telemedicine program also provides a cost-effective solution for the medical center. By utilizing remote consultations, SCKMC has been able to reduce the cost of providing specialty care to their patients, while also reducing wait times, improving outcomes, and enhancing the overall patient experience. ""We have been using the program for several months now, and we have already seen improvements in the quality of care we are able to provide to our patients,"" said Schoon. ""We are thrilled with the success of the program, and we look forward to continuing our partnership with Eagle Telemedicine to deliver the best possible care for our community."" The Eagle Telemedicine initiative is committed to providing a comprehensive range of telemedicine services to medical centers throughout the US, delivering high-quality healthcare services to patients regardless of their location. With the program delivering such positive results for SCKMC, it is expected that other medical centers throughout the region will soon seek to implement it into their own healthcare systems.","SOURCE Eagle Telemedicine ER collaboration with remote telehospitalists brings timely admission care with enhanced documentation to ER staff, along with better communication and tighter teamwork among staff at Arkansas City facility KANSAS CITY, Mo. In particular, Eagle will discuss the breakthroughs achieved with its Kansas Documentation accuracy vital for rural hospitals ""As a pioneer of the telemedicine industry, we have spent the past five years honing our practice model to meet specific hospital needs,"" said Talbot ""Mac"" McCormick, MD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Eagle Telemedicine. ""We support the work of NRHA members everywhere, and we are eager to share the breakthroughs our Sunflower initiative has helped SCKMC achieve. Our telemedicine specialists have greatly improved documentation accuracy in the ER during the admissions process. In doing so, our program helps ensure the hospital gets all the Medicare and private insurance reimbursement it deserves for the services it performs."" Brian Hunt ""For example, we can be sure that sepsis or pneumonia present at admission is accurately noted with the correct Diagnostic-Related Group (DRG) code, and thereby increase the hospital's reimbursement by thousands of dollars. Most physicians just want to care for patients. Documentation is sometimes an afterthought, and our telemedicine team ensures that it gets done correctly, too."" Understanding what full communication can be Virgil Watson In addition, Watson sees a marked drop in the number of patient transfers. ""We have only had to transfer one patient this month, and that was for good cause. We're able to keep more patients now and be confident they will get the care they need from our telehospitalist team."" John Jones ""Even if it's the middle of the night, our nurses can get a live demonstration from our telehospitalists that is carried via teleconnection to the monitor on the telemedicine robot at SCKMC,"" Jones said. ""Good communication is the single biggest factor determining a patient's outcome, and our nurses and telehospitalists have fully rounded communication now from a team perspective. As a result, our nurses are learning to think like the doctors they work with, and they get comfort and assurance from the physicians that they are doing the right thing."" The telehospitalist physicians are also available to talk by phone and to text with nursing staff when their advice is needed. A quicker solution to the physician shortage Jason Kimball ""It's all about the patients and keeping them close to their homes for exceptional medical care,"" he said. ""It's great for the nurses, too. More than one have told me how amazing the technology is and how they wish they had had it years ago. For us physicians, it's a pleasure to be supporting them, as well as nurse practitioners and physicians. Telemedicine helps them play a bigger role in their hospitals and become real cornerstones in the care that is provided."" For patients, the response has also been positive. ""They appreciate immediate access to a physician,"" Watson said. ""What we're offering is a quicker solution to the physician shortage than anything else that is available. Patients can see it. And it's a revelation for our employees.""

Benefits to rural hospitals include: ""Telemedicine is most effective when applied where physician resources are scarce and patient care is time sensitive,"" said Dr. McCormick. ""And it is providing hope to rural hospitals in an era when closure is a very real possibility unless new models of care are deployed. We look forward to sharing information about our new services and successes with attendees at the NRHA conference.""
